Marie, a Strategy Enterprise and Government Accounts Manager from Texas, has spent her nearly 14 years of tenure at T-Mobile gaining experience in several professional roles — and at the same time, taking on new roles as a student, a parent and a mentor.“I was hired as a part-time seasonal hire in retail pretty much straight out of high school. When I say that I’ve grown with the company, I have really grown with the company. This company has shaped and molded me. Working at T-Mobile has been life-changing. I remind my team, when we are making hiring decisions, ‘you have the opportunity to change someone’s life forever.’ I think sometimes it’s taken lightly, but it’s a really big responsibility.”Marie always wanted to earn her bachelor’s degree, and with a lot of hard work and T-Mobile’s support through EdAssist she graduated in 2018. While working towards her degree, she took parental leave, becoming a mom to a now-7-year-old. She returned to finish her remaining classes, then, with the encouragement of her mentors and T-Mobile’s education programs, pressed on. Marie graduated with a master’s in Business Administration in 2020. #UnstoppableTogether

Ever have one of those BRILLIANT days? When the stars are completely aligned? For me this was last Thursday. It was AMAZING!-       I got up really early, before dawn, feeling so strong, energised and full of positivity.-       I went for a walk for a couple of hours along the beach in the dawn sunshine, hearing waves and birdsong, and no traffic (see photo) – I even ran for a bit!-       I received a fabulous message from one of my mentees telling me how happy she is. She’s working hard, implementing changes, overcoming obstacles, embracing her natural wonderfulness; making her life so much better bit by bit and moving towards some pretty significant career and life goals. -       A gorgeous bouquet of flowers arrived for me - and it wasn’t even my birthday! From the same mentee appreciating my help and support recently.-       Then I was surprised with a beautiful rose by one of my friends as I sat working at my laptop in a coffee shop next to the florists. “I was just passing” she said.-       Some lovely friends, ex-colleagues who I have not seen for 16 years contacted to tell me they are coming to Dubai/Qatar for the World Cup and will be so excited to meet up. I can’t wait!-       I added my FIRST post on LinkedIn, fabulous considering I joined 10 years ago!-       I connected with more great people on LinkedIn, old friends and new friends.-       I finally finished a great accredited Positive Psychology certification, something I have been meaning to do for a while. -       All day almost everyone I met or passed smiled back at me as I smiled at them.Of course, not every day will be like this, some days will be a real challenge but Ralph Marston says it the best:“What you do today can improve all your tomorrows”What makes a brilliant day for you?#gratitude#positivity#motivation#positivevibes

It is often said that talent is what determines what you can do, motivation is what determines how much you are willing to do, and attitude is what determines how well you do it. This quote by Lou Holtz perfectly sums up this sentiment. While talent and motivation are important factors in success, it is ultimately your attitude that will determine how well you perform. If you have a positive attitude, you will be more likely to see the potential in every situation and persevere through difficulties. A negative attitude, on the other hand, will only lead to discouragement and frustration. It is important to remember that your attitude is something that you can choose – no one can control it but you. So regardless of your circumstances or how talented or motivated you may be, always choose to have a positive attitude. It will make all the difference in the world. #success #talent #motivation #positivity

You know what’s fun…getting recognized for working hard and having success!! How often do the people you work with tell you that you’re amazing, that they are proud of you…I know that wasn’t something I heard very often when I was a teacher.It’s crazy how a little positive recognition can completely change a persons productivity. So here’s my question to you…when’s the last time you were told at work that you are valuable, an asset and amazing? #primericaproud #positivity #recognition

What is going on? Why are we experiencing one turmoil after the other? Financial crises, speculative bubbles, market manipulation, money laundering carried out by fintech and major banks, scandals after scandals, Brexit, rising inequality, economic wars, military wars, the cost of living crisis, drugs and opioids crisis, mafia organisations involved in human trafficking, prostitution, arms and drugs sales, printing money like crazy, the mental health crises, two years of covid pandemic…Now, we are told, we are entering a two-year recession period 🤦🏼‍♂️. Instead of making things better, we are constantly bombarded by negative and depressive news. I have enough of all this madness 🤯. Fears and worries lower our immune system and damage our well-being. The media and the people in power must change! #mentalhealth #positivevibes #positivity #positivechanges

I’ve recently come across an interesting psychological phenomenon called “The Pygmalion Effect” or “Rosenthal Effect”, which states that: “Our beliefs about others influence our actions toward them, which impacts others beliefs about themselves & their actions towards us, which then reinforces our beliefs about them”!In simple terms, “Positive expectations about others influence their performance positively, and negative expectations influence performance negatively”!This was proven in an experiment done by Robert Rosenthal in 1964, in a single elementary school in California, where each student took a test which was designed as a mock IQ test. After the exam, the scores were not disclosed to the teachers, but they were told the names of the individual children who were said to be “intellectual bloomers”, who were actually average students. After the school year had passed, the children were asked to take the test again. All students scored higher, but the “intellectual bloomers” made the most progress, with First and Second Graders showing the most significant statistical gains.The study concluded that higher expectations by the teachers, had “subconsciously” led them to be more positive, give greater attention & more in-depth feedback to the students, which then positively contributed to the students results.Key takeaways for me & to all leaders and managers of others:#_1: Be Self Aware:Again, It all starts with your expectations of others that affect your behavior towards them. Be aware when you have low expectations of others, resulting in negative actions towards them. Avoid #confirmation_bias that can lead you to only spotting weaknesses in people confirming your beliefs. Instead, look at their positives and their potential. Being aware can help you proactively avoid negative actions, reducing negative results. Remember, positivity breeds positivity & negativity breeds negativity.#_2: Provide Equal Support & Coaching:One of the issues that occur with the Pygmalion effect is the lack of coaching and effort given to those with low expectations, as you may think “they won’t be able to improve”. However, before letting your expectations become a reality, give the person a chance to improve & develop, by providing equal access to resources & opportunities, including coaching, trainings & in depth feedback, which will help you make a fair and complete assessment on their performance.#positivemindset #positivity #selfawareness

One month ago, I had written a post on the declining IT jobs market due to a looming threat of recession around the World. (see screenshot)Now, it is sad that we are starting to see the effects of the same!Byju's is laying off its employees, and so did Twitter.A few thousand employees in India have already been laid off in the past few weeks.It means that the livelihood of these few thousand Indian families is going to be impacted.It's deeply saddening to see someone lose their primary source of income due to something which is out of their control.How can you and I help them out?If a friend/colleague of yours has been recently laid off, you can help them by:- Refer them within your company, if there are any vacancies- Tag them/Share any job opportunities suitable for them on LinkedIn- Write a shoutout post for them- Reach out to your friend circle for any relevant opportunities- Most importantly, provide them with mental/financial support which you can afford toSomeday you or I could be in the same situation, and someone else from your network might help you when you are laid off!Instead of just criticizing the decisions of the corporates, we could provide positivity by taking some small actions! Raghavan P#layoffs #byjus #twitter #jobmarket #jobopportunities #network #positivity

Are you a disrupter?  If you lead a team or teams, are their any disrupters within your organization?  How are you supporting them and allowing them to share their ideas?  There is so much opportunity to improve the way we do things and do away with “this is the way we always do it”..  When I hear that my ears perk up and I think about whether that is a good thing or does that mean it’s time to see what a new way would look like?  We live and work in a world of constant evolution and excitement.  Next time someone brings you and idea that seems crazy…. Ask yourself “ is it, or is it crazy we still do it this way”…. #leadershipmatters #positivity #opportunity #disrupter #changeisgood

Why do I succeed? I succeed because I am willing to do the things most are not. I will fight against the odds. I will sacrifice. I am not shackled by fear, insecurity or doubt. I feel those emotions but I drink them in and then swallow them away to the blackness of hell. I am motivated by accomplishment, not pride. Pride consumes the weak and kills their heart from within. If I fall... I will get up. If I am beaten... I will return. I will never stop getting better. I will never give up... EVER.#positivity #sucess #failure #weeklymotivation

" Duty will never reach the heart but love will "Have you observed people telling you that they did so much for this person and the person is not realizing the value of it?Have you observed parents telling kids that we are working so hard for their life and they are not even thinking about them?Have you observed lovers where a partner says I said so much for you and made all the efforts but you are not feeling grateful?It's not fair for the people who make the effort and do not get things back right.So let me tell you something,If you do something for someone out of duty you will never be fulfilled nor do the person on the receiving end will feel your effort. It's because there is no love in your action and just duty.On the other hand, if you do something with a sense of love, even a simple act of kindness will impact the other person so much and true love always grows. So there is no question of disappointment.My point is very simple,If you don't love someone please don't do anything for them. Even if you do disappointment is inevitable. Why unnecessary burden for you and makes another one guilty? Duty is for the world not for personal Life.If you are someone who got stuck by this I can help you get out of this. All you have to do is to book a judgement free session with me.Have you ever stuck in this loop before?#tasteofbliss #mentalhealth #experience #healing #growth #positivity #instagood #loveyourself #personaldevelopment #selflove #bliss #nature #lifecoach

You met many people get close and end up loosing them and get new people in your favorite list because that's is what the twist.You go for a unplanned trip and meet people and judge in first 5 minute & then understand their life journey and get inspired . Is a surprise for your life.You buy something precious but you loose them without your notice make you feel bad  but you move on make you surprise.You get hurt multiple time because you were attached to it but you being positive and thinking the best out of it.Life is an amazing journey.. people who are honest get lots of pain but god never leave them alone he teach lesson and same way he help in another way.Life is an amazing journey if your surrounded with positive people.Don't loose hope a dead clock is correct twice a day❤️Believe your self and always be positive and productive your life will be unbeatable 🤩Vignesh Nayak#life #amazing #positivity #learningandgrowing #experience #love #twist #lifelesson #believeinyourself #trust #honesty #integrity #respect #moveon

Not tryna bring any negative energy to the platform. It’s just that it sucks, when you feel like you can’t do shit for certain situations.Maybe, in the future I will really dive into my background and where I came from. For now, I wanna grind and grow.Overall, still looking forward to living life and coping.ALHAMDULILAH 🤲#lifeupdate #mindset #depression #positivity

Being a professional I get a lot of messages regarding right career choices and decisions that students want to make under proper guidance. Unfortunately we aren't provided with this basic necessity in our educational institutions which leaves the students in hard struggle for their career lines.Speaking of Nutrition in particular, we aren't told about the broad umbrella of Nutrition, Dietetics and it's diversity. Students don't even know they can choose specialization and continue to learn and practice in that domain. They lack "awareness of opportunities" out there to earn experience through internships and training programs. Many students come up with "Hmen kisi ne btaya hi ni" "Hmen pata hi ni k kahan kahan internship krwai jati""Is field me job kahan mily g?""Degree k bd kia kren? Agy admission kahan len"?etc. And these sort of statements are the same even when they are in their final years. When we initiated training department at NUTRIFY Pakistan, the main commitment was to deliver "Guidance & Counseling" on individual levels by relevant field experts so that one can decide with open eyes among those million multiple opportunities and must be able to create them as well. My students are my pride. One of them just got her joining call from a hospital she was eager to learn from. I feel humbled to be able to help(Alhamdulillah). I always say"Scope degree ka ni hota, Khud insan ka hota hai". A single degree won't make/break your future. It's your dedication, eagerness to learn, positivity and smart work that will distinct you from others. I wish everybody out there good luck.#careerguidance #careercounselling #careercoach #career #experience #training #opportunities #future #positivity #nutrifypakistan #nutritioncoaching #nutritioneducation #publichealth #learningdevelopment #careerdevelopment #networking #internship #mentoring

I am beginning to despise computer gaming and all involved in it unless it is for positive and righteous education, healthy development for children. I do not play computer games, never have and never will when there is so little time and much to do in this beautiful life on earth such as nature, oceans, reading, learning, talking with actual human beings etc. Our children plays at a bare minimum as well and still not enough time to be active in nature, how does one kid finds time to play digital games on earth I wonder?  We won’t have any off the violence nor waste of time games unless for brain development, creativity and education. As if it isn’t enough in our daily lives of mental illness igniting, negativism filled antisocial gaming, in our children’s lives, our homes, their education, now in the parks and nature? We generally have enough of a hard time as parents to bring our children out to the parks, nature and the reality of life as is. This is not the way to parenting and raising a mentally healthy children to call these ridiculous gaming trucks to your children's birthday parties parents. It is purely idiotic. Than we are the ones who have to deal with and pay for your families mental health issues as a society.

I love what I do, but sometimes I hesitate to say out loud that I'm a support engineer mainly as it's a bit hard to explain the nature of my work.I would like to share this thought with my LinkedIn family.How vital is a support engineer to any product/project?Support people are the 1st face of client interaction once when the product is delivered. Support people are the ones in any organization who will provide 24/7 service. No matter how, what, why, when, and where, we give hope to the client that we are always 'here to hear'. We take most of the heat up.We are the complete package, wonder how?We are the secondary developer - we run the code bruh!We are the secondary tester - test all user scenarios, mostly any issue client is facing.We are the secondary managers - we co-relate with various teams to get the issue fixed.We are the secondary sales team - with all the post-sales interactions/issues about the product coming to us.I take pride in what I do. This is just a reminder, a self-note to me and many like me.

Reflections...Ways in which my profession has enhanced and impacted 💥 my life and #human experience...A year ago today (still coming to terms with the reality that it has been a year) I moved on from one of the most transformational experiences of my career. For me, the last year has been unimaginably centering, taking stalk of my motivations, meeting and re-meeting more amazing humans, working with incredible companies, and outlining passion ❤ pursuits. In reflecting on my time at Acuitas Health I realized that a large portion of my growth came from the incredible humans around me. The opportunity to be with caring ❤ , off-the-charts intelligent 🤓, energetic ⚛ , and curious 🤔 people everyday is the opportunity of a lifetime and I couldn’t be more grateful for them (there are many, and you know who you are).Below are some of my parting words to the staff. I recall writing and reading this to the staff fondly and filled with emotion ❤ :“It is with mixed emotions that I announce that I will be moving on from Acuitas Health. The last 5 years have been some of the most rewarding years of my professional life. It's rare to start something from scratch, and work with a team that has achieved so much! Our stakeholders have given us the amazing opportunity to test and implement positively disruptive ideas in local healthcare. You all have made this journey amazing every second along the way. Thank you for being truly excited by and engaged in the vision of supporting providers in improving health and health care; provider intimacy, and patient centricity. Thank you for all that you have done for me, and all that you do for Acuitas. I will sincerely miss you all and the intelligence, energy, and passion you bring to your work. There are few things more motivating for me than to see you solving tough problems every day. You are a strong team, you support each other, and I could not be more proud of who you are, what you've accomplished, and what is next for you. The coming weeks will be busy as I transition out of the company; please know that I value each of you, and if there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to reach out.”Among many things, you’ve taught me that I am energized 🔋 by your personal and professional success. Your drive is my drive.You motivate me. Reach out. Let’s have coffee ☕ , or chat. #gratitude #grateful #team #people #talent #care #motivation #positivity #human #work #drive #health #healthcare #reflecting #success #career

We started our career just after completing the graduation.The situation and perception were different, at that time.Some of us might be having responsibilities and social pressure, which had affected the decisions of that time.Now, after having experience of some of the years, we can again evaluate ourselves. We can ask ourselves that the path chosen/ accepted in those circumstances are still meaningful and lead us towards our dreams.Do we just burn ourself in the tiring jobs and accept it as our fate??ORDo we do which give us pleasure and inspire us to do more and better??Things will be totally different, when one can relate himself from what he is doing.It's never too late to start chasing your dreams again.#success #dreams #dreamjobs #selection #jobs #positivity #mindsetmatters #leadership #leaders #projects #projectmanagement #supplychainmanagement #logistics #supplychain #career #experience

Being an anxious youngster myself, with no wellbeing toolbox to lean on, I’m passionate about empowering children so they don’t feel lost like I did.Here are some ways I look after my own wellbeing:⭐️ Staying active to release the endorphins I need for confidence in life and business.⭐️ Escaping real life through books and TV for a while⭐️ Travelling, exploring different cultures and new foods⭐️ Having flowers around my house to keep me calm and relaxedWhat do you do to feel positive?#mindmarvels #helpingkidslearn #communicatingwithkids #helpingkids #childrenswellbeing #educatingkids #education #wellbeing #wellness #selfcare #children #childhood #mentalhealth #positivity #career

You’ve probably experienced at least one of these situations: a loss, a broken relationship, a regrettable decision, words that were better left unsaid … or words that were never said. All are examples of a common thread that weaves together as part of the human experience. How did you handle them? Or perhaps more accurately, are you still handling them?https://lnkd.in/e-d5BKYy#letitgo #mindfulness #kindness #positivity #positivemindset #positivethoughts #positiveattitude #mindful #mindfulliving #motivation #motivationalquotes #trauma #healing #frequency #kinder #awareness #holistichealth #holisticwellness #wellbeing #time #health #healthy #healthandwellness #healthylifestyle #healthyliving #wellnessjourney Dr Nupi Arora Rasie Bamigbade - Leadership and Book Coach Rita 🧚 Ciarniello Nayomie Warren Terrence Johnson, DPC, LPC-S, BC-TMH, NCC Joan Williams Joanne Wu MD MBA Maitreyee Sen April Guilliams Momal Riaz Yermi Kurkus Gracie 🌻 Ruth Melendez Tramaine Yan Steven Buescher Krista Samimi Mama Mindy Olamide Williams (MediaPreneur) Wilfredo Laurente Jr Oprah Winfrey Velma Williams-Ward BSc.

I was once told that every job is essentially the same. It's converting complex data into usable information which can translate into action. This simple statement sparked my interest in solving problems, whether it was during my time in the Government working on policies, or in the private sector trying to strategise cost optimisation or revenue generation. Each had their own problems, ready to be solved by myself and a group of "meddling kids" (Scooby Doo reference).However, solutions, even for the best of intentions, will be blocked if it bodes ill omen to someone higher up. This was exemplified very succinctly rather recently in my career. For a particular program that I was tasked to oversee, its performance wasn't as expected by the committee. After looking at sales data, market research, business model, promotional activities, contracts and financial data, it was clear the program is unsustainable, and the best way forward is to exit and cut losses.Even equipped with the best intentions, this didn't bode well to some committee members and still persisted to carry on with the program. For about 6 months, the team worked tirelessly to give multiple financial simulations but it was obvious there was no recipe for breakeven, let alone success. This is with operation continuously burning a hole in the budget. In the end, there is no use in "flogging a dead horse" and the program was finally exited much to the dismay and frustration for some.This is an example of how the best solution to a problem, if hindered will have a negative impact internally within the organisation, and external stakeholders. As much as I would love a world where decisions are formulated, discussed and actioned without emotion, I'm not that naive to hope for such a world. If anything, I would like to advise all organisations and businesses to at least allow a safe environment for anyone to suggest solutions for problems within their working space based on collected data. It will do wonders for team morale and business performance.#problemsolving #solutions #intentions #opportunity #success #safeenvironment #equality #business #entrepreneur #positivity #team #job #data #marketresearch #commonsense

To those affected by the recent tech layoffs… I see you. And, I’m with you. 🫂I’ve been there. Many times over. It’s not a fun time. It’s honestly a gut punch and a kick in the ass at the same time. Ouch. But you know what? You may not know this yet, but this IS the best thing that ever happened to you. Seriously.You may not realize this for a while yet, but I promise you the best is yet to come. It’ll take work, but hey… you’ve got the time, right? Have a laugh. You deserve it. 😂 It’ll be OK.Here’s what you have to look forward to:• You’re going to realize life is precious and time-bound. You’re not bound to your job. You’re bound to your LIFE. Preserve it.• Stop and smell the roses.🌹Seriously. Get out of the house. Do something beautiful.• Get some extra sleep. Take a nap. 😴 Or two. You’ll thank yourself later.• OK, now dust off your bootstraps and put on your big girl underoos, and let’s do this! 🙌🏼• Update your resume, #linkedin profile, portfolio, and basically all the things you would want to showcase YOU.• Use your #network to its fullest potential. Your network can and will help you connect with others, provide resources, and honestly just about anything they can to help you. There are still good people in this world, I assure you.• Stay positive. Remain calm. Rest. Rinse and repeat. It’ll be OK!Above all else, know YOU’RE NOT ALONE. We’re ALL here for you. I know I am.And, while I’m no one special, if I can help with anything, please don’t be a LI-stranger. Reach out! I can help with resumes, presentations, branding, or just about anything related to “marketing” yourself. 🤗A FEW TIPS I’VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY:👉I highly recommend tracking your job search on something like Huntr. I’ve been using their app for years. YEARS! Didn’t I mention I’ve been laid off 5x in 5 years? True story.👉If you want a drop-dead gorgeous resume, I can’t recommend Novorésumé highly enough.👉If you want to be extra resourceful, and show your initiative and moxie, sign up for the email finder tool with Hunter.io. You get up to 50 email searches a month for free!Repeat after me… I’VE GOT THIS! 🤜🏼🤛🏼#layoffs #techindustry #network #networking #people #work #jobsearch #resume #help #community #reductioninforce  #powerofpositivity #eternaloptimist #recharge #life #positivity #2023goals

Thanks a bunch to each one of you who took time to send me good wishes and blessings on my birthday. 🙏 'Birthday' is a day that marks as completion of one more year of life. What I believe is our 'attribute' must be such that is worthy of receiving good wishes and blessings from people (known or unknown) each day. That makes one's life worth living. Each blessing means a lot to me. My life's journey is going great in terms of my 'mission' of bringing positive shifts in people's lives, caring for Mother Earth, Nature, Birds & Animals (in whatever way i am able to do), Oneness with the Universe, moving towards Acension, and each moment is gracefully taking me towards my life purpose. Grateful to the contribution of people who supported my journey so far 😇Om Namah Shivaye 🙏Love & Light to all🌟Shradha Dhanuka#gratitude #divinity #goodwishes #blessings #thankyou #positivity #grateful

THE EFFECTS OF A POSITIVE MINDSETWhen you adjust your overall mindset to positivity, it takes a lot more to knock you down. If you're in a bad mood and your coffee spills, you'll probably say that everything's going wrong that day and it'll be a huge negative aspect of your day, but if your coffee spills when you're having an overall good day, you can move past it and not let it affect your day. It's the same exact scenario and the same exact coffee that's spilled, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS YOUR OVERALL MINDSET THAT DICTATES THE OUTCOME.#elisthoughts#mentalhealth #therapy #socialwork #lmsw #psychology #mindset #positivity #healthy

The circle of #influence vs. the circle of #power significantly differentiated leaders from managers. A successful business owner needs to be both a strong leader and manager to get their team on board to follow them towards their vision of success. Leadership is about getting people to understand and believe in your vision and to work with you to achieve your goals. At the same time, managing is more about administering and ensuring the day-to-day things are happening as they should.

Every cloud has a silver lining - a metaphor for the bright side that usually accompanies even the darkest of troubles. Ever wonder how some people always seem so happy, like they never have a bad day? Even when going through tough times they always seem to stay optimistic and in control. Here’s a hint: it’s not a trait they’re born with. It’s something we can all learn by training our brain in that way. In fact, this training is necessary to calibrate our innate negativity bias which can be really useful to help us guard against threats. But, like any bias when in overdrive, it warps the way we view the world leaving us pessimistic, distrustful and cynical towards life. We know through scientific studies of mindfulness and meditation that we can reprogram neuropathways for optimism. Not the blind pollyanna kind, but more grounded, reasonable and realistic optimism. Clearing negative energy is an important strategy when it comes to holistic wellbeing. Develop a steady meditation practice and see yourself transform into a state of calm, positive, balanced being. One that helps you navigate life's storms with greater ease and grace. #silverlinings #negativitybias #positivity #optimism #medhainc #dailymms #bityoga #themedhaway

This video tells us many stories. For me it is about our ability to bounce back, to enjoy the journey and the paths that we can take, it is about ensuring we have a support system that will hold us no matter how many times we fall and maybe it is in the falling that there is beauty and joy. How boring it would have been if he had simply climbed up the stairs. When we find the resources, the strengths in our experiences and use that to help us find our dance and rhythm then I guess nothing can really knock us down. My session 2 and 3 of Positive Neuroplasticity helped me reflect on both the positive and negative and linking them so that each of them inform who I am. #positiveneuroplasticity #resilience #mentalhealth #success Patrick Verryn #coaching #positivity #journeytosuccess

Last week on the way to work I was thinking about how far God has brought me.Not just out of addiction and depression but also low self esteem.I can recall feeling weak, vulnerable, and having low self-esteem due to poor decisions that led me where I was in my early adulthood.I'd had dreams of starting a business and here I was re-establishing my life.I felt so far behind my peers.When would I heal? When would I be more confident? How long would it take catch up with everyone else?It wasn't a matter of catching up.  It was a matter of trusting and following God.Since then, God has strengthened me.He's given me hope and purpose, and those things I struggled with are a thing of the past. Although deep down there are probably things I am still healing from. If you are struggling with something, have hope.  Know that the healing process takes time.God will take you to places you've never dreamed of if you will put your hope in him.My boutique mission has recently been revised. I want to do more than just sell clothes.Boutique So Me's mission is to empower women to look fab and feel good, at affordable prices while inspiring people to hope, and to overcome life's challenges.If you or someone you know is needing hope or inspiration, invite them to follow Boutique So Me.

🧑🏽‍💼Leader ➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️Manager 👩🏽‍💼"Leadership" and "management" are often used interchangeably, but they describe two different types of authority. Companies need both to thrive.Being an excellent manager doesn't make someone a strong leader. We've all run into someone who uses the titles interchangeably, which can be frustrating.Knowing the difference between leadership vs. management helps you understand your role in your organization. Recognizing the difference can sharpen your abilities to reach your fullest potential. Knowing what separates managers and leaders can also help you figure out how to achieve the best balance of leadership and management qualities.✅Leaders create a vision, and managers create goals.☑️Leaders are change agents. Managers maintain the status quo.✅ Leaders are unique. Managers copy☑️ Leaders take risks. Managers control risk✅Leaders are in it for the long haul. Managers think short-term.☑️ Leaders grow personally, and managers rely on existing, proven skills.✅ Leaders build relationships, and managers build systems and processes.☑️Leaders coach, managers direct.✅ Leaders create fans. Managers have employeeshttp://ow.ly/jVP350LviZy 📱1-877-342-8823#management #business #leadership #marketing #entrepreneur #success #motivation #education #training #technology #coaching #manager #consulting #innovation #hr #finance #music #work #career #humanresources #innovation #work #smallbusiness #focus #team #mentor #lifecoach #positivity #networking #successmindset

Just randomly remembered a very little but a really sweet thing told by a little girl to me, during my internship days at Moolchand Medcity . Just after I took her counselling session, she said a few words - "Ma'am how do you stay so positive all the time that your words brought positive feelings inside me and I'm already feeling so light after this session and also, I don't know about how many patients like me you see in a day here but how do you stay so strong after listening to such next level and terrifying experiences of people like me". Hearing such appreciation from a little girl really made my day back then. And I responded to her by just saying a few words that "Your well - being is my priority. The way you are appreciating me and the fact that you will now get better, knowing that I got this opportunity to play a good part in your journey, this is what makes me strong. I also face breakdowns and a bit of instability being a human, but it's you who fill us with positivity. So it's not just me who brings positive in you and everyone, it's people like you who keep us going" This was just a random talk I got kinda nostalgia of right now so thought about why not to share . ✌🏻 #share #internship #awareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealth #psychology #speakup #positivepsychology #positivity

Daily Reminder: It's ok to talk about your feelings.It’s easy to feel like you need to “have it all together”, but talking about your feelings is the best way to find peace about a situation.Having an open, honest heart is not only good for your mental health but it allows you to emphasize more with others. Seeing your problems through someone else’s eyes challenges your perspective and makes room for clarity.Have a great day!

As an entrepreneur, it’s critical to have a positive mindset. This means staying positive and optimistic even when things are tough (cause they WILL get tough). It also means believing in yourself and your abilities, and knowing that you can overcome any challenge that comes your way.Here are some tips for cultivating a positive mindset:✨Everything is happening for you, not to you. When crappy things happen, or business doesn’t go the way you hoped... remember that everything that happens is an opportunity to learn something. Every successful entrepreneur has failed hundreds of times... it comes with the territory. Learn what you need to know and move on.✨Surround yourself with been there done that mentors and friends. It’s so easy to get wrapped up in the day to day grind of entrepreneurship. Surround yourself with guides and mentors who have been there, done that and can guide you through the rough patches with ease.✨Practice gratitude. One of the best ways to stay positive is to practice gratitude. Whenever something good happens, take a moment to appreciate it. I do a daily gratitude list in my journal and it’s a game changer.✨Meditate. Meditation can help you focus on the present moment and let go of negative thoughts and emotions. It’s a great way to relax and recharge, and it can also help you develop a positive mindset.The best way to keep a positive mindset is to have a morning routine that sets the stage for the day. If you don’t have a strong morning routine, I can help you put one together during a quick 90-minute call...

If there is one thing that I've started practicing post COVID, it's focusing only on what I can control and not worrying about what I can't. It allows me to stay calm and focused on my path and goals rather than getting bogged down by situations or other people's behaviour.When things are beyond your control and there is nothing you can do, why worry? – Gaur Gopal Das.Have a great week ahead!! 🙂#emotionalintelligence #people #positivity #mindfulness #growthmindet #growth #linkedinInfographics: Pinterest

WHY CHOOSE NEGATIVITY?!I've had bitter and sweet experiences dealing with people, both at work, at school, at home, at play etc and I can say for a fact that a positive mindset or positive environment boosts productivity. I guess that's also one of the reason LinkedIn feels like "home". People of positive minds, attitude and character makes life so much worth living and I guess that's what we really need at this time and age. The world feels so cold with enough negativity in it, we can only beat out her negativity by staying positive and sharing it's flame. 💘 Someone is losing hope about job seeking, speak positive words into their life!💘 Someone is battling a life threatening ailment, help them stay positive!💘 Someone is involved in an extreme debt and they're depressed, spark up positivity in them!💘 Someone makes a costly mistake and wants to abort that child, let them see positivity in their situation!💘 Someone feels her(his) home is about to break apart, pray with them and help them wear a positive mindset!💘 That employer feels you're not the best for their vacancy, stay positive!💘 You get rejections, stay positive!🔥Having a negative mindset would only cost you more!! 🔥Restore hope in yourself and spread it all around you. 🔥Wear a winning mindset. 🔥Sharpen someone's iron today. 🔥Stay positive. Not just for yourself but for people around you and people who will still come in contact with you. 🎀 Remember you can't give what you don't have. You can be the difference 🥂#positivity #positivevibes #positivemindset #mindset #weeklyinsights #liftothersup #productivity #fridaymotivation #weeklyinsights

- What if you unapologetically went after your desires?- What if you took the lead role in your own life?- What if you stepped into the most epic, most fulfilled version of you?People will try to keep you small. And that feels safe, I get it. You stay where you are because, even if it doesn’t feel good, at least it’s not pushing you outside your comfort zone.But if you’re ready … if you finally want to say f*ck it to everyone else’s expectations, rules, ideas, and limitations and find out just how powerful you are, it’s time to meet the hero of this story: You.This has been my continued journey, the mantra of resilience. To see me in every aspect, to be me wholly and authentically and to surround myself with humans who are ready to play the game in limitless thinking.This photo taken at Super Connector Mastermind in NYC really embodies the essence of this ethos. One of things I most love about my time spent with all of these incredible humans is their celebration of limitless thinking and their belief that every person present can be unleashed to their fullest potential. Spend time with people who celebrate you and not just tolerate you.#inspiration #motivation #love #instagood #life #quotes #success #instagram #lifestyle #motivationalquotes #positivevibes #inspirationalquotes #happiness #selflove #believe #mindset #goals #art #happy #fitness #follow #loveyourself #like #quoteoftheday #bhfyp #entrepreneur #positivity #photography #design #fashion

What do you do for a living?Most people identify themselves by their job or career. If this changes, they struggle with a loss of identity. When we take a job just for the pay or pursue a path that doesn't resonate with us, we negotiate our values - leading to unhappiness.Careers that fit your values are what make you happy. For example, if you have values in justice, liberty, family, and community, you might pursue law enforcement or legal life that will fulfill these values.So, are you ready to turn every day into the type of day that gets you excited enough to get you out of bed every morning?I can help with that!

Some antidepressants may cause problems if you have certain mental or physical health conditions. On the other hand, certain antidepressants may help treat other physical or mental health conditions along with depression. For example, many antidepressants may relieve symptoms of anxiety disorders. Bupropion may help you stop smoking. Other examples include using duloxetine to help with pain symptoms or fibromyalgia, or using amitriptyline to prevent migraines.Make an appointment 📅 with me today to discuss your options when it comes to improving your health!  https://bit.ly/GHHcall#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #anxiety #love #mentalhealthmatters #depression #motivation #health #wellness #mindfulness #healing #fitness #life #loveyourself #therapy #inspiration #happiness #mindset #positivity #positivevibes #meditation #mentalillness #psychology #wellbeing #happy

Faith. As small as the word seems, deeper is the meaning it carries.How can you use faith to get successful?As we embark on the journey of our personal and professional growth, we meet several people having a different mindsets. Some of them positively help us, and a few of them just add up fear to our belief system.We all have read the famous quote- “the world takes you as you are.” Yes it does. If you aren’t confident about what you want, how could people rely on your ideas or work?If you have faith in yourself, and in your dreams, nothing can stop you from achieving them. I have worked at various organizations, which at an early age seemed impossible, but my faith in my work helped me achieve everything I ever desired for. I always came across people asking me to concentrate on one niche, but I was confident about what I wanted. I learned, I believed and, I achieved. Little did I know then, that the ‘Magic’ of faith can create wonders in your life!Years passed by, and when I look back now, I realized how beautiful my life has been. How beautifully I have attracted opportunities having that immense faith in myself and my dreams.I still I am in the journey of learning, exploring and working on my future endeavors, and that’s why thought of posting something here, so that many out there, who still do not believe in their dreams could gain that confidence of taking a stand for their dreams.It is our unshakable belief and our confidence that helps us attract the life which we desire. Never second thought about your desires. Because you may never know, your faith can help you create wonders.There might be a few setbacks in the journey, but that does not mean you need to lose focus. Driving through the journey of life may be scary, but just keep working, and you shall have it.#growth #learning #opportunities #faith #personalgrowth #positivity #mindfulness

Optimism is not about being the lucky one to get hit with a “happy stick.” Optimism is a lifestyle, and it takes practice just like anything else. Optimism is an explanatory style. We cannot change what has happened to us in our lives, but we can reframe these experiences into something of value, something meaningful that contributes to our personal growth. #optimism #happiness #positivity #champlaincollege #smc

We are all defined by the strings that are pulling us in different directions - our families, our jobs, our passions, and the many other forces in our lives. But we have the power to define ourselves - to choose who we want to be, what we want to do, and what we want our lives to look like. So don't accept anyone else's definition of your life - accept nothing less than defining yourself on your own terms. Let go of those strings and embrace freedom, creativity, and possibility as you forge your own path forward.#inspirational #motivation #inspiration #inspirationalquotes #motivational #motivationalquotes #quotes #inspire #quoteoftheday #love #success #life #quote #mindset #positivevibes #positivity #entrepreneur #believe #goals #selflove #successquotes #happiness #lifestyle #bhfyp #instadaily #yourself #thoughts #loveyourself #photooftheday #lifequotes

There are four levels of consciousness.Inner child.Ego.Adult self.Higher self.All have a home in you.

JUMP.With all the stimulus, noise, chaos and expectations of modern life it’s easy to get stuck in to a comfortable routine. To begin spinning around ideas in your head only for the devil on the shoulder to start negating them. For the situation of paralysis by analysis to occur only for you to play the safe card, take the path of least resistance and to perpetuate in a cycle of unfulfilling stagnation. Often times it takes a significant life event such as an accident, a divorce or other to shock the psyche in to realising how long you have been in that state. It’s at that point you can either shy back in to that wheel of life or JUMP. To take jump it takes courage. To jump is the short term bigger risk but one with the long term reward being insurmountably higher. Sometimes the only smart option is to jump..“You don’t want to be the richest person in the graveyard “ - Tony Robbins.#jump #risk #takingsouls#mentalclarity #stressrelief #wellbeing #wellness #health #mentalhealth #selfcare #fitness #mindfulness #healthylifestyle #meditation #motivation #mentalhealthawareness #healthyliving #anxiety #lifestyle #healthy #happiness #mentalhealthmatters #mindset #life #therapy #relax #positivity

Body shaming one of the most insensitive act in our society which is a direct attack on other person's self esteem. Passing comments on other individual's appearance is very hurtful it damages other person's self image. For people around it just a comment or fun but victim carries that comment with his/her for longer period of time feeling helpless regarding their body image and effecting their mental health.So be kind to others and stop this inappropriate act of body shaming.DM me for one on one session.Your Coach 🌸Almira Sadaf 😊#wellness #wellnessjourney #bodyshaming #stopbodyshaming #positivity #positivevibes #positivethinking #bekind #bekindtoyourself #bekindtoothers #selfimprovement #selfimage #selfesteem #selfesteemboost #pisitiveselfimage #positiveselfesteem #selfesteemimportant

BD/IR professionals: Did you know that 35% of your interactions with investors are unplanned? Bespoke requests from LPs come in daily, and those impromptu interactions add up — totaling 13 hours each week, according to our latest survey of BD and IR professionals.  But, as any BD/IR professional knows, those interactions are critical to building relationships with allocators. And that’s prompting them to look for ways to boost their productivity in other ways.  Read our report to find out how BD/IR professionals are spending their working lives and how best to optimize their time in our latest report > https://lnkd.in/g5q-_5pH #assetmanagers #businessdevelopment #investorrelations

As an entrepreneur, it’s critical to have a positive mindset. This means staying positive and optimistic even when things are tough (cause they WILL get tough). It also means believing in yourself and your abilities, and knowing that you can overcome any challenge that comes your way.Here are some tips for cultivating a positive mindset:✨Everything is happening for you, not to you. When crappy things happen, or business doesn’t go the way you hoped... remember that everything that happens is an opportunity to learn something. Every successful entrepreneur has failed hundreds of times... it comes with the territory. Learn what you need to know and move on.✨Surround yourself with been there done that mentors and friends. It’s so easy to get wrapped up in the day to day grind of entrepreneurship. Surround yourself with guides and mentors who have been there, done that and can guide you through the rough patches with ease.✨Practice gratitude. One of the best ways to stay positive is to practice gratitude. Whenever something good happens, take a moment to appreciate it. I do a daily gratitude list in my journal and it’s a game changer.✨Meditate. Meditation can help you focus on the present moment and let go of negative thoughts and emotions. It’s a great way to relax and recharge, and it can also help you develop a positive mindset.The best way to keep a positive mindset is to have a morning routine that sets the stage for the day. If you don’t have a strong morning routine, I can help you put one together during a quick 90-minute call... DM me for deets.‌\#meditation #focusonthepositive #mindfulness #positivemindset #motivation #positivity #practicegratitude #entrepreneurship #entrepreneur #bekindtoyourself #selfworth #youareworthy #selflove

Some antidepressants may cause problems if you have certain mental or physical health conditions. On the other hand, certain antidepressants may help treat other physical or mental health conditions along with depression. For example, many antidepressants may relieve symptoms of anxiety disorders. Bupropion may help you stop smoking.

"TWO TIPS TO HELP YOU TAP INTO YOUR INTUITION ✨🌀1️⃣ Remember it’s always there — it doesn't turn on or off, it’s always within you, we just don't listen to it as much. So, remind yourself that your intuition is always active and ready to work with you.2️⃣ Don't overthink it — you won't know “for sure” whether or not something is in your head or your intuition if you keep wondering, try relaxing into it and don't overthink it! Your intuition is an internal tool that’s always working in your favor. What I love reminding people is that just like a muscle, the more you use it, the stronger it becomes. So, don't be afraid to use it. Take action on your intuition and allow it to show up. If you're ready to play with your intuition and strengthen it, comment below with a YES 👇🏽👇🏽"...#Empower2BTheBest #mentalhealth #selfawareness #nevergiveup #faith #happinessmatters #selfcarematters #besafe #mindbodysoul #positivity #love #mentalhealthawareness #gratitude

Don't wait for the ideal moment to make things happen! Perfection is a rare occurrence, so if that's your standard to take action, then you'll be held up for a long time! No moment is flawless, but achievement will make you forget your woes! Stalling only delays your victory, so keep going no matter what!In the UK, today marks the day an English king survived an assassination attempt, & centuries later, the explosives he would have used to cause chaos has become a joyful tool in celebration!

- What if you unapologetically went after your desires?- What if you took the lead role in your own life?- What if you stepped into the most epic, most fulfilled version of you?People will try to keep you small. And that feels safe, I get it. You stay where you are because, even if it doesn’t feel good, at least it’s not pushing you outside your comfort zone.But if you’re ready … if you finally want to say f*ck it to everyone else’s expectations, rules, ideas, and limitations and find out just how powerful you are, it’s time to meet the hero of this story: You.This photo taken at Super Connector Mastermind in NYC really embodies the essence of this ethos. One of things I most love about my time spent with all of these incredible humans is their celebration of limitless thinking and their belief that every person present can be unleashed to their fullest potential. Spend time with people who celebrate you and not just tolerate you.#inspiration #motivation #love #instagood #life #quotes #success #instagram #lifestyle #motivationalquotes #positivevibes #inspirationalquotes #happiness #selflove #believe #mindset #goals #art #happy #fitness #follow #loveyourself #like #quoteoftheday #bhfyp #entrepreneur #positivity #photography #design #fashion

Many people are conscious of an inner voice that provides a running monologue throughout the day and even into the night. It can keep you up all night.Cheerful and supportive or negative and self defeating, this internal chatter is referred to as self-talk (waldenu.edu)According to Psychology Today, 'This inner voice combines conscious thoughts with unconscious beliefs and biases... this voice is useful when it is positive, talking down fears and bolstering confidence. However, the human mind is prone to negative self talk too, and this negativity can be unrealistic and even harmful, paralyzing people into inaction and self-absorption to the point of being unaware of the world around them'. With this in mind, I believe it is imperative that we make a conscious effort to try and remain positive in our self-talk - we need to be kind to ourselves within our own thoughts to maximize our potential. We should always acknowledge the negative, sad or harmful self-talk and consider talking back to it by asking yourself, "why do I keep thinking about this?" "Is this really true?" "Why am I punishing myself with this thought?" In other words, consider looking at it with curiosity. What do you think?

So while i think opening my own wholesale account was a brilliant thing to do, I get its not for everyone. Luckily we can sell retail too. So if there is something you need and its not the right time for you open your own wholesale account we can still help you get the oils you need. Most active wellness advocates place their orders during the first week or so of each month so let us know towards the end of the month what you need for the upcoming month and well be sure to include it with our monthly order. 🌷🌷🌷Website: https://rpb.li/..Love what we do?
