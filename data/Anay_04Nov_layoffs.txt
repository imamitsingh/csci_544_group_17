Could not agree more. Empathy and dignity are the most important elements for companies to exude in times like these. It appears that several companies have forgotten that their #employerbrand is just as important (if not more important) on the way out than on the way in.

I'm surprised I haven't seen more coverage of this email from Stripe CEO following their layoffs this week.  A colleague shared it with me this morning.  With so many layoffs happening right now, this is an excellent example of leading with humanity through really hard decisions and discussions.  In the words of Bren√© Brown, "Clear is kind, unclear is unkind." A few words come to mind after I read this - accountability, vulnerability, empathy and kindness.  Traits that more leaders should lead with and few do.If you've been impacted by a layoff, I've been there, let me know how I can help.  #layoffs

Yesterday, Stripe announced #layoffs and it hit one of our closest friends from UCLA Anderson School of Management. If you or your team have open positions for Implementation Consultants, Solution Engineers, or within partnerships/sales please feel free to reach out to me or directly to her. #stripe #uclaanderson #mba

The way Twitter executed the layoff is absolutely disheartening but ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs Elon‚Äôs show now and he is not gonna run a charity. Business makes entrepreneurs ruthless & emotionless, that‚Äôs actually true. Elon was inhumane definitely but not only Elon is responsible for the situation - when Elon was threatening to back off, it was the investors and the top executives including Parag himself who tried to drag him to the court and eventually materialised the takeover deal. Value yourself and your skills more than anything. Your relationship with the company is mostly transactional. #Linkedin #layoffs #twitter

I woke up this morning thinking about my friends and colleagues at Lyft after yesterday's layoffs.

If there's anything I can do to support you or help you on your search, say the word.And for those who are still there, I'm sending you strength and good energy to keep working toward that bold mission.

You are not your layoff.This picture was taken shortly after I was laid off in 2017.  It is one of my favorite pictures.This picture was taken toward the end of a safari we planned and booked through Costco within a 3 week period.It perfectly captures the moment, the smile, when I was able to begin to let go of the defeat, humiliation, and insecurity caused by a layoff.  It took completely unpluggingAnd traveling to another continentAnd seeing a lionAnd a zebraFor everyone impacted by these recent layoffs, you will have this same moment.

It was 10:00PM last night when I started going through Twitter and saw the layoffs happening Tweet after tweet of thousands of people using the HT #OneTeamIt felt surreal. Devastating.

Being impacted by #layoffs last week I intended to sit at a coffee shop for most of the day and apply for jobs but decided to bring a chair down to the beach with one of my favorite books instead. I‚Äôve been looking for jobs and stressing all week, and honestly seeing more layoffs occur daily has me feeling like I‚Äôm in a hole that‚Äôs spiraling. So today I needed a break. Instantly feel more mentally refreshed and grounded. If you‚Äôve been impacted as well please be kind to yourself and give yourself some grace. We got this.
-----------------------------
I want to offer any support I can to those at Twitter and Lyft and otherwise who have been affected by layoffs. I have been there. It‚Äôs heartbreaking and a time of fear and anger. Better will find you. Stay strong, some very lucky organizations will reap the benefits of this pool of talent that is now available.#layoffs

Stripe laid off 1100 employees yesterday.¬†¬†It makes me sad that we are now giving the CEO heaps of praise because he did it the ‚Äúright way.‚ÄùYes, they did it the right way.Yes, the CEO took responsibility. He showed empathy. He was transparent and honest.¬†Yes, they are taking care of those affected. They are offering severance and health care and help finding new jobs. Yes, they laid people off with direct managers and humanely.But we shouldn‚Äôt be impressed.Why?¬†Because this should be the norm. This shouldn‚Äôt be the case of a hero CEO.¬†This should be any company that is forced to make these difficult decisions.  This should just be how it is. They worked hard for you. They did all that was asked of them. They did nothing incorrectly other than working at the wrong place at the wrong time.Instead of giving heaps of praise to a CEO that just laid off 1100 people and did it "right"...Why don‚Äôt we see layoffs as disruption to PEOPLE. We are throwing thousands of HUMANS with real families, real bills, and real needs into chaos. Until then.. I‚Äôm glad the CEO did what he did and happy for those affected that  they worked for a company with a moral conscience  I just wish it was the norm instead of the exception.¬†Be a good human#layoffs #ceos #leadership #opentowork

I have a friend who works at a startup. Last week, HR invited her to a ‚ÄúHR check-in‚Äù meeting the following Tuesday.¬†We‚Äôve all been reading the news. In this climate, how would you feel if you got that meeting on your calendar?¬†Turned out it was a totally innocent touch-base. But it took a full weekend and two extra business days for her to feel confident that she wouldn‚Äôt be unemployed by Wednesday.¬†Pro tip: If you‚Äôre someone with hiring and firing power at your company‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt do that. These are anxious times, let‚Äôs at least do the bare minimum to make our colleagues feel safe and comfortable when we can. #companyculture #layoffs #hr

Recent #layoffs in the market signal that the era of easy investor money and ‚Äúgrowth at all costs‚Äù is ending.The global economic situation will lead to more layoffs in venture-funded sectors once investor flow dries up. While self-funded companies with streamlined operations are a safeguard against investment downturns.¬†When choosing an #employer, employees would be wise to look for #sustainability over ‚Äúgrowing at all cost‚Äù companies.Despite the massive layoffs, self-sustainable companies keep hiring real talent.We at Dexatel have 30 newly opened positions as a part of our regional expansion plan.Link in the comment.

What a ride. After 9 years, this is not how I thought it would end, but today is my last day at Twitter. It has been one of the best experiences of my life and I‚Äôve met so many amazing people during that time who will be friends for life. For that I will always be grateful.It‚Äôs hard to explain, but #Twitter was truly a special place and the #oneteam culture we created will be hard to replicate. There are too many to name, but thank you to everyone who made it so great along the way.That said, if you or anyone you know is looking for a Sr. Recruiter with a passion for ML and helping build great teams, please let me know. #layoffs #lovewhereyouwork #recruiting #tweeps #opentowork

A genuine request to the leaders in the organizations who have the power to layoff employees. I am seeing a lot of layoffs in the past few days and thinking about the hardworking and dedicated immigrants who are working in the US on H1B visas. For immigrants on the H1B visas, this time is the worst time to be out of job and below are the few reasons:1. Employees on H1b visa get only 60 days to find a new job or else they have to leave the country with their family. Think about the people who have bought homes in the US and have kids going to school. We are displacing families. 2. Especially this time of the year when we are approaching holidays, it is really the toughest time to get a new job. Either companies are out of hiring budget or the interview process takes a lot longer because of holiday plans of the interviewers. Landing a new job is really tough in just 60 days.What leaders can do to show more empathy to the immigrant employees?1. Instead of just giving them a severance package, keep them on the payroll for the next couple of months so that they get additional 60 days to find a new job and be covered during the holiday season.2.  Candidates, if you are laid off, ask your employer and work with them on the solution so that you can get extended days on the payroll as each day counts in these hard times. Again, I am not saying that companies should not do layoffs, but showing empathy to a certain set of employees and understanding their legal situation will surely go a long way. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any help or you want me to connect you with someone in the network for any job opportunity.#layoffs #h1bvisa #immigration

The Twitter layoff is senseless. Acquiring a company after so many controversies and sacking 50% of employees in a week, looks more like a personal vendetta.

I‚Äôm pissed off about these layoff announcements. I have witnessed some of the most irresponsible decision-making. Extravagant spending. Absurd expense accounts. Multiple millions of dollars thrown out the window for failed projects.

Tell them over email. But make sure those in our inner circles are taken care of.

An air of gloom has clouded this week with layoffs impacting a lot of people across Lyft, Stripe, and Twitter (to name a few).

Time and time again, tech leaders commoditize hiring during periods of peak growth.They use headcount size and velocity to send signals of success to the market. But bloated cap tables aren't signals of success, rather they are signs of unsustainable growth and inefficiency. Unfortunately, our fellow talent leaders pay the heftiest price. People typically account for 70% of business OpEx. . .. . .And so of course, recruitment teams are seen as the biggest cost center and are often the first to go.Today's era calls for a different approach to talent management. To stay nimble, people leaders are going to have to introduce more flexible talent structures to their organization; fractional and embedded recruitment solutions that can scale up or down at a moment's notice. . .We've seen this in many different verticals; marketing agencies, IT, management consulting, and other service-based organizations popularly deploy "full stack" engagement teams that can manage workflows end-to-end, and at the fraction of the cost. Core people teams should be given the opportunity to be up-skilled and trained across the organization. That's where our value is. . .Transformation > Transaction#layoffs

The layoff problem we see across tech is not a new problem,¬†but we're seeing it with increased frequency in the #futureofwork At the core of the problem is an imbalance of full-time and flexible talent.¬†That's why I made it¬†HireScale's mission to "help technology employers¬†balance the need for both full-time and flexible workers, while also supporting the ongoing mobility of talent¬†in a constantly fluctuating hiring market".We do this through a hiring platform that includes a global talent marketplace, future-of-work job board and a vendor hub. Now, companies can better balance hiring with access to vetted profiles of FTE's, freelancers, consultants, agencies and vendors all-in-one place.There's good talent to be had. Companies just have to think outside of the box and stop getting into these predicaments where they over hire FTE's.Are you ready to balance hiring and solve the layoff problem once and for all?üö´ #layoffs

Use Formatting Available in Tableau My first tip for making beautiful bar charts in Tableau is to use the formatting options you already have available in Tableau. Consider the following Sales by Category bar chart pictured to the right that shows all of the default Tableau settings. This bar chart gets the job done, as you can immediately decipher that Technology leads the way with over $800,000 in sales, Furniture contributes the second most, and Office Supplies contribute the least. However, there are several opportunities to make this bar chart more engaging and effective. The most obvious of which is to widen the columns so the categories can be read.¬†#hupry is hiring; follow the Linkedin Page for the detailsFollow #hupry üëâ¬†https://lnkd.in/eifJ6ypC#hupry #cybersecurity #privacy #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #ai #aiforgood #aiforall #ml #bigdata #datascience #dataanalytics #dataanalysis #data #datasecurity #datagovernance #financialservices #healthcare #scienceandtechnology #privacycompliance #privacycompliance #deeptech #deeplearning #devops #neuralnetworks #layoffs #layoff #engineers #java #javascript #python #mathematics

I recently made a personal and vulnerable post to help my household, and unfortunately I must do so again - as of this morning I was impacted by a company layoff.

Please respond if you see a post for help or have any roles open at your company. They will add value to your business and culture.#twitter #layoffs #unemployment

Well, folks. I've been chopped by the new management at Twitter, along with 50% of the company. I'm grateful for the experiences and the people I met during my time as a tweep. Truly the most talented, compassionate group of people I've ever worked with, and I will probably spend the rest of my career trying to find or replicate that magic. For those still there, hang in there. You've got this. üíôNow that I'm finally off that ride, I'm looking forward to whatever's next. Going to take some time to travel, spend quality time with loved ones and my community, THEN map out my next moves.‚úåüèº signing off!#gratitude #marketing #tech #layoffs #opentowork

Fixed the first paragraph of Twitters Layoff email to be more clear. What an absolute goon... "Team,To place Elon on a path to increased wealth and political influence, we will go through the difficult for you process of firing some of our family and friends on Friday. We know that this will hurt thousands of human beings who have made personal sacrifices for Twitter in return for stability, but this action is necessary to ensure Elon‚Äôs success moving forward."#layoffs #twitter
-----------------------------
As we continue to hear about more #layoffs within the tech space, it makes me wonder...At what point will investors/boards turn their gaze to leadership and assess if they have the right leaders in place?  I understand that sometimes circumstances are unavoidable, however in this case there seems to be a lack of strategy, planning, and understanding of the principles of scalability within the C-Suites of many companies who are affecting peoples lives in major way.  Bad leadership + lean resources doesn't sound like a winning strategy to me.

It‚Äôs unfortunate that my time at¬†F5 has come to an end. The downsizing and reorganization have affected my job here.

Anyone with the slightest of empathy and true leadership skill will know that it is much more expensive and time consuming to layoff your best employees, re-hire, and re-train to achieve the same efficiency. I‚Äôm sad and angry to see how #elonmusk is treating my best friend and colleague, Rachel S., who was affected by the #twitter #layoffs I saw first hand the impeccable work Rachel does. She is one of the hardest workers I know. Of course, I expect nothing less from someone like Rachel, at a young age moved across the world to attend college in the US and achieved her masters in Ivy League. As she grows into a leadership position, the amount of thoughts she put in her work shows in the output. She thinks a few steps ahead for the VPs she reports to, and supplies them with exactly what they need. I can go on and on about her, but just want to give you a snapshot of the kind of people Musk just laid off. I truly believe everything happens for a reason; when one door closes, many others will open. You are exactly where you need to be, whether you are reading this post, or whether you are one just like Rachel. If you know anyone in your network who is ready to hire, please contact Rachel. I hope this post could lead to new, everlasting friendships and exciting opportunities.  #peoplefirst

My time spent at Lyft were some of the most transformative of my career; sad to see so many talented folks impacted by layoffs this week.

Blindly solving 1000s of Leetcode Challenges is not going to get you a Data Science job,Because Data Science does not always requires Competitive Programming.Here is the problem:Many students and young professionals ask me for random job-referrals without understanding the nature of my job.Instead you should connect with right people who are already doing the job you want, ask meaningful questions, take actionable advice and then reverse engineer it.Ask them these questions:1. What technical and soft skills are required for your job?2. What does your typical day look like?3. How much of the SDE vs ML components do you develop?4. How much of the research component is there? Do you publish it in conferences, blogs, etc.?5. What are the open source projects you refer to?6. What type of problems do you work on?7. Can you suggest any open-source projects I could refer to and learn from?By asking these questions,You will not only get step-by-step directions to pursue a new job,But you will also get a mentor for life!#jobseekers #careeradvice #jobsearch #layoffs

Layoffs THIS WEEK:Twitter 50%Lyft 13%Stripe 14%Opendoor 18%Chime 12%Hootsuite 5%Gem 33%This week has been tough-there's no question. Today was the absolute worst part. The lack of empathy and care with the decisions are layoffs at Twitter are absolutely disgusting to say the least. My heart goes out to everyone! Whether you received the email to your personal email saying you were laid off, or received the email to your work email saying you get to stay....I could not imagine the emotions you're feeling, and my thoughts are with every single one of you.EVERYONE, set boundaries today. Protect your mental health. Unplug from LinkedIn this weekend. Do something that makes you smile and feel good.#layoffs #mentalhealth

My heart and empathy go out to those impacted by the recent layoffs. Take the time you need to see the situation head-on and feel the feels. Then when the time is right, stand up and reach out.  Remember:- it's temporary- be confident in yourself (I know, it's hard to do after such an event) but try!- know your career wins and highlight them- grow your network- you will be rejected at some point - don't get too distracted by itKnow your time will come. I'm rooting for you!#career #network #layoffs

Three companies , same situation- LayoffsThe difference - contrasting leaders and leadership styles 1. Twitter - Rude shock to employees, lack of empathy, no clear communication, more information leaked to media , left wondering if they were one of the unfortunate ones2. Byju‚Äôs - utter display of insensitivity ,  layoffs due to supposed lack of funds, and then in a few days announce collaboration with one of the worlds most expensive sportsperson - ‚ÄúMessi affair‚Äù3. Stripe - empathetic, generous with separation benefits, clear and concise communication to all employees - dignity and respect accordedWhile layoffs are always tough, handle with care. People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel-Maya Angelou#layoffs #leadershipmindset #greatleadership

With multiple layoffs happening in so many tech companies around the globe, it is very important to focus on these skills to ensure you are staying at top of your game during these tough times üéØ Make sure you are taking ownership in your respective roles üéØ Take up projects that are closer to companies priorities and objectives if you get the opportunity. üéØ Constantly showcase your value within the team. One way to do this is doing 2% more than what is expected. Another effective way is by taking up mentoring/volunteering projects to assist with few process steps. üéØ Increase visibility amongst stakeholders, senior executives and leadership. Speak on issues where you think your perspectives could help in the process. Don‚Äôt be quiet during meetings.üéØ Make yourself the kind of employee whom clients want to work with üéØ Have a plan B in case something goes wrong.

Today OneTrust  announced that they are closing their Berlin office, and with that, laying off the whole former Planetly team. This is really sad news - especially since, in my opinion, the people were planetly‚Äôs most valuable asset. I am, therefore, tremendously grateful and proud to have had the opportunity to work with such bright, incredibly passionate and engaged people with the shared ambition to tackle climate change. I‚Äôm safe to say that these past 23 months have been the most fun, inspiring, purposeful but also intense months of my professional life.A special shout-out to my amazing team: true sustainability experts Gabrielƒó Zabelskytƒó, Franziska J√ºde, Tim Palupski, David Horsch, Ammar Nemat  and to Marc Issel  my lead and mentor.

Robert hit on the head. How in the world do you mismanage 3-7+ rounds of funding totaling in the millions if not BILLIONS to the point that you allegedly need to layoff hundreds (or sometimes thousands) of your ‚úåüèævalued employees‚úåüèæ?? Usually these are employees who were hired in the last 6mos & they almost never target anyone in senior leadership positions (who typically make the most money of all your employees).

Like others I‚Äôve been combing through LinkedIn and Twitter today to see the impact of #elonmusktwitter, and it feels truly shitty (for lack of a more professional term) seeing so many talented people get their careers cut short.

As a candidate in this volatile market (and truly any market), it‚Äôs essential to flip the interview around on your potential employer.¬†Here‚Äôs a few questions you all should be asking during the interview process:¬†- How much revenue have you generated and are you profitable?¬†- How many paying customers does the org have?¬†- What's the average contract value?¬†- Dig into their buyers and ideal client profiles.- What are your plans for additional funding?- Get a sense for the founder‚Äôs vision.

Once, a pack of dogs was running behind a man. He feared them, his eyes clearly reflected how dreaded he felt! Apprehensive of being charged at and bitten - he kept running. The pack followed him and finally as he got tired running one of the dogs bit him.In another instance, another pack was running behind a girl. The girl stopped looking at the dogs with a beaming smile, she gently patted. The dogs lost their rage and started playing with the girl!It's the same with our problems and worries, the more we run away, the more they haunt us and finally when we lose our strength to run further we are trapped. On the other hand, those who face challenges head on, tend to get closer to success much faster. This also enables a better mind space and quicker solution-ing!If you're going through a tough phase(read layoffs) and think you're in the midst of a pool of problems try tackling them one at a time. Hope this helps!LinkedIn for Creators #linkedin  #success #problems #problemsolving #layoffs

I have never regretted being an individual contributor except today. Today, I wish I had a few thousand open roles under meSince this morning I have read too many layoff posts...and have a heavy heart full of empathyThe posts by those impacted allude to a deep love for their soon to be ex-employer.  A company that they likely helped build. Posts that talk about lost peers that had become familyI was laid-off from my first job right out of college and have since made tough decisions using the following logic...Double-down on what you love to do; for inspiration on commitment to staying with what you love, spend 4 minutes watching this https://lnkd.in/eHMMwPy9Write a new story. Most laid-off are blessed with decent layoff packages. Below are technology platforms whose skills are in high-demand. Use this time to acquire a new skill. While there are many stories of late bloomers, my favorite on this cold day is about Momofuku Ando, the guy who invented Instant Ramen at age 48.

The Truth.#twitter #twittertakeover #layoffs #elonmusk
-----------------------------
This approach needs to be the standard.Businesses are built like bridges. That bridge is built for your clients/customers as a pathway and solution to their problems. Layoffs are like removing nuts, bolts, and beams. It will place more stress on the other components of the bridge. It may not fail, but it will become uneasy. Eventually, clients and employees will sense the instability and find another bridge. What you and the rest of your leadership team did is a perfect example of doing the right thing.

I was so sad to hear about the #lyft #layoffs. My colleagues at Lyft were some of the most thoughtful, intelligent, and driven people that I've had the privilege to work with.

This... I couldn't imagine being laid off ever, but even more so right before the holidays. Often times I jump on Linkedin and see the news and my heart just breaks. What can I do besides networking with these individuals? Well Bryan Blaha gives some suggestions. Today, i'll leave a recommendation on a few of my connections Linkedin profiles. If you would like me to leave one for you, please feel free to reach out on this post or DM. I know a lot of great individuals who are looking right now, if you have open positions please reach out to those looking for work on Linkedin and let's get them in to organizations that value their skills. SIDE NOTE- A lot of large companies are laying off right now (twitter, stripe, lyft, etc.), but try not to cherry pick from those orgs only. Let's focus on the individual and their skills, not just the org. #layoffs #linkedin #networking

Getting laid off is HARD. I see the news from #Twitter and #Stripe and so many others and I know how difficult it can be. How do I know?Because it‚Äôs happened to me 3 different times. There‚Äôs shame, frustration, confusion, anger, and a host of other emotions that you might not have the language to identify. With that many emotions swirling, it can be difficult to find your way. So, here are a few things that helped me bounce back from a layoff.1. Reach out to your network. This one is tough because you might feel shame or embarrassment but you shouldn‚Äôt. A layoff doesn‚Äôt mean you did something wrong. It also doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt skilled and valuable. Update your LinkedIn profile to #opentowork status and go for it!2. Take advantage of the benefits. If your former employer offers ANY benefits, TAKE THEM. EAP, severance, unemployment, outplacement services etc. Don‚Äôt allow your current disdain for the organization cause you to miss the very things you need at this moment.3. Find/lean into your tribe. Now more than ever you need the love, community, and comfort of the people who care for you. Don‚Äôt stay stuck in the house behind a computer screen hitting ‚Äúapply all‚Äù on a job board. Go to that networking event. Attend that training session that was sent to your email for the 3rd month in a row. You NEED to be around people!If you have been laid off and need someone to help you navigate it, my DMs are open. #layoffs #laidoff #jobchange

In the wake of today‚Äôs #Twitter #layoffs news, I‚Äôm reminded of an insightful Arthur Brooks article in The Atlantic titled ‚ÄúA Profession is Not A Personality‚ÄùWhile it‚Äôs cool to be proud of where you work, it‚Äôs important to ensure that the ‚Äúyou‚Äù outside of the company shines brighter than the ‚Äúyou‚Äù in it.  I have seen the hardest working and most dedicated people get laid off.  I‚Äôve seen people die on their way to work and get replaced in days (true story, and super sad).  I‚Äôve also seen people who left early, took their vacay and never participated in a single ERG or company event move up the ladder because their work was undeniably top notch.Before you were a #Tweep or a Googler or whatever else your company uses to define employees, you were a human.  And you‚Äôll still be one after you leave.In the article, the author asks readers to ask themselves the questions below:Is your job the biggest part of your identity? Is it the way you introduce yourself, or even understand yourself?Do you find yourself sacrificing love relationships for work? Have you forgone romance, friendship, or starting a family because of your career?Do you have trouble imagining being happy if you were to lose your job or career? Does the idea of losing it feel a little like death to you?If you answered affirmatively to any or all of these (2 yrs ago, my answer was yes to nearly all), he invites you to employ two practices can help you reassess your priorities (read the article for more‚Ä¶).Don‚Äôt get me wrong, participating company culture isn‚Äôt a bad thing.  But we shouldn‚Äôt be more proud of where we work than who we are as humans - even if we work somewhere super cool. #career #people #balance #happiness #workculture

Layoffs suck. For people who tie a lot of their self-worth to their job performanceFor people who are single parents or single-income householdsFor people who thought they finally found their dream careerFor people who recently left their dream job to try something newFor people of all experience levels and backgrounds and industriesLayoffs suck.But they are - sometimes - operational necessities.So, leaders, the least you can do is be human about it. Want to know what that looks like? It's less #ElonMusk, more Patrick Collison (CEO of #Stripe). Why? Just read his letter to staff (linked in comments below).Even when tough business decisions have to be made, there is always the option to be human.#PeopleFirst #Culture #Teams #Layoffs #Leadership

During #layoff discussion with an employee - HR/Senior Management - Hey, we will have to let you go due to "company restructuring". It's nothing personal.

Our motto has always been People Are Worth the Investment. That includes if a company is building up it's current team, searching for a new team player or going through a time of restructuring. We are thankful to have had the privilege to work with Darlene H. "I had reached out to Travis at Career Development Partners after my position was eliminated. I had always heard great things about Career Development Partners. This was an amazing experience! I would recommend companies to use this company when restructuring. It will help people so much. I highly recommend if you are needing help as an individual to call them!I want to say thank you Travis! Thank you Career Development Partners!!"Learn more about CDP: https://conta.cc/3NodW4n#careertransition #outplacement #layoffs

With all the layoffs currently happening, this is a good time for some reminders to the ones who are still employed (for now).1) Don‚Äôt use your work email for anything you want access to after your employment ends. Your job could end suddenly, and that email is gone.2) If at all possible, don‚Äôt use your work computer for anything personal. Use your phone or tablet. 3) Use your cellular Internet connection with phone or tablet for personal communications/activities, rather than the company‚Äôs Internet.4) Keep your personal documents on a USB drive, not the company‚Äôs computer.5) If you work from a home office, set up a separate network for work. Keep their laptop isolated from your home network.#callmeifyouneedme #fifonetworks#layoffs #career #jobs #privacy¬†#employment

The most important relationship in life, is the one we have with ourself. It is the seed from which all other relationships are grown. So cultivate it, in both the good and the bad times.  If you recently experienced a job loss, remember this. You are not singular. You are not defined by a job or a title. You are not just a mom or a dad or a caregiver or a writer or dancer or designer or accountant. Who are you? A beautiful and complex human made up of a million big and little pieces, filled with gifts, flaws, dreams and emotions. The words that others (and sometimes we) use to quickly define ourselves, should not be reductive to one piece of us. They are limiting and don't express the true you. Finding the space to discover, to remove the need to over-identify with a particular part of our life is a gift to ourselves and our mental health. It provides strength, perspective and space to simply be. Do the work before the work is needed. Because when we experience loss, we should never lose ourself. Each and every one of us deserves more. Happy Friday. #mentalhealth #fridayvibes #layoffs
-----------------------------
There is so much stigma to the words "laid off" to the employee when there SHOULD be stigma for the employer. You're clearly a business that has gone through hard times.May have mismanaged funds. Couldn't take care of your people!But we all understand that. We understand that things happen and that even the biggest and "most successful" businesses have had to lay people off. TREAT PEOPLE THE SAME WAY! üåüüåüStop treating businesses better than people, my friends. Being laid off is like being punched. It isn't your fault. It happened TO you.Frankly even being fired doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong.And you deserve grace and kindness and HELP, not judgement. I know many recruiters who publicly support people who get laid off, but privately look down on candidates who have been. Let's actually end the stigma. Really awesome people have been laid off. üåéüíïP.S. The Twitter layoffs ARE Musk's fault. Blame him. #kindness #help #layoffs #dobetter

Hearing about layoffs in the tech industry that affect your friends and colleagues is always hard. I would encourage all those affected to take their time to think about their next role and look at what companies align with their values and where opportunities are available for them to achieve their goals!That being said, I recently joined Atlassian and it's been awesome so far. The company is open with no BS, puts customers first, and has an inspiring mission. My team within Confluence is growing, and there are some hard problems that need to be solved for us to help all teams work better together! For those looking for a new role and who are ready to take on their next opportunity, I would encourage you to consider Atlassian and this role!#hiring #team #tech #layoffs #twitter #lyft #stripe

A week‚Äôs notice for a mass layoff is a violation under CA employment law. If you‚Äôre an employee at Twitter or have colleagues there, and you all are impacted by this mass layoff ‚Äî know your rights ‚Äî contact an employment lawyer immediately (they‚Äôre expecting your call). üìö üí¥ ‚ÄúWARN protects employees, their families, and communities by requiring employers to give a 60-day notice to the affected employees and both state and local representatives before a plant closing or mass layoff. Advance notice provides employees and their families time to transition and adjust to the potential loss of employment, time to seek alternative jobs and, if necessary, time to obtain skills training or retraining to successfully compete in the job market.‚Äù(https://lnkd.in/gZ4AbYVM)#employmentlaw #knowyourrights #california #layoffs #warn #leadershipcoaching #executivecoaching

Layoffs by tech companies in recent years are slowly becoming the norm, and are undoubtedly a daunting ordeal for employees facing the chopping block. Having experienced this personally and knowing friends and family who have gone through it, I know how such an incident can affect a person‚Äôs entire outlook on life and work, leading to despair and sometimes even depression. Ultimately, we work our jobs to be paid and to provide for ourselves and our families. Sudden mass layoffs take away a person‚Äôs ability to provide themselves with basic human needs: rent for accomodation, food, and adequate healthcare for themselves and their family, to name a few.#layoffs #cesova Click on the link to read our CEO's take on the current layoffs and hiring freezes happening globally.https://lnkd.in/gxt4xCZ3

The way #Twitter has handled the #layoffs is terrible, to say the least. Frustrating that in 2022 employees are so powerless & giant corporations and billionaires can play with peoples lives in horrible ways. To people whose lives have been impacted by this: you deserve better.

Whenever there are #layoffs, and Twitter is no exception, you can always count on them letting the #DEI #leadership go first. That should tell you how the organization feels about its commitment to #antiracism, #inclusion, and #belonging. (Musk did the same thing at Tesla so it‚Äôs not a surprise.) As James‚Äôs hat says: I doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.

It‚Äôs now been 2 months since I was impacted by the massive rounds of #layoffs at 2U. Seeing more layoffs here on #linkedin and elsewhere in the news is certainly not what anyone wants to see, especially as the holiday season draws closer. To everyone also going through a layoff, I feel for you. I know how hard it is, how you question so many things. It might sound trite to say to stay positive, especially when I know it‚Äôs not always so easy to, but it is important. Better days are ahead. To anyone in my network and beyond, know I am here to help with an introduction, referral, or to vent with, be it over the phone or over a beer.

In an age of specialization, I think we've forgotten the value of versatility.There was a time I worked in fast-food restaurants during high school and college. It was a priority for me to have a flexible work schedule. I was able to enjoy a flexible work schedule in part because I decided to learn every position in the store. No matter what needed to be done, I could do it.From running registers to making sandwiches to stocking shelves and doing dishes. I could open the store in the mornings and close it in the evenings. I worked hard to be the "go to" guy when the store needed someone to work.Working this way meant I could pretty much set my own schedule. Also, if I needed more hours I could just show up and the managers found me work to do because they knew I could handle it.I've carried this behavior into the software industry. I've learned many programming languages, tech stacks, frameworks, etc. I've learned architecture, operations, security, databases, networking, cloud, embedded systems, governance, observability, performance management and other IT industry subject areas. In later years, I've worked to develop finance, management, leadership and strategy skills.In all of this I've been fortunate to have opportunity and environments where I could raise my hand to do something I'd not done before. Luckily, in most places, I had a reputation of swift uptake of whatever I decided to take on.Sometimes the world changes around you in unpredictable ways. The world's appetite for specializations change. It seems advantageous for us to be ready to change with it. I learned this again when I went through a phase of layoffs mid-career. I think that continuous curiosity lends itself to a rich set of experiential learning that creates value as a whole being greater than the sum of its parts. I see this as a value creating behavior that can sustain in times of change and uncertainty.We can always learn new things and put them to use. #curiousity#adaptability#layoffs #agilemindset

Had to repost this since I got laid off alongside more than half of the team in my previous company about a month ago and this motivated me. So far I've had no luck but I won't give up.It has really felt unfair since there was no performance issue and it was out of the blue but it really taught me to be ready for anything.
-----------------------------
My LinkedIn wall is flooded with posts about this week's #layoffs. üíîLayoffs are terrible. Especially when executed poorly, they can be really traumatic. Feeling for everyone impacted by these as your life turned upside down out of the blue. Please take some time to recover. üîã And whenever ready, just putting Virtual Internships on your radar. We are a remote-first edtech startup with team members in 30+ countries. Great culture and wonderful people.We are hiring across teams, and all the open roles are here: https://lnkd.in/eN4N2FQh. P.S. If you are a people professional and have dealt with layoffs in your company, feel free to reach out for support. üôè We should be here for each other, especially during these months that are challenging all of us incredibly.

As we continue to see more and more companies go through layoffs, RIF's, etc., I want to suggest to anyone impacted, this is not the end of your journey.This is a bump in the road.A door that needed to close so a better one can open.You worked for one of these well known companies for a reason.Because you are bad ass at what you do.Not to get all spiritual or anything, but I am a big believer in timing (i.e. things typically happen the way they're supposed to, when they're supposed to).You'd be amazed how many of these opportunities have provided folks a chance to reset.And in many cases, completely pivot to put their focus where their passions truly lie.I have been in recruiting for 19 years now.I've helped over 600 folks find jobs, and I've talked to 1000's upon 1000's more about their career interests, backgrounds, motivators, etc.If I can offer any advice in these uncertain times, try and take a few days and just completely unwind from technology.Like, put your computer completely away.Get off LinkedIn, FB, IG, TikTok, whatever else folks are on nowadays, and just chill.Yes, I understand there are bills to pay and people to provide for.But a few days away from your computer likely won't sway that too much one way or the other.Today is a Friday, a perfect time to shut it down for the weekend and come back to it on Monday.Feel free to put out to your network that you've been impacted first.This way anyone who sees your message can start networking on your behalf while you're away.But then do yourself (and your family, friends, whomever you keep in your inner circle) a favor, and find a way to recharge.They still support you.They still love you.None of this defines who you are as a person.This is an event.Nothing more.You've got this.You will get through this!#layoff #layoffs #layoffsandjobreductions

It's been a rough week in tech...sad to see layoffs happening all around üíî.The Companies are just cutting down the workforce or doing layoff in such a rapid way. They are doing it in their own favour.But they are not thinking¬†about few points üëá a) Employees need to maintain their financial situations according to what they earn for their well beings, future etc.b) Interviewing Candidates who are preparing harder for getting job for several years specially freshers.They need to give atleast some period of time if they are making any such decision so that one can look for other roles for employees.Same with candidates who are in process of hiring with a company for several month. They are just cancelling interviews and rejecting without any feedback or informing about proper reason. This is kind of disciplinary action. I would also request everyone to post any job openings that they might have. #recruiters #hiringmanagers #hiringfreshers #hiring #developers #sdejobs #TweepsLet's come together and support each other. ü§ù Twitter BYJU'S Stripe #tech¬†#techlayoffs¬†#layoffs¬†#opportunites

Elon Musk fires almost all of India‚Äôs staffü§Øüê¶ After the completion of the $44 billion deal last week, Musk fired top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal along with legal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to a WS] report.üê¶Several top executives including CMO Leslie Berland also left the company after the firing of top executives.üê¶The company had nearly 250 employees in India.Twitter employees globally received an email at around 4am IST on 4 November, informing them that they will lose access to Twitter's internal systems, like Slack, emails etc., if their role is impacted by the downsizing.üê¶The first round of layoffs at Twitter started Friday following a formal email sent by the company on Thursday that reportedly asked workers across the globe to stay at home and wait for another email that will update them about the status of their job.üê¶Further, sources confirmed that people from Twitter's Curation team, which curates content for the Twitter Moments feature, have been let go. üê¶Other teams affected include Communications, Global Content Partnerships, Sales and Ad Revenue, Engineering and Product. All or at least 50% of employees in these teams have been let go.üê¶An ex-employee, who was among the ones laid off, said that some contractual employees who weren't on full time company rolls have also been retained.Follow Sagar Bandodkar for more üíπ#twitter #job #people #india #elonmusk #layoffs #finance

I know that more and more #layoffs are occurring. I wanted to take a moment to say, stay positive! Yes it hurts to have a job one moment and not have one a moment later. #connect with the LinkedIn community. Reach out to old connections and make new ones. Redefine what you are looking for. As for me, I decided it was time to find a company that had the same goals as me. Building a #bestinclass centralized Talent Acquisition department is high on my list. I can say that I have interviewed with some companies that I was not interested in working for them. Today, I interviewed with a company and I am throughly excited for the next steps in the #interview process. #reach  for the stars, #pray for guidance and above all:Stay #positive and #active !!

The tech #layoffs at Twitter and Stripe are brutal. However, more clients like this one are using Gigged.AI to hire on-demand tech talent like Cloud Engineers, Data Engineers and Software Developers. We expect over ¬£1m of new gigs in next few months. If you have been affected create a profile and join the community of over 10K tech freelancers to be matched to a new project. Harvey Rose is on hand for a chat to walk through how it works and give you access to the community!

Thinking a lot about the turmoil and drastic culture change that just happened at Twitter and sending love to all employees--those being laid off and those left behind wondering what's next. The "Come for the purpose, stay for the people" message is really striking right now in contrast to the new CEO's attitude and actions. Best of luck to all going through the muck right now. Take time to react, process and then start dreaming again. Let "What's next" be a good thing and go for what you truly want. #Twitter #humancapital (it's not really a human term is it?)#workplaceculture #layoffs
-----------------------------
It is a nightmare for my friends who just got fired from Twitter! I heard stories of people consoling each other through #slack before their internal access was revoked. Many people's dream right from college is to get a MAANG job but the reality is different in today's economy. All the giants are struggling with the economic recession which will indirectly affect small companies in the upcoming days. Let's all be ready to face whatever it is! Let's upskill ourselves!Let's face it all together!P.S. If anyone in my network lost their job due to massive firing, please feel free to reach out. I can help my level best to refer you to the recruiters in my network. #AllLove#recession #layoffs #recruiters #economy #job #network #help

Email me at Katie@compassionateleadership.co and I will do them in the order received.It‚Äôs frustrating to fight for a more compassionate world of work for all & then to watch leaders like Elon Musk treat people so terribly during an extremely traumatic time. Not only are they losing their jobs, they‚Äôre losing their jobs with a microscope on them and media frenzy surrounding the company.  Closure is so important in these transitions so I feel for those who will be seeing reminders of Twitter for months to come. ü§çI am grateful to not be working right now by choice for health reasons, so I‚Äôd like to pay if forward as much as I can.

I'm basically going to repost what I posted a couple of weeks ago verbatim. I've had the misfortune to be laid off twice this year since June. (And yes, I am looking and remain optimistic that there is a great fit for me out there). But layoffs continue apace as the economy continues to struggle, especially in the tech sector. So...here once again is a relatively popular post I made about layoffs based off a couple of articles I wrote for TeamBlind. ------Some advice for all my friends out there. It's a rough time. Layoffs are happening everywhere, including to me. I recently wrote a series of articles about layoffs and some of the ways to prepare and handle them and I thought I'd share with my network in case they turn out to be useful. For those of you who have been through this kind of time before, the advice will be pretty straightforward but, hopefully, there will still be something in there that can help you.First off, for some of my friends more recently in the job market, it is important to differentiate between a layoff and being fired. I've heard some people describe a layoff as being fired and that is both an unhelpful mindset to get into but also not true. Legally the two are actually very different and potential employers treat them differently. So here's how to tell the difference between a layoff and being fired and why it is important.https://lnkd.in/gqPGZNFcNext up is what to do about it. There are some steps you can take before and during a layoff that can help make your situation a little better.https://lnkd.in/gGF2BCv7I hope these two articles help someone out. And if you have any open roles that I might be a good fit for, please let me know!#laidoff¬†#layoffs

#layoffs suck no matter what. But when I see large layoffs right before the holidays it really makes my insides cringe. There are many companies on a #hiringfreeze  right now, and many others that have filled their 2022 headcount and won‚Äôt be #hiring until next year some time.¬†My advice to those affected‚Äì don‚Äôt let that deter you!! You should absolutely #apply to positions through the holiday season- if for no other reason than the fact that you‚Äôll have less competition [many folks take a break from job searching during the holiday season]. Make connections with hiring leaders and follow their posts; make yourself visible by commenting on their threads.¬†#follow companies you are interested in to stay up to date on what's going on with them.Cruise is hiring NOW.

With all the tension in the air, I've debated on chiming in on the recent layoffs happening at Twitter, Stripe, Lyft and so many others. To me, it feels like there's a divide when these things happen. Of "haves" and "have nots"‚Äìand the easy route is to watch through the window, frozen with disbelief. In psychology, they call this the diffusion of responsibility: When people who need to make a decision wait for someone else to act instead. The more people involved, the more likely it is that each person will do nothing, believing someone else from the group will probably respond. When I think about "real life" and how I would respond to someone in trouble or in need of help, I know exactly what I would do. I realize this should be no different. So if you or anyone you know have been affected by the layoffs, ClickUp is hiring! Please take a look at our careers page, we have several openings and would love to hire these talented folks.Comment, tag or share for reach. üí¨Heck, comment if your company is hiring too! ü§ùLet's be brave, step in and try to make a difference.

Worried about layoffs and terminations? Know your rights and fight back illegal terminations."Especially in mass downsizing cases, such as that in Oracle ‚Äî if the employees refuse to resign, the company will be left with no option but to continue with them on board because there is no legal procedure for mass terminations!"#unionstrong #layoffs #AIITEU
-----------------------------
Layoffs have been a hot topic of late - particularly tech layoffs. And one of the things people say to you when you're laid off is ... "this could be the best thing that ever happened to you." In fairness, it can be. Actually, it happened to me once and it was. Totally opened a new career path for me. BUT, it also can be heartbreaking, devastating and even debilitating for some. So, if you have a friend that has been laid off, CHECK IN. Don't assume they are OK or worry about making them feel weird. Check in early and often. Offer any job search help or ideas that you can. Some people get very embarrassed about being laid off even though none of it is their fault. Let them know this doesn't define them or reflect on them in any way. #layoffs #corporations #tech
-----------------------------
It's really astounding to see how the social media universe works...While all of the negative emotions are being amplified with all the news of #layoffsA consequence of that is the increased virality of #linkedinAnd there is an article on the curated LinkedIn #news that is headlined:"Canada's jobs boom beats estimates"LinkedIn - Is it feasible to have a feature request to measure the success of #opentowork posts by those that are laid off by capturing their time to find their next Job?We are displaying vanity badges of # of engagement on our posts, and "LinkedIn" helped me get this Job.It would be good to measure the impact of the posts specifically looking for jobs by:1. When the individual has their next role updated on LinkedIn2. The time to get the job since the #opentowork post3. The number of roles that are true "LinkedIn Helped them to get the next Job"Instead of the engagement metrics based on comments and reactions.#RnD
-----------------------------
Logging in to see the massive amount of layoffs continue to pile up including Twitter is so heartbreaking!I've been there and wholeheartedly understand the rush of emotions and thoughts that follow after receiving such news. My heart goes out to everyone and I sincerely wish you all the best on your new journey and career search. If you're open to contract work, I highly recommend looking into opportunities as they tend to pay pretty decent and offer similar benefits etc. possibly become more of a flexible working experience for some. This is based off my own personal experiences. A couple great agencies I had the pleasure of working with is DISYS and Kforce Inc. #layoffs #bigtech #opentowork #hiring #twitter #stripe #contracting

It's been really hard to see all of the ongoing layoffs in the tech industry. So many hardworking people's livelihoods are on the line, and unfortunately I know many who have been suddenly laid off. If there's anything I can do to help, please ping me. A reference, a LinkedIn endorsement, or a connection to someone in my network....just let me know. We're still hiring for #softwareengineering positions here at Google. I focus on Embedded/Firmware, Android, genSWE with Android and Computer Vision roles. A lot of startups seem to be hiring and poaching the talent lost from big tech. So it seems like a good time to focus on startup companies too. #google #hiring #layoffs #tech #startup #linkedin #reference #talent

Chime has cut about 12% of its 1300-staff members. It was the first in a round of layoffs done by both public and private tech startups this week. (Lyft, OpenDoor, Stripe, etc). Why did so many land in the last couple days? In conversations I had, was told: - There are few weeks before the end of the year that aren't holidays- A rush of news means that the cuts aren't their own headline. Public companies often make cuts in the run up to earnings - private companies can escape heat by announcing at the same time. - Still early enough in Q4 that cuts would be reflected in Q4 earnings. I'm looking to learn more about how layoffs are being communicated to employees, what severance packages look like and how employees are thinking about preparing for cuts, if more decide to follow Stripe's lead (of both cuts + how they communicated the news to employees). Also, to learn more about why these cuts are happening *now*, in contrast to the broader U.S. job market.

Ok Folks - I've been getting lots of messages asking what I did to find another job 6 weeks after my own layoff experience - I'll tell you what I did, and what I didn't do - What I did - 1. Allowed myself to feel the feelings - a layoff leaves you feeling gutted - when you know you gave it your all, and left nothing on the table, it's just hard. 2. Cleaned everything, organized my pantry, pulled out the fridge and stove, cleaned behind it (gross) switched out closets for fall/winter clothes. All of the domestic godess tasks I never got to.3. Binged Netflix - yep, I did - 4 full days.4. Got on #LinkedIn and applied to literally every job I even thought I might be able to do using easyapply (this doesn't work)5. Decided to grow my network6. Cried7. Felt discouraged8. Doubted myself and my skillset that I worked incredibly hard to build.9. Let my hubs send me to the salon to get my nails done when all I wanted to do was sit home and pout.10. Got out of my funk - reached out for references, reference letters, called my work buds who had gotten laid off since to encourage them, updated my resume, started applying on company websites, tailored my resume as needed for each position, started working on free training materials, started following leaders on LinkedIn, engaging with posts, posting some of my own (most of which have ended up in the land of nowhere, with the tumbleweeds, but that's ok!)11. Got REAL honest with myself, reviewed my skills and found where I could improve12. Bombed a couple of interviews - I hadn't done an interview in YEARS and man...but each one prepared me to be better for the next one.13. Prayed - when the layoff happened, just floored, gutted, and taken by surprise- someone told me - "There is one person who was not surprised by this...God. He has a plan." I carried this with me through the battle.14. Cuddled with my littles - made cookies, carved pumpkins for halloween, watched lots of (age appropriate) scary movies, took family time, made more casseroles for dinner than I have in the entire rest of my life combined (I'm now a casserole queen btw)What I did NOT do - 1. Pay someone to redo my resume (not that I wouldn't have, if I hadn't been laid off and had an extra $400 laying around)2. Continue applying willy nilly to everything that popped up3. Allow myself to give up4. Change industries - I worked HARD to get into IT, and I determined that I was NOT going to leave5. Never stopped. One foot in front of the other, kept pushing.I know that there are SO many people out there who have since been laid off as well50% of¬†#Twitter¬†(starting today)13% of¬†#Lyft14% of¬†#Stripe18% of¬†#Opendoor12% of¬†#Chime5% of¬†#Hootsuite¬†(2nd round)33% of¬†#GemI feel your pain.

Don't cut culture in the pursuit of cutting costs.Measure twice cut once is the adage. But as we are all reading about disappointing earning in the tech sector triggering mass layoffs and hiring freezes, executive teams are demanding and implementing broad cost cutting measures in the face of these wavering financial markets and the certainty of a tricky economic year ahead.¬†I get it. HR teams are forced to cut costs¬†and I empathize with both employers and employees in this world. It's tough, especially after a pandemic that rocked us all.But, consider this - that if you're freezing funds to hire, you should be doubling down and reassessing your cultural¬†investments to authentically engage¬†and retain your current workforce.Here are my suggestions:-Re-examine your benefits: Many employers aren't actually listening or measuring engagement use with benefits that will make a difference in their employees' wellbeing. And this is EXPENSIVE...Have you recently ASKED what matters to your people?-Double down on training your management¬†team to ask this in a way that matters: Here's an interesting story. We work with¬†a huge healthcare system where managers asked their nurses if they were engaging with their EAP.¬†The nurses' response? "EAP? I don't even have time to go to the bathroom!" (Maybe we need to start with better listening and scheduling bio breaks?)When you don't empower your managers to have conversations that¬†connect with where your employees really are and what they struggle with, you are setting yourself and your teams up to fail.-Assess "talk/walk" gaps: A talk/walk gap is when senior management says, "We believe this, and this is important," and in reality, structures and rules don't support that. Let's use the "talk" example of "We believe in flexibility and work/life balance," and the reality of "Management sends email at 10 o'clock at night." If you go through a talk/walk gap identification with your team, you can all agree that emails won't be sent that late OR that people don't need to respond until the next morning. You'd be amazed at what the talk/walk exercise reveals.Remember, cost-cutting does NOT have to come at the expense of culture. Investment in your people is THE thing that will set you up for long-term profitability, even in the face of short-term financial hardship.¬†¬†#culture #wellbeing #layoffs # #management

I have been seeing so many posts about layoffs lately. Unfortunately, some of those layoffs are close to home and not from big companies that have been mentioned (Lyft, Stripe, Twitter, etc). My quick advice as someone who has been in that same place years ago?1. This is the best time to explore new industries you‚Äôve been curious about and learn. Study the markets and make strategic decisions about where you‚Äôd like to go next.¬†2. Loving the industry you‚Äôre currently in? This is also the best time to continue learning and strengthen your knowledge in it! Been slacking on renewing your certification? Now‚Äôs the perfect time to recertify.¬†3. Reach out to old contacts, not only in a LinkedIn networking sense but also old friends. Sometimes our career gets in the way of our relationships and this could be the catch-up you needed. Also‚Ä¶ You never know if they could be the next introduction to your future employer.4. Look for jobs where you are appreciated. While yes, it‚Äôs very stressful, this also may be a blessing in disguise that will take you one step further in your career.¬†5. For those who have survived company layoffs, but thinking you might be next, please stay diligent! Spruce up your resume/portfolio and save money where you can.¬†Layoffs are tough and absolutely exhausting, my heart is with you. But at the same time, I believe in you. üíõ You know what they say... when one door closes, another opens.--#career #networking #learning #future #layoffs

It‚Äôs simply heartless to lay off people before the holidays. Save your apologies. Your lack of planning, understanding  and empathy as well as your lack of  having a strategy for a trying economy have put entire families at risk. Did you take a pay cut? Are you still planning to send fancy gifts üéÅ to your investors?Do better.  The methods in which people are getting booted is demoralizing as well. Be the leader that‚Äôs in your corporate bio and LinkedIn profile. That‚Äôs the post. #layoffs #realitycheck #professionalism #planning #rif #people #strategy #maresaidit #holidayseason2022 Just be kind!

Layoffs/Retrenchments are difficult things. They might be necessary but they must be done right.I've been speaking to candidates and MANY have had NO warning. That's just not fair. Employers forget a career is like a relationship. You nurture someoneYou give feedback You have up and down momentsYou share moments of growth togetherThe last thing anyone would like in a relationship is to be DUMPED overnight. Breakups happen. I get it. But breakups can be classy and amicable. You can talk things out or drop hints. Not lead others and suddenly devastate their lives and their families' lives.There are many candidates holding up a strong front now. I admire their courage. I don't think I could be that strong if it was me. I might be in a unique position to help. Reach out to me if you've been affected. If I don't have the roles, I'll refer you to people who might or give you advice/negotiation tips, etc. The media likes to sensationalize quiet quitting, the great resignation, etc. This quiet firing is the real booboo here that needs to be covered. #career #share #help #quietquitting #quietfiring #hiring #hiringnow #retrenchment #fire #layoffs #layoff #recession #fairness #fair #devastated #relationship #courage #dumped #tech

October saw the highest number of #jobcuts announced in a single month since February 2021 when 34,531 job cuts were recorded. It is the sixth time this year that cuts were higher in 2022 than in the corresponding month a year earlier.¬†‚ÄúWe are beginning to see more job cut activity in the fourth quarter, historically when the bulk of cuts occur, as companies finalize budgets and plans. Many companies are anticipating a downturn, and with a still-tight labor market and the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes, more cuts will be on the way as we enter 2023,‚Äù said Andrew Challenger.https://lnkd.in/gpK7A646#ChallengerReport #layoffs #q4 #labormarket #economy #economicdownturn

If there was any question that we‚Äôre living in Dickensian times, two communications this week should put that to rest.‚ÄúIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way‚Äîin short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.‚Äù¬†‚Äî Charles Dickens, 1859I‚Äôm referring to the letters that went out to employees at Twitter and Stripe, who both had significant layoffs ‚Äî Stripe letting go of 14 percent of its staff and Twitter getting rid of about half of its employees. Layoffs are never easy. They‚Äôre not easy for the leaders who need to make the decision ‚Äî because typically it‚Äôs the last resort for most companies ‚Äî nor are they easy for those whose lives are upended, with uncertain futures in uncertain times.¬†The two communications about these layoffs couldn‚Äôt be further apart in their styles and approach. And they say a great deal about the leaders running these companies.#leadership #communication #layoffs #twitter #stripe

"Layoffs are subject to the offered agreement with which the employee has agreed upon." YES, we get it! üò°But, this Bullshit happening at Twitter, Stripe, Lyft, Opendoor, Chime, Morgan Stanly, Byjus, etc are completely unethical and inadmissible. To be honest, there isn't much that we as employees can do to stop the layoffs, but it is so amazing to see how the community is developing and supporting one another. It is so heartwarming.‚ù§We should also not forget, with these kinds of occurrences, we continue to grow and get better every day. There was never a community that was so openly mined and helping individuals back in the late 2000s.Employers need to be aware that firing someone unexpectedly is similar to chopping off a flowering plant. It will affect him as well as his surroundings and family.Furthermore, employees should be careful to choose a company that values both their lives and their skills. Also, please don't base any decisions just on your monthly salary alone.More power to people who got laid off in the past 48 hours, keep pushing! ‚ù§#community #people #layoffs #power #twitter #stripe #byjus #like #India #work #Opendoor #MorganStanly #love #support #jobs #hiring #tech

Imagine if #elonmusk was apart of a #mergersandacquisitions hunt for a #cannabis brand? How would the public perceive it? #layoffs aside because that's already happening heavily in this industry, would he be much better than if #jeffbezos had free prime delivery with the purchase of an eighth or more over $50? The #cannabisindustry is at a critical point right now. The cashflow has slowed and major #celebrities have become the main attraction.How does that REALLY help the industry? i applaud Cresco Labs and Columbia Care for being a part of a bigger moment than just  #diddy now owning a huge chunk of reality in the #mso space. What this means to me is that now more than ever there is a put up or shut up moment. Will this REALLY help increase #inclusivity  and #diversity ? How will this #aquisition help the brand? Will the #quality be there? Will the #marketing  and #branding  be as on point as the companies that aim to the #cannabisculture? all this is yet to be seen. This move could be critical for #socialequity in the industry. On the celebrity side, if this works out with Diddy then i really wouldn't be surprised if #elon looks to add to his portfolio¬†#elonmusktwitter #corporate #cannabiscommunity #cannabisbusiness
