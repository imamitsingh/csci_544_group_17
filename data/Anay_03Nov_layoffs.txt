It's been an incredible ride, and I will always think fondly of my time at Stripe! Very sad to share that I am affected by this round of layoffs, and while I plot/ponder my next move, I am more than happy to help any others who are in a similar position. Despite this painful experience, I still believe the future of fintech is bright, and that incredible innovation is possible during times of challenges like these. #stripelayoffs #layoffs

Tough day for tech today; I was unfortunately a part of the layoffs at Stripe. I had a short stint in my role but very much enjoyed my time.I will be taking the next couple of weeks to prepare for, and research new opportunities as we approach 2023.That being said, I am open to networking regarding backend developer roles for cloud computing services, fintech or a new domain.#layoffs #opentowork

Hard to see the continuous layoffs and threat to jobs during an already turbulent time!If anyone needs any help or advice on LinkedIn profiles, resumes or interviews, please reach out and I’ll help where I can. #layoffs #redundancy
-----------------------------
Sharing with my network for further reach. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Hanna since I started at Stripe. She’s an exceptional recruiter and would be a great addition to any company!
-----------------------------
While #layoffs are really sucky, I have way more admiration than I already had for Stripe and their leaders today with how they respectfully handled the news. In a tough economy and hard time, they were able to think about multiple layers of human needs, not just cash severance. There was the mention of the world at large, what this means for Stripe's business, and look ahead into 2023. Outside of just cash severance, they included immigration support, 6 months of healthcare equivalent costs, career support and accelerated vesting (since people join startups for potential). Going further than January 2023 allows people to not have to stress and scramble heading into the holidays, which is the slowest hiring time anyways. As always, if there's anything that I can do so support, please reach out.

Today is a very tough day! Like many of my very talented colleagues, my role was unfortunately impacted by layoffs at #stripe. I truly cannot begin to express how grateful I am for the opportunity to have worked with such empathic, inspiring and passionate people!

If you or anyone you know is in need of a #recruiter, please reach out! My heart goes out to each person impacted, and I'm hopeful we can get through this together and come out stronger!#layoffs #recruiting #opentowork

Please reach out to John if you have any Sourcing or Recruiting opportunities.

During Product management Interviews I realized that the more authentic I was with what I had truly done versus what the interviewing committee wanted to know about my experience was not aligning well and this led to me doubting the entire experience I had gathered over the many many years working in multiple roles and finally ending up and loving the role of product manager (P.S. Majority of people find their way into product management instead of starting as one straight out of college).So, Here is my attempt at sharing the journey of how I began interviewing, got rejected , felt dejected, Got impacted by a layoff , felt it was time to identify the areas of improvements, took a bootcamp and felt empowered to sign up for the  job that provided me most strategic opportunities to grow. First and foremost blessed to call my partner my best friend and biggest cheerleader one could possibly ask for, Thank you Sagar Jha ⭐️Shout out to Vijay Venugopal , Angela Hooper, Adam Weinstein, Erica Lockheimer, Alyne P. for being the most wonderful mentors and guides a recently layoff impacted person could ask for. Your advices, referrals and words of support meant more to me than they could possibly know ❤️Shout out to Diego Granados for creating a wonderful community and platform to become better at interviewing for product management role , The bootcamp was game changer for me 💰Blessed to be a part of absolutely amazing University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business community who were relentless in helping me with the resume and interview preparation and just providing a great sense of community 🏆Thank you Hira Labeeb for believing in me and advocating for me 😊And I hold extreme regards and gratitude for all the people who checked in with me via various mediums of communication and offered referrals, words of encouragement and help in last 2 months 😍#productmanagement #layoffs #tech #interviewpreparation

Yesterday, 12% of amazing Chimers and myself were part of the Chime layoffs. I joined Chime almost 3 years ago as one of the first few hires in the Chicago office. I've worked with incredible people during my time there and I would not change a moment of it. Rockstars, all of you.Thank you Dakota Betts who reached out & convinced me to join Chime - you’ll never know how much everything changed from a simple LinkedIn message. Thank you to my managers who always supported, listened, and helped me grow into my roles: Jennifer Hillard, MSOD, Adrianne Manhart-Hickey, & Sarah May. Jennifer Hillard, MSOD, thanks for trusting & giving me a chance to grow out the Early Talent program alongside you.Shout out to my first friend & partner in crime at Chime, Evan Mikos. Thanks for making it fun and always pinging me when there was candy in the kitchen.I'd be incredibly grateful for any leads on recruiting opportunities - especially in Early Talent/University Recruiting. Give me a shout if you know anyone within these spaces! To all of the 12%, I can wait to see the “I’m proud to announce that I’ve accepted..” post come up on my channel for you. #opentowork #recruiting #layoffs #opportunities #jobsearch #chime

Unfortunately, I too was a part of today's layoffs at Stripe. Thanks to all my teammates and coworkers at Stripe that made working there a really wonderful experience. I hope to keep in touch with many of you in the coming days.This has all been very sudden so I am still processing, but I will be looking into opportunities as a Full Stack Engineer after a few weeks of rest & brushing up on system design haha 🙃. If anyone knows of any opportunities, especially in the privacy space, please don't hesitate to reach out then!#layoffs #opentowork #stripe #engineering
-----------------------------
Layoffs are always difficult and hard to handle well. No leader looks forward to them. That said, Stripe did a good job. The founders were transparent and took responsibility for mistakes. They were also thorough and mindful on how to minimize the impact of those affected. They talked about what they were going to different going forward. I hope more companies will adopt Stripe’s approach to communicating the change and how they treated those departing the company. Link to the founders letter in the comments. #founders #leader #layoffs

Today is a tough day. Like many others, my role was unfortunately impacted by the #layoffs at #stripe. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such great people, and my heart goes out to each person impacted.While I'm still processing this information, I am optimistic and excited for whats next. I joined Stripe in the #recruiting space, but was fortunate to go on rotation as an #executiveassistant the last few months to two brilliant executives at Stripe: the Head of Web Presence and Head of User Research. If you know anyone who is hiring in those spaces, please reach out! #OpenToWork

Not sure who needs this, but if you were amongst those experiencing layoffs, my private messages are open. Willing to help bridge the gap and pass along any resources to anyone during these tough times.Community is so important at this point. Sending positive vibes to those impacted. ❤️ #community #layoffs #corporatelife

It was an incredible journey, but I was also one of the many #Chimers who were impacted by layoffs yesterday. I am truly grateful for the opportunity and experience. Chime is an amazing company with an inspiring mission. I felt a great sense of purpose coming to work each day knowing we were making an impact on people's financial well being.Thank you to the leaders who motivated, challenged and inspired me. Thank you to the my colleagues and peers who helped "Simplify" and "Make it Happen". To the team I left behind.... continue to build awesome things and do great work. I am extremely grateful for the time we got to spend together.For the other #Chimers (or any other company for that matter) who have been impacted by layoffs.. my thoughts are with you and your families. These are incredibly challenging times, but keep your head up. We will all get through this. There are lots of reasons to be optimistic! If there's any help I can offer, please feel free to reach out.If you or anyone you know is aware of opportunities for a technology leader focused on Customer Services & Experience (CX) systems please do let me know... I am #opentowork #thankyou #layoffs #chime

Reading about these layoffs has my heart broken 💔  Being impacted by one earlier this year, I can sympathize. For a lot of people in tech, a part of their passion and identity is the work they do for their company [and yes, many of us are guilty of working more than 40hr a week!]. For those who have trouble removing themselves, their identity from work these reminders are for you:-You are not your job- your job is an aspect of who you are but your worth is much much more -It's okay to not feel okay- as silly as it may sound we sometimes live in a world of toxic positivity. While you may not feel amazing today or even tomorrow- I can promise you will not feel this way forever-You deserve to take care of yourself! Self care comes in many shapes and forms; Mental, Emotional, Spiritual, Social, Physical, Practical, etc. Focus on what YOU need at this point in time. Some people will be quick to jump into the practical side and find their next role while others may take a bit more time to do some soul finding and take a break. Whichever type you choose, there is no wrong answer.-It's okay to ask for help- the easier said then done phrase that personally keeps me awake at night. If you are reaching out to family, friends, mentors, LI connections, or just the LI community- we are here for you!  If you see any roles at DoorDash that could be interesting to you or just interesting in networking, please message me. I would love to help in finding your next adventure#layoffs #layoff #stripe #lyft #opendoor #netflix #zillow #compass #wearehiring #doordash #community

I have been a huge follower of Stripe since I have heard about it. They are doing some great work when it comes to payment processing and you can clearly see it in their growth. However this saddens me as how it will impact so many people. Also more, it paints a long term glum picture about the upcoming economy. Definitely some worrying times ahead. Best wishes to the impacted group of people who is going through this journey.#economy #people #stripe #layoffs

#jobseekers don't let your valuable LinkedIn real estate go to waste! Your headline is at the top of your profile and the perfect place to sell yourself in just a few words.Example for an Executive Assistant: You *could* have your header just say, "Executive Assistant". 😿 Or, you could have it say, "Executive Assistant who is a supportive force that empowers senior leadership". 🔥 #greenbannergang #opentowork#techlayoffs#layoffs#linkedin

Unwarranted optimism. Proactive service recovery overriding strategy. “A year of reckoning.” Forrester’s predictions for the world customer experience leaders will face in 2023 couldn’t be clearer – or more dire.Based a report developed by the market research firm’s customer experience (CX) analysts that was shared with 360 Magazine, Forrester said it expects that one in five CX programs will disappear next year. This will be largely due to a failure to demonstrate business value, the report suggested, as well as the impact of ongoing economic uncertainty and other headwinds facing many brands.I gathered feedback and advice from people like Brooks Bell's  Suzi Paugh Tripp, Mark Kilens of Airmeet and Israel Gaudette for this week's top story. #cx #budgets #layoffs

Tech layoffs are on the rise as companies aim to restructure their business strategies. In an era built around tech, having adequate employees plays a large role in pushing innovation into the era. It will be interesting to see how these layoffs will affect the economy and the well-being of the tech industry. #Tech #Layoffs #Business

Today I was sad to learn that I was one of many people who were affected by Stripe's recent round of layoffs. Although my time at Stripe came to an end sooner than I would have liked, I'm incredibly grateful for my experience here and proud of what I've been able to accomplish over the past year. It's been a blast and I've learned a lot! To my Specialized Recruiting teammates and the Security organization - thank you for being amazing partners. I've enjoyed every moment working with you. I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason and am excited to see what's in store for me in the future. I've been contemplating spinning up a consulting business for a long time, and will probably give that a try! In the meantime, I'm looking forward to taking a few weeks off to reset & recharge before launching into something new.Big hugs to my fellow recruiters and everyone else at Stripe who's having a difficult day today. #stripe #layoffs

It’s hard to put into words what I’m feeling today, so I’ll just say that my heart feels heavy. Really, really heavy. Today Stripe announced a reduction of 14% and many of those who were impacted I had the pleasure of working with. Stripe is known for having an incredibly high talent bar and all of these individuals exemplify this principle. I’m not exaggerating when I say that some of the most talented people I’ve ever worked with I met at Stripe. If you are hiring, especially for Recruiters, Sourcers, or Recruiting Coordinators, please let me know as I’d love to make introductions. #stripe #layoffs #recruiting

The Pickling ProcessQ: Can you get PTSD from a job?A: As someone who has experienced multiple forms of PTSD, I can tell you that you can get PTSD from a terrible work experience. I have dealt with PTSD from my time in the military. I have also dealt with PTSD after a tragic car accident. Lastly, I have experienced some form of PTSD from a toxic work environment as well as two back to back layoffs. I have been on several interviews with companies in the last month and have been in some terrible interviews. On the other hand, I have been on a few interviews where it’s been easy and conversational. Those are the best and those are the companies that you want to join.I have some advice for hiring managers and recruiters. Please take it easy on your interviewees/candidates. You don’t know what they’ve been through. Layoffs are happening by the minute and for most people, this is their first layoff. Plus this is detrimental to their well-being and mentality. If a candidate sends a note to the recruiter after a bad interview, I think you should give them another chance. Set up another meeting or find a way to let that candidate shine. We are all different and express our skills in different ways. Please respect and treat your candidates like people.View more of The Pickling Process on my website:https://lnkd.in/gxHi5Ny6#layoffs #inspiration #hiringmanagers #designleadership Design Leadership Forum UX Jobs #recruiting

When Microsoft - a well-managed firm that is future-focused - announces layoffs, that's not good news.

Who cares about Twitter employees? So what if they get laid off.   🤷‍♀️ Many of them are content moderators anyway.  I’m truly disgusted as those are just a spattering of comments I’ve seen on posts about Twitter. Humanity at its finest I guess. When layoffs happen people lose jobs.PEOPLE. With bills to pay. Mouths to feed. Dreams to build. Responsibilities to care for. I understand layoffs are part of business. I’ve been laid off twice in my career. I understand CEO’s care about bottom line and revenue and growth. I’m not naive and I don’t need to be schooled. So… please save it. I also understand Elon Musk has millions ofLittle minion disciples who applaud his every word and move. That’s great. He’s successful. He’s a businessman. He’s the CEO of a non-profitable Twitter.  Layoffs were inevitable.  I would never fault him for coming in and making changes.New leadership always does. But the amount of vitriol garbage that I see in comments about the layoffs is what’s disgusting. These are lives of HUMANS fellow human beings that are totally upended.Their only fault? They worked for Twitter in the Musk-era. I understand layoffs. I’ve laid people off and been laid off. As long as it is done in a humane way it’s part of life. But stop belittling those who are laid off or making it seem like no big deal. Because someday… you may find yourself staring down that same path. And no doubt you’ll hope there’s a helpful community offering support.Support people. Help jobseekers. Be a good human.#beagoodhuman #bebetter #layoffs #opentowork

Quick reminder:layoffs[dot]fyi is a thing, and I encourage recruiters to leverage it because there's a lot more activity in the market beyond the headliners (e.g., Stripe, Lyft, potentially Twitter come tomorrow).For example, did you know that just this month, there's already been layoffs at 16 other companies, totaling at least ~1700 candidates? I didn't, until now!And because my spider senses tell me that someone will misconstrue this post as me trying to be dismissive of big tech layoffs: GTFOH.#hiring #layoffs #recruiting

Hi All,Stripe let 14% of its workforce go today.The folks I know that have been let go are amongst the best I've ever worked with, and - whilst I'm confident all of them will find something new in due course - I'd like to call out the fact that they are fantastic hires for any prospective employers.I'm going to share more names as I get permission from folks who were impacted, but I'd like to start with Robin Varghese, who has been such a brilliant Solutions Architect and teammate. An endless source of sunshine (and Marvel news) for the team; his disposition, work ethic and knowledge are an extraordinary asset. I've been so thankful for him jumping on a thread (so many times) at a moment's notice to provide his expertise and wisdom. If there is anybody out there looking for a phenomenal hire, you cannot go wrong with Robin.Additionally, if there is anybody hiring in general right now, please feel free to reach out or comment and I'll try and make the connections with my colleagues and friends who have been impacted by today's events.#stripe #layoffs #hiring

Hi LinkedIn 👋  As someone who wants to help friends & colleagues in my network get back on their feet after a layoff, I'd love to be able to filter by who is #opentowork and/or was caught up in one of the #layoffs that are all too common these days. I added a screenshot with what a possible filter could look like. Thanks!

Again a super tough time for International Immigrants! 😞 Stripe, Lyft laid off people, and soon Twitter will join this list too.To mention what tough times means are below:1. Our Visa gets into danger, we cannot stay unemployed for more than 60 days else we will be deported back.2. Financial burden, many immigrants have to support families, pay rent, EMIs etc, the list is never ending.3. Out of health insurance (if company removes it, luckily Stripe didn’t Lyft I'm not aware). Visiting doctors are super expensive, insurance is a must here.List goes on!Interview preparation, applying companies, getting calls, doing household work etc in midst of this pressure is difficult.I would like to call upon all my International Community to please comment down your details here if your company is actively hiring!Atleast this much we can do, we can reduce the efforts of getting an interview call for them.

I find myself impacted by the #layoffs at #stripe today. It was such an enjoyable 1.5 years and I will greatly miss the people I worked with.   It's hard to truly describe how wonderful my colleagues are.Where ever is next will hopefully be just as impactful. I'm going to take some time to strategize. If you're aware of any opportunities in project management or the HR space let me know.

What is happening in FinTech? And Tech in general?This week, Stripe announced a 14% reduction of staff, and Chargebee a 10%. Here are potential contributors and 3 things to never do when Layoffs are required.Contributing factors:- Stripe, Chargebee, and other subscription billing platforms create pricing based on value, usage, and total processing volume (the total revenue you process). Think of this number as 1%. As so many SaaS companies are starting to plan for next year there's some fear, stress, and hair-pulling happening, for the simple reason that everyone may be forecasting to flat line or see a dip of 10% or 20% in their revenue in 2023. This - in a very direct way - impacts the pricing/and forecasted revenue for the billing platforms. - During the pandemic both companies leaned hard into Remote Forever and hired many positions to bulk up for product, support, and expansion roles. If 2023 is going to be a bit colder and more about helping retain current customers,users, A accounts, then some of those hires will need to go find their next roles elsewhere. It's sad, frustrating, and impacts these new hires the most. But it's business. That's SaaS I guess. Ups and some downs and growth over the long haul. Things to never do in a Layoff:1/ Request back all the Laptops. NO.Why?For so many employees - the work laptop is The family laptop. Just wipe it and give it to the employee.2/ Give two-week severance or 0 severance. NO. Offer enough time for folks to get back on their feet. Industry-standard in SaaS appears to be 2-3 Months. What have you seen as a fair severance?The layoffs this week are really the last shoe to drop. Google, Twitter, Meta/FB, have all done belt-tightening, and now the elite SaaS FinTech cos like stripe and chargebee had to cut so they can grow in the back half of 2023. See comments for more and to help the Chargebee tribe their next role. There's been a lot of posts from their team and as a proud Alum, it speaks volumes that so many past and present employees are treating this like they're trying to help a friend get back up. #layoffs #saas #recurringrevenue

Yesterday was a hard day for the people at Chargebee, especially for the ones who got laid off. It easily could have been me or anyone else. You never anticipate such things to happen, but some things are out of our control.My request:There are many talented employees impacted and we want to help them find their next position. If you are looking to hire, please drop a note to outplacement@chargebee.com with your region and hiring needs, and we’ll connect you to the right candidates.#chargebee #layoffs

#layoffs are coming hard. If I were an SDR or an AE trying to finish the year strong, I wouldn't take my chances relying on 1-2 contacts in an account.Go wide. The more prospects you are engaged with, the less likely your deal will stall or be closed-lost. #sdr #salesdevelopment
-----------------------------
To my network: layoffs suck but YOU DO NOT ❤️ for those in my network who have been affected by another round of layoffs, I’m deeply sorry and completely understand what you’re feeling. feel the feels and take your time. if I can help out by connecting you with people in my network, please let me know 🤗 #layoffs #findwork #jobseekers

I would like to encourage all Stripe employees who were recently a part of their #layoffs to consider open roles within the #digital #product space within JPMorgan.

It is pretty painful to see this second wave of layoffs, with this one hitting more of the finance industry. Not an easy time right now, but take some time to recover first, then start tackling! At Karat we have seen an increase in our openings with roles in product, sales, and engineering. If you were impacted, and see a potential fit, shoot me a message and let me connect you with the recruiter on the role! #layoffs #jobseekers #openings
-----------------------------
For those affected during the #layoffs, my heart goes out to you. My hope is that you are being swarmed with opportunities, if you're looking. However, I wanna offer my messages if you need someone to speak to. We live in heavy times, an ear is often what someone may need. Always rooting for you. Feel free to reach out!

#Layoffs in #Tech continue to happen. Just yesterday in #Vancouver, Hootsuite announced another 5% (50 people) staff reduction, in addition to the 400 let go in August, and today Dapper Labs announced 22% (130ish people).Check out this email sent today from Stripe CEO Patrick Collison and President John Collison announcing a 14% reduction in staff. Talk about taking ownership. This has to be one of the best emails I've seen yet regarding layoffs. Bravo for approaching this with extreme empathy and transparency.
-----------------------------
To my Stripe fam, current and former: it’s been a wild *nearly* 7 year ride and I’m so incredibly grateful for the people who I’ve had the pleasure of crossing paths with - what a talented, damn smart, scrappy group of unicorns we are!! I’m saddened that my time with Stripe had to end like this, but I’m hopeful of new experiences and opportunities on the horizon! My heart is with everyone else who were part of the 14%. We will persevere and I’m here to support you all however I can as well! 💜💜 #stripe #layoffs

Adding myself to the “just got laid off” world out here. It’s brutal in the #mortgage industry with respect to staying employed 😥 #layoffs #unemployed
-----------------------------
Transparency can cause discomfort or fear, and even the loss of employees. But don't they deserve to know what's going on in THEIR organization?Lately, the layoffs that have been happening are blindsiding humans who work hard and have bills to pay. Sucker-punching with a same-day pink slip is the opposite of safety and "good culture."

You will not regret it.

Opendoor lays off 550 staffers   #layoffs Opendoor CEO Eric Wu said in a blog post that the online real estate company has laid off 550 staffers — a move that shrinks its headcount by 18%. Prior to these job cuts, the company had already “scaled back” its workforce “by over 830 positions.” A type of data-driven house flipper known as an iBuyer, #Opendoor flourished during the pandemic, when home prices were at their peak. But the abrupt slide in housing demand forced the firm to sell homes for less than it paid, Bloomberg reports. “We’re navigating one of the most challenging real estate markets in 40 years,” Wu wrote.  Opendoor employees affected by the layoffs have taken to LinkedIn to share their experiences and reach out to their networks. See their posts below.#layoff #jobs #linkedin #realestate #business

Today’s been a crazy day and unfortunately I have been a part of the layoffs at #Stripe. I am so grateful for the people I have met so far on my career journey and I’m looking forward to what’s next.The past year has been one for the books considering all the change that has happened with acquisitions, new teams and now an ending of a chapter. But overall I am optimistic for the future and grateful for the experiences I’ve had, relationships I’ve built and areas where I’ve grown. For anyone else going through layoffs please reach out and lean on me as a resource (resume help, interview help, just someone to talk to, etc.) as we work through this together ❤️ And to my network if anyone knows of great opportunities working with great people please let me know since I am #opentowork 🙂#stripelayoffs #recruiters #layoffs #hiring #openroles

Feeling for everyone impacted by this week's #layoffs over at Stripe, Lyft, Hootsuite, Opendoor, Booking.com and many others. (Also for the folks over at Twitter - in general.

Even though the world is going through too much trouble ATM, it's still far too often that we're seeing companies laying off talented individuals.While layoffs are unfortunately inevitable, there are better (less bad?) ways of doing them. At the risk of sounding ironic (definitely not intended!), there are more humane ways of doing so. And those deserve some lauding.Having been hit by a layoff some years back, I can say it's not an easy situation to be in. These measures help to soften the blow. Which still sucks.Strange times. I want to believe we're almost at the end of it. Hold on!#layoffs #humane #togetherness

I have a question.We all know so many layoffs are taking place everywhere.What I don't get is....Why are they still hiring after firing so many of their own talents?My questions are:🎯 The jobs on their career page; are they just not being updated or are they hiring after laying off their own talent?🎯Are they giving preferential consideration to those who got laid off if they are still hiring internally?🎯 Are they trying to reallocate those talent? (and use layoff as their last resort?)#layoff #layoffs #laidoff #talent #hiring

Second of all, here is my cat, which I hope gives you some dopamine.I was laid off in June from {Company who shall not be named} and managed to make an incredible recovery by starting my own business. I'm very passionate about sharing resources with anyone who wants to do the same.Comment or DM or whatever you like. I'm here to help.#layoffs #laidoff #layoffsandjobreductions

RecruitersNow is a time to make sure we are treating candidates as people and not just numbers or names in our ATS. There are a bunch of people who have been laid off over the last month and likely a bunch more in the coming months. Each of these people are probably scared about what the future holds, anxious about how they will keep food on their table, and desperately looking for their next role. Let's make sure that we give them prompt feedback and let them know exactly where they are in the process. And please DO NOT ghost your applicants. Take some extra time to send them valuable feedback on why they were not selected and how they can improve their application for the next time. #recruiters #people #layoffs

Hello to all my Bay Area connections! A number of local companies have announced lay offs recently - notably Lyft today. I think many of us have anticipated the slow down for some time now but it is still sad to hear when it happens. I'm grateful to be able to say that while there is some contraction in some areas, there are still a large number of well funded, cash rich clients in the bay area hiring! We have lots of roles at most levels hot and moving, from senior accountant to VP Controller so please let me know if you or someone you know has been impacted -- I would love to partner and hopefully provide some positive solutions! #layoffs #bayareajobs #accountingjobs #financejobs #startups#cpajobs #accountant #hiring

“We regret to inform you but your role is being eliminated and your services are no longer needed.”That’s a message absolutely no one wants to be told or to hear, at any time. Even worse, getting up to start your day as you normally would, attempting to log on and realizing you no longer have access. Gut wrenching and heart crushing.That’s what some are going through today and what many have been going through over the course of the last several months as the US economy has taken a major hit in an effort to combat inflation.Though most company leaders will point to the “macro-economy” as the reasons for the decisions being made, everyone impacted has their own ‘micro-economy’ to think of: their families.How will they provide? How soon will they land their next gig? Christmas is next month. Are they going to be able to get their kids anything? All thoughts that are absolutely terrifying.What I can suggest is this: take care of your mental health. Being laid off is hard. Whatever feelings that are a result of that triggering event must absolutely be acknowledged and processed. Do that for yourself and for your loved ones near and dear to you.I know that it doesn’t seem like it right now, and it may not seem like it tomorrow, next week or even next month… But everything is going to be okay. Everything is going to work itself out.If there’s someone in my network you’re interested to speak with, I’d be happy to make the connection. Sending positive vibes to all.#mentalhealth #network #economy #layoffs

Stripe lays off 14% of its work force .#layoffs “In terms of severance, Collison noted that all those impacted would receive at least 14 weeks’ worth of pay, depending on time served at the company. On top of that, he noted that Stripe will pay the full 2022 annual bonus, though it will be pro-rated if they only joined this year. Additionally, he said that all unused paid time off (PTO) will be paid, and Stripe will provide healthcare coverage for six months following each departure.” #dotherightthing

Super disappointing to see another round of layoffs at my former company Lyft today. I can attest that these folks are intelligent with a strong work ethic and just a blast to work with!To those affected by layoffs at Lyft or elsewhere, please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like a resume review or a chat about how to conduct your next job search or just someone to listen!  Book some complementary time with me here: https://lnkd.in/g8HDB2GN Most importantly, please take care of yourself and allow yourself time to grieve. While it is just a job, it was also your livelihood, a team you belonged to, and a (virtual) place you spent 40+ hours a week at. It's a loss nonetheless, so allow yourself some time. #layoffs #resumereview #jobsearch

While we all feel for those impacted by recent layoffs, this is your reminder not to forget those who have been out of work for months. #layoffs #techcareers #unemployment If unemployment is under 4%, why are so many of us not working?

This article hits very close to home. I’ve always believed that likability, productivity, and adaptability were the keys to finding and securing your place in an organization. Being a person that energizes and encourages others is also extremely valuable! This is excellent advice for anyone that’s feeling the recession squeezing in on their professional life. You really want to be the person that the organization would hate to lose. #cloudhired #architectyourdreams #lastonestanding

The "News and Percentage of Layoffs" have been part of daily updates on LinkedIn. This is the scenario that not only impacts a particular individual or employees of a particular company but has been responsible for creating a sense of fear with respect to "Job security" in the employees of other companies too.Some of us - Sourcers and Recruiters - might/can definitely align you with opportunities in our respective organizations but we can never lessen the pain or whatever that feeling is. I know, everyone thinks - Talent Acquisition is mostly about numbers but the reality is these individuals also have empathy, and even though they are reaching out to you as soon as the news is announced - they are trying to bring you closer to your next opportunity- so it doesn't seem to be a layoff but your personal choice to leave the company.#layoffs #opportunities #empathy #jobsecurity #reachout

Layoffs are challenging moments for both employees & employers. No Company aims to let go of performers & contributors that form the company's essence.My understanding about Layoffs (may bring a lot of differences of opinion, but I welcome differences)1. As an employee, you should ask yourself whether you can contribute more than what you're asked for at the job. [That's how you win at your Role]2. Are you becoming indispensable and hard to replace due to your outstanding contribution and performance? [The way you contribute matters]3. Can you make your team's work easier or create positive energy for folks around you? [Proactive leadership attitude helps]4. Are you able to create systems that ensure your work is done? [Good documentations help]The world may feel sorry about you upon layoffs, but very few folks would turn up and help.Yet, you have the biggest help to get, provided you look for it within yourself and ask yourself for it.You are the biggest help for yourself and then your network.Use the time to -- Upskill & Learn Hard & Soft Skills.- Build Network to not just look for Jobs or Help but to know people & build genuine connections (everything else works out eventually)- Self Review & Self Introspection.Remember, people love to help those who are helping themselves in 1st place.Smart people love to work with those who aim to contribute and bring more than what they can do or what they know.So, find your right fit role and right fit company.It could take time but in the end its all worth finding a good match.PS: At ForeignAdmits we are hiring for few profiles - 1. Key Account Manager (Delhi, NCR - 2-4 yrs Exp.; EdTech)2. Content Writer (Bengaluru - 2-3yrs Exp. B2B & SEO)3.

I remember when I lost a new job due to a hiring freeze in 2020. It destroyed me. I was just planning to move into a new role when the rug was pulled right from under me. I see a lot of people on linkedin this week/month/quarter going through the same thing I went through. If you're in my network and have been recently laid off, please reach out to me, your family, your friends, and let them know what types of roles you're looking for. I found a new career @technologyadvice through a friend of mine on linkedin. I went to my network and told them what I was searching for, and they came through for me. Take some time to be sad, be mad, and let it out! You are allowed to feel upset and frustrated. But don't let that keep you from your next big adventure and journey in life! I know you can pick yourself back up, use your resources and network, gain new skills. You never know what great adventure will be down the road. I never would've thought I'd end up in Talent Acquisition when I started at TA. But here I am 2 1/2 years in, and  loving my team, my work, and my journey. You've got this! And I believe in you!

When looking for a new job/company or even at your current company, ask yourself this:Who are the rockstars? And what I mean by rockstars is - what are the roles/who are the people that get the most shine, recognition and value in the company.And let's be honest: at most companies there are rockstars, a role/team/department that just seems to matter a little bit more. - At Google the engineers might be the rockstars. - At Salesforce the sales people might be the rockstars. - At Nike the marketers might be the rockstars. And here is why that matters. These internal "rockstars" don't just get a little bit more shine, they are usually rockstars because the company's DNA is built around them. - That means decision will be made with them in mind first. - That more resources will be allocated to them. - That the next senior leaders will often come from there. It matters. So, be sure to know where you fit in. #work #jobs #layoffs #cs #customersuccess #saas #people #revsetter

Tech workers who lived through dot-com bust, here's my personal experience and thoughts via this tweet. Maybe it helps someone 22+ years ago during the dot-com bust of 2000, I had just moved to the bay area with little savings, was on a work-visa (60-day clock to leave the country begins). And if I can help, make any intros, have a brief chat, I'm happy to.https://lnkd.in/g5eQqxG7 #work #layoffs #tech

A glimpse at the LinkedIn News tab I had first thing this morning. The afternoon update to that reel includes headlines of an #amazon and #apple hiring freeze and a #twitter "purge".Last week I met students at ASU to discuss preparing your resume for the real world. You know what students are probably not prepared for? #Layoffs. I hope college counselors, professors, parents of young adults entering the work force are teaching them what a lay off is, what a separation agreement is and how to stay calm and positive if you are impacted by a layoff. The year I graduated college there was a recession. The only reason I felt a tiny bit prepared to job search in that market was that I watched my Father need to do it to bounce back from the job security turmoil that followed 9/11. It is not all doom and gloom out there although the news says so and although it may feel so. I'm not one for toxic positivity, but I honestly wouldn't mind seeing a news tab maybe one day per week that can help people feel a bit more hopeful. #layoff #techjobs #recruiting #linkedinnews #peoplefirst #linkedin

Fellow Tweeps, I have a heartfelt message for all of you whom I've grown to know and love over the past two years:Don't wait for tomorrow morning. Don't wait to see whether your system access has been revoked and an email is waiting in your personal inbox. Don't.It doesn't really matter at this point whether you get the letter or you don't. It's over. The platform and product as you knew it is over.The leadership that you loved and respected is over.The company culture and coworkers that made you stay at Twitter despite the headwinds of change over our past year, is over. It's time for you to make a decision for YOU. What do you want to do next? What drives you? What is your passion? Where is that intersection of your 'genius zone' skillset and what people will pay for (market demand)?Whether you are one of the thousands (rumored to be) laid off tomorrow, or whether you are one of those who remain, no one can tell you who you are and how you should live your life. All that remains now is for you to accept that regardless what side the coin lands for you tomorrow, nothing will ever be as it was. There is a Taoist saying: "Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you." I pray peace and contentment for all the wonderful people I met, worked alongside and cried and laughed with these past couple years. Our work did truly make a difference in the lives of millions. May you maintain a mindset of abundance rather than scarcity. Don't let anyone take that away from you whether you stay or whether you go. Love and light to my network. May your holidays be blessed and reflective. ✨ #Leadership #HighTech #Culture #Layoffs #AfterHoursThoughts #Gratitude #OwnYourFuture

I see more layoff posts today.  😔Please feel free to reach out to me and anyone else at Corelight because we are still hiring and we will be more than happy to help in any possible way. An unexpected package arrived from a coworker today. The employee at Corelight sent a box of single use masks for my mom.  WOW. 😮 I remembered chatting with a team about my mom’s age, health issues, and that she wears masks all the time and puts a few masks in the glove compartment. Again, this is the kind of culture we have here at Corelight.  So awesome. 😊#hiring #technology #CyberSecurity #NDR #networksecurity #cloudsecurity #hiringtalent #hiringengineers #layoffs #layoff #softwareengineers #productmanagers #cybersecurity #wicys #womenincybersecurity  #WiCySSD

Have you heard about the recent corporate #layoffs and #hiring freezes?Amazon and other Top Tech Companies have stopped hiring for corporate positions. According to unnamed sources from Business Insider, Apple has reportedly "paused all hiring practically," possibly until late 2023. Can we anticipate that more of the major FIRMS in the world will be doing the same?

Forresters report on the #futureofwork predicts “a perplexing, talent-constrained #recession” in 2023. Smart firms will invest in employee #experience (EX), but a majority will revert to seeing employees as mere cost centers. Conventional wisdom suggests that, in anticipation of an economic downturn, companies should consider #layoffs, hiring freezes, and other ways to reduce headcount or labor spend. But that’s not necessarily been the case this time around.One of Forrester’s messages to clients has been “Don’t spend as much time asking what #other companies are doing, but rather rely on primary research with your own employees, with your own customers, and and determine what your solution needs to be, as opposed to hoping to adopt someone else’s solution.”

Today, I stumbled into a #hackernews article about the recent Stripe lay-offs: https://lnkd.in/eAKsvhwGAnd two questions came to my mind. Question 1:   What is the right way to lay people off?       Option 1: [Stripe way] Sending a note to the employees, that:  "If you are among those impacted, you will receive a notification email within the next 15 minutes. For those of you leaving: we’re very sorry to be taking this step and John and I are fully responsible for the decisions leading up to it."      Option 2: Send the personal managers to talk to the people and be at the office and give the opportunity for everyone to talk to you.Question 2:   If you're #founder or #ceo , how do you show that this is the last stop to save the company and you are fully responsible for the decisions leading to the #layoffs ?      Decreasing your salary      Cut your own stock grants      Distributing your bonus between the employees      Anything else...

During the frenzied market of the past two years, top #lawfirms hired #associates that, under normal circumstances, they probably would not have considered.  These are perfectly fine #attorneys in other scenarios, but they do not have what it takes to be competitive in a #biglaw environment where 2000 billable hours is the floor and fast-paced deals are the norm.Now that things have slowed down somewhat, firms are beginning to return to the #prepandemic requirements of #hiring and #retention.  That means that those that don't make the cut are being "nicely" shown the door.High-level #recruiters are offering their services to these top firms in an effort to "re-home" these attorneys.  Why?  Because #midlevellawfirms (where these attorneys rightly belong) have a strong need for them.  These firms were the places that these attorneys were "stolen" from in the first place and have been suffering from an associate shortage ever since.  These firms will gladly welcome top-trained and experienced associates into their ranks.So, unlike past market downturns which saw attorneys' lives devasted by top firm layoffs, this doesn't portend to be as life and/or career-altering.#layoffs #lateralhiring #midlevellawfirms #biglaw

Am I the only one a little confused by all these layoffs in the tech world? It isn't like many of these companies weren't making money hand-over-fist to hand out crazy bonuses and stock buy backs for ages now. The demand for many of their products isn't going to change even if the economy does take the dip I've been anticipating for about 5 or 6 years. Seems odd. 👨‍🔧 #tech #economy #techboom #elonmusk #twitter #facebook #stripe #opendoor #tesla #tiktok #layoffs #netflix #shopify #robinhood #corporategreed #stockbuybacks

wonder how this will affect the ad system on the site. foreseeing lots of people pulling out of the business as it will become more lucrative. interested to see, will be watching closely
-----------------------------
Can someone explain it to me like I’m 5? How do companies over and over again say their employees are their greatest asset but cut heads like it’s the French Revolution? How do they report great earnings, give CEOs multimillion dollar salaries and bonuses, and then eliminate the people who actually do the work that makes the company profitable - and do it at barely adequate wages (if they’re lucky). Why isn’t “leadership” measured by the leader’s ability to bring everyone beneath them along in their success instead of by how much money they can make for a small few? I don’t have answers, but I do have a cute pony in the snow. If you’re in the #denver area and you’ve been impacted by #layoffs you’re welcome to contact Leg Up Learning Solutions LLC for some no-cost horse hugs.  #leadership #capitalism #corporategreed

Hi, Lady!Yes, I heard. The markets are going just a little berserk globally, and the US is no exception. You know what that means—lots of layoffs. How you fare this November and December depends on what industry you work in, what position you hold, what your niche is, the person you work for, the departmental budget, the CEO's tolerance for uncertainty, the toss of a coin, the phase of the moon...But cheer up and stay prayed up. Don't let the possibility (or the current reality) get to you.

— 👋 #OfferingHelp: General HelpNo Man Is An Island - John Donne's “Devotions” (1624): “No man is an Island, entire of it self; every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main.”Day 5 of 10 - #lifeisgood I’m a bit at a loss today, having seen numerous posts about more layoffs in the past couple of days…..myself included 90 days ago.We are all more similar than not.  When the tragedy of job loss hits…. a rollercoaster enters (stage left).  Did I plan for this? Was I too naïve to think it would last longer? Did I give myself time to think of how life would look/feel working elsewhere, or unemployed? Did I take time to grow and learn something new? Or, was I just grinding away on a job binge trip.  The thing is that while we are employed we ride a different rollercoaster.  You know the one I speak of.  You tussle between time at work and time with loved ones….. taking on too much or collaborating ….. do I WFH or go to the office …. Will they hate me or forget me if I WFH 3 days a week.The relevance to John Donne’s quotation?  If you’re reading this and are on this layoff rollercoaster, please know this platform is one of the right places to be.  Job loss is a LOSS and comes with all the stages of grief.  Oh and that little sucker shame is wrapped in there too.  I challenge you to feel all the feels and know there many of us here reading and wanting to help.  I don’t have a job for you but I can give you support.  Why, because “no man is an island” and Karma is real. #layoffs #teamplayer #karma #weneedeachother #jobloss #readytowork
