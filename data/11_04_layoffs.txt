I recently made a personal and vulnerable post to help my household, and unfortunately I must do so again - as of this morning I was impacted by a company layoff. I'm appreciative of the amazing people I got to work with and the support given to me to really craft my role within the studio.I really wish to stay in the industry I'm so passionate about in player facing roles, such as a support/community manager. Making the gaming industry and their communities safe, diverse, and accessible is extremely important to me, so I'd love to join a studio that share these values as well! Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, kind words, or opportunities you can offer. #OpenToWork #gamingjobs #layoffs

I'm surprised I haven't seen more coverage of this email from Stripe CEO following their layoffs this week.  A colleague shared it with me this morning.  With so many layoffs happening right now, this is an excellent example of leading with humanity through really hard decisions and discussions.  In the words of Bren√© Brown, "Clear is kind, unclear is unkind." A few words come to mind after I read this - accountability, vulnerability, empathy and kindness.  Traits that more leaders should lead with and few do.If you've been impacted by a layoff, I've been there, let me know how I can help.  #layoffs

After about two years at Twitter, Today, which was supposed to be the first day of a well deserved PTO, happened to be the end of a chapter in my career. I lost access to all internal systems, which I interpreted obviously as a sign that I am part of the unlucky 50%. I do not want this post to be about me (although I am also #opentowork *wink wink* üòâ) , I wanted to leverage my LinkedIn Network to help my comrades in Product Trust and the extended Trust & Safety family that were impacted by #layoffs. Do my dear Network of friends, ex colleagues, ex managers and LinkedIn connections, If you're a hiring manager, a recruiter, or a leader in a company looking for T&S superstars, you are about to be tapping into a gold mine, the best talents in the industry without any exaggeration.From Safety cybercrime investigators, Content and Product policy specialist, Risk and compliance professionals to Operations and Project Management expert, you will definitely find your holy grail.Please comment or DM me and I will be able to recommend the right person/people.Thank you all!

We lost an amazing group of individuals yesterday due to the #layoffs at Stripe. I‚Äôve always felt like the biggest asset to Stripe is our people, and what makes Stripe employees so special is that not only are they absolutely brilliant, creative, and passionate in what they do, they‚Äôre some of the kindest, most thoughtful, and genuine people I‚Äôve ever met.¬†If you see a Stripe‚Äôs resume hit your inbox, please do yourself a favor by following up on it.

Are we officially in a recession yet? The layoff season is off, and it's a season where everyone is scared, the founders to lose their best talent, the workforce, losing their job. ..but reading the following like these at the start of November:- Twitter is laying off 50% of its workforce. - Bjyu is laying off 2500+ of its workforce. - Stripe is laying off 14% of its workforce. - Oracle continues its restructuring. - Microsoft is cutting staff. The list goes on if you keep searching for the term layoff on Google. This is a scary scenario for young startup founders because this is highly demotivating and scary. The same is the scenario for the workforce who are scared they could be next. How are you preparing for the recession and the layoff season? #job #startup #recession #layoffs

Sadly, I was affected by Stripe's layoffs yesterday. I started at Stripe as a contract recruiter through Hirewell in mid 2021 and fell in love with the company. I¬†was fortunate enough to get an offer after my contract ended & joined as a full-time employee in November 2021 & I was ecstatic.¬†I can honestly say that I've never loved a job more. I had the privilege¬†of working with so many smart, motivated & genuine people and grew so much as a recruiter.I was hoping to be at Stripe for many years but sometimes things don't go as planned and that's okay. I truly believe that everything¬†happens for a reason & I hope I find¬†out what that reason is sooner rather than later. Thanks to Addy R., Kelly M. & Kit Evans for being the best leaders and to the best team - Karin Hongladarom, Brian Kustera, Katie Keohane (she/her), Griffin Weston, Hannah Thompson, Max Ames, Janine Paat, Christina Hwang, Aaron Emas & Lindsay Ritchie. I'll miss working with you all so much.‚ù§ I'm jumping into the job search on Monday so if anyone knows of any great companies hiring senior recruiters (remote) - please message me. #stripe #layoffs #recruiterjobs

No company branded post from me today, now is not the time. As the hashtag #layoffs run's rampant across my Linkedin feed, this is Terry the person, popping my hand aloft & saying:> Can I help? whether our connection is purely a Linkedin one or from here & elsewhere too, if you think I can make an intro, point you in a direction, or just listen, I got you. I'm Shoreditch based, available for lunch coffees or after, calls, messages & emails too.> Can anyone I know on here/elsewhere help? I been around a while, maybe I'm a "shared connection" of someone you want to approach on here/elsewhere, don't hesitate to ask, network is community by another name & community helps at times like these!> Talk about it! to your family, your mates, those who you care for & who care for you, it will help.> It will be okay! yea, yea you'll be sick to the eye teeth of hearing that line come Monday, but it will. I got laid off by email (pre-Elon!), my wife was heavily pregnant, we had a holiday booked for a matter of days later AND childcare costs through the roof. Something better than good, better than before landed in my lap, but not before the sleepless nights, the weight of "those" feelings & general lostness!There are people, people that know a lot more than me & can offer much more help too:https://lnkd.in/eD9iVR6shttps://www.mind.org.uk/https://lnkd.in/eabu6ctMI guess my final point is, I know an awful lot of folk in hiring positions & I feel sure that if they aren't already getting in touch with those of you posting "that" hashtag they will be over the coming days, you will find your better than before.Mate, it will be okay! I have no priceless wisdom as to how to handle debts/money & all that, all I got is that one simple fact, it will be okay!(With a truck load of sincerity & zero bitterness as to my past experience)
-----------------------------
Today let's focus on how to move forward if you've been laid off. My heart goes out to all of you. No one wants to hear those words. Lyft 13% of workersOpendoor 18%Stripe 14%Chime 12%Twitter 50%Morgan Stanley (% unknown)So take a couple of days to process it all.  Take care of yourself. First and foremost. It's normal to feel pretty crappy. Even if you thought it might happen. It's a shock. But it‚Äôs not your fault. Or a reflection of your work. It is simply due to the economy or the fact a new owner is changing the structure of their company.  Try to focus on facts. Not on your feelings. Be sure to get a letter from HR. Stating you were caught up in a lay-off and it was not due to your performance. Get recommendations in writing, now. Not when you need them further into your search. They become hard to get at that point. I see that happen all the time. And lastly get the help you need to start a strategic and planned job search. We are all rooting for each of you! #jennsjobs #help #layoffs

Apparently everyone decided to do layoffs this week.My heart goes out to everyone impacted and would like to help as many as possible. If you have been laid off or if you are looking for a job then let's connect and I'll try my best to find you a role suitable to your profile.#layoffs #Hiring

There are so many talented individuals that have been laid off recently.It‚Äôs unfortunate to see the lack of empathy that some employers have shown towards those that have been laid off. This includes companies that have conducted layoffs, and some that are hiring.My goal for this post is to help as many people as possible who have been laid off and are seeking employment. Here‚Äôs one tip that I recommend to help optimize your LinkedIn profile: take full advantage of the ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù section!Add up to 50 skills that are relevant to your experience and the role you‚Äôre seeking. Pro tip: you can associate each skill with a specific experience on your LinkedIn profile!The next step is to get skill endorsements from your 1st degree connections. This increases the likelihood that you‚Äôll be discovered for opportunities related to the skills on your profile.If you‚Äôve been recently laid off, comment below and let others know what opportunities you‚Äôre looking for. Add skills to your profile and let‚Äôs connect if we‚Äôre not already. I‚Äôll endorse you, and hopefully others will as well!What other tips do you have to optimize your LinkedIn profile? Share in the comments!#linkedin #layoffs #skillsforthefuture

Early in my corporate HR career, I had a role in layoffs that were about to hit the company for which I worked. It was awful, at times felt very clinical in how the cuts were being made, but one thing was clear from the time the discussions started: we are talking about people that we were about to tip their lives upside down, and we must always regard these people with as much dignity as possible. The media has made a lot of comments about the layoffs at Twitter today, mostly about the CEO. Let's shift the focus to the people who are finding out via email whether they have a job or not. These people deserve to be treated with dignity.  Even if you cannot directly help someone impacted, connect with them on LinkedIn to open up your network to them as perhaps someone else can. If you're a recruiter, in HR, or hiring, add the I'm hiring frame to your profile picture to be a friendly face. And for those of you impacted, add that open to work frame and hashtag.#networking #connections #layoffs #twitter

Time and time again, tech leaders commoditize hiring during periods of peak growth.They use headcount size and velocity to send signals of success to the market. But bloated cap tables aren't signals of success, rather they are signs of unsustainable growth and inefficiency. Unfortunately, our fellow talent leaders pay the heftiest price. People typically account for 70% of business OpEx. . .. . .And so of course, recruitment teams are seen as the biggest cost center and are often the first to go.Today's era calls for a different approach to talent management. To stay nimble, people leaders are going to have to introduce more flexible talent structures to their organization; fractional and embedded recruitment solutions that can scale up or down at a moment's notice. . .We've seen this in many different verticals; marketing agencies, IT, management consulting, and other service-based organizations popularly deploy "full stack" engagement teams that can manage workflows end-to-end, and at the fraction of the cost. Core people teams should be given the opportunity to be up-skilled and trained across the organization. That's where our value is. . .Transformation > Transaction#layoffs

A job layoff is a traumatic event even in the best circumstances. I don't think the memory ever truly fades, I vividly remember the moment I received my layoff notice via UPS one week after buying my first house. Each round of layoffs I see in the industry triggers that memory, such as those impacted at Twitter today. Anyone in my network who has been impacted, please know that I would happily be a resource for you --- job referrals, connections or even a cup of coffee together.

Layoffs make headlines, but startup hiring is the stat to watch.In 2021, on average, startups on Carta made nearly 3 hires for every departing employee (whether those departures were voluntary or layoffs).So far this year, that ratio is down to 1.77 hires / departure. You can see the orange bars below indicating a month where the number of employees shrank across the platform. Those include April 2020 (for obvious reasons) and August & Sept 2022.Hiring data can filter into our systems slowly, so I'd expect the most recent months to bump up over the coming weeks. But there's no denying that a hiring chill has come along as an unwelcome partner to the layoff headlines.Sending ‚ù§Ô∏è to the former Tweeps today - layoffs always hurt, but that one seems particularly poorly done. #hiring #layoffs #startups ________________If you found this insightful, consider joining our weekly Data Minute newsletter.

Absolutely disheartening to see previous colleagues, friends, and others get impacted by the current state of the economy and tech industry in general. I've been in your position twice and it does not get any easier.For those dusting off your resumes, please send them to me and I am happy to do a resume review and provide overall feedback, especially having been a hiring manager for many years now and having worked at LinkedIn. Usually within 30 seconds, I can gauge what to adjust.If there is a job opening that I know that you would fit, I can connect you there. If there is not, I can at least provide guidance on where to look as I am in the recruiting space through AngelList Talent.My immediate tips!- STAY RELEVANT: ensure your profiles on various platforms are fully up to date (LinkedIn, AngelList, incubator networks, etc.) - otherwise sending old irrelevant information isn't helpful.- QUANTIFY YOUR RESUME: if you were an excellent recruiter, being able to quantify that you "worked closely with 40 candidates on a weekly basis, nurturing relationships through the pipeline, and led to 4 conversions/week" rings bells that your skills are relevant even in a customer success, sales role, etc.- EXPOSE YOURSELF: when I was laid off before, I felt embarrassed and wanted to just hide at first. Then realized that by staying hidden, I was not exposing myself to other opportunities. There is NO shame in being unemployed. Let others know that you are actively looking and excited for a new journey, let them know what specific types of roles you are looking for, and what industry/companies are exciting to you. Those with networks can then effectively intro you. Stating that you are open to any job in marketing does not help us pinpoint exactly who we can intro you to.#layoffs #impacted #stripe #lyft #helppeoplefindjobs #twitter

Stripe laid off 1100 employees yesterday.¬†¬†It makes me sad that we are now giving the CEO heaps of praise because he did it the ‚Äúright way.‚ÄùYes, they did it the right way.Yes, the CEO took responsibility. He showed empathy. He was transparent and honest.¬†Yes, they are taking care of those affected. They are offering severance and health care and help finding new jobs. Yes, they laid people off with direct managers and humanely.But we shouldn‚Äôt be impressed.Why?¬†Because this should be the norm. This shouldn‚Äôt be the case of a hero CEO.¬†This should be any company that is forced to make these difficult decisions.  This should just be how it is. They worked hard for you. They did all that was asked of them. They did nothing incorrectly other than working at the wrong place at the wrong time.Instead of giving heaps of praise to a CEO that just laid off 1100 people and did it "right"...Why don‚Äôt we see layoffs as disruption to PEOPLE. We are throwing thousands of HUMANS with real families, real bills, and real needs into chaos. Until then.. I‚Äôm glad the CEO did what he did and happy for those affected that  they worked for a company with a moral conscience  I just wish it was the norm instead of the exception.¬†Be a good human#layoffs #ceos #leadership #opentowork

Faced with layoffs?Have you done everything in your power to avoid it, or did you see a smaller profit margin and hit the panic button to appease shareholders?We live in a time where anyone can Google your company's financials, and when things are on the economic upswing and you need top talent, if they see that you treated your people as expendable, they'll walk into the open arms of your competition.When facing the difficult decision to lay off staff, continually ask yourself:"What else could be true?""What else could I do?"There are always other options, but when we're in fight-or-flight mode, it's difficult to see them. It's why asking these kinds of questions is important -- they introduce new perspectives and possibilities.And if you MUST lay off, what can you do to help people land on their feet? Because your future team is watching, and whether they come help you or your competitors is based on what you do next.#layoffs #peoplefirst #culture #leadership #humorleadership
-----------------------------
I‚Äôm pissed off about these layoff announcements. I have witnessed some of the most irresponsible decision-making. Extravagant spending. Absurd expense accounts. Multiple millions of dollars thrown out the window for failed projects. And when it comes to the people, humans with bills, mortgages, children, aging parents who give up their time to help companies make profit ‚Äî they‚Äôre dispensable.Trim the fat. Tell them over email. But make sure those in our inner circles are taken care of.

‚ùìWhen we look back on this time in 3 years, where will you say your ethics fell? Were you good to people when you didn‚Äôt have to be?‚ùìü§îA harsh reality of employment law is that protections are defensive. These defenses only work if companies (and leaders) are scared of the punishment. Getting retribution is almost always a painful and long process for the wronged employee.If you have protections against redundancy and your company says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do that‚Äù - they can. Someone can just stop paying you, lock you out of your email, and tell you you have no job.Now it‚Äôs your responsibility to slap them on the wrist with the law.Most companies don‚Äôt fuck this up because they know it‚Äôs a bad idea to be awful to people. For a bunch of reasons.But‚Ä¶being good to employees is only important when it is a $good idea$.So what happens when it‚Äôs no longer a $good idea$ to be good to people? Well, we will see things like this more and more I fear.¬†Frothy venture capital markets made hiring hard. Salaries could be high, benefits were great, career progress was easy to come by.¬†When money is tight and layoffs abound, hiring is easier. There is less pressure in the employment market, higher cash restrictions internally, and potentially a bigger appetite for legal risk if you have plenty of cash where others have little.¬†It‚Äôs not a nice environment for workers, it‚Äôs not a nice environment for founders. So... when we look back on this time in 3 years, where will you say your ethics fell? Were you good to people when you didn‚Äôt have to be?¬† ‚ùì#TwitterLayoffs #layoffs #redundancy #PeopleOps #employmentlaw

It‚Äôs no secret that the ed-tech company BYJU‚Äôs has been under fire for their recent mass layoffs. 2500 employees have lost their jobs, and many have accused the company of setting unrealistic targets and pressuring them to quit.Now, BYJU‚Äôs has hired Lionel Messi as the global brand ambassador. On the one hand, this is a great move that will no doubt help the company‚Äôs image. On the other hand, it‚Äôs a tone-deaf move that shows how little the company cares about its former employees.Should we need regulation to control unwarranted layoffs? I say yes. No one should worry about losing their job because their company is trying to save a few bucks. What do you think?#byjus #messi #layoffs

What a ride. After 9 years, this is not how I thought it would end, but today is my last day at Twitter. It has been one of the best experiences of my life and I‚Äôve met so many amazing people during that time who will be friends for life. For that I will always be grateful.It‚Äôs hard to explain, but #Twitter was truly a special place and the #oneteam culture we created will be hard to replicate. There are too many to name, but thank you to everyone who made it so great along the way.That said, if you or anyone you know is looking for a Sr. Recruiter with a passion for ML and helping build great teams, please let me know. #layoffs #lovewhereyouwork #recruiting #tweeps #opentowork

If you have been impacted by #layoffs, please lean on me to provide support to you as you seek to find your next best opportunity. I have been on the receiving end of them before and I know how emotional and dispiriting it can feel.

If you are a developer, check out my friend Michael Morris's company Torc as a starting point, for example. You are not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏èüåé

Anyone with the slightest of empathy and true leadership skill will know that it is much more expensive and time consuming to layoff your best employees, re-hire, and re-train to achieve the same efficiency. I‚Äôm sad and angry to see how #elonmusk is treating my best friend and colleague, Rachel S., who was affected by the #twitter #layoffs I saw first hand the impeccable work Rachel does. She is one of the hardest workers I know. Of course, I expect nothing less from someone like Rachel, at a young age moved across the world to attend college in the US and achieved her masters in Ivy League. As she grows into a leadership position, the amount of thoughts she put in her work shows in the output. She thinks a few steps ahead for the VPs she reports to, and supplies them with exactly what they need. I can go on and on about her, but just want to give you a snapshot of the kind of people Musk just laid off. I truly believe everything happens for a reason; when one door closes, many others will open. You are exactly where you need to be, whether you are reading this post, or whether you are one just like Rachel. If you know anyone in your network who is ready to hire, please contact Rachel. I hope this post could lead to new, everlasting friendships and exciting opportunities.  #peoplefirst

As #TwitterLayoffs happen today (and more broadly layoffs across multiple industries at this time of year), seemingly with little empathy baked into the "plan", a few reminders:1. There are better and worse ways to do this kind of thing. I'm sure they weren't perfect, but Airbnb's in 2020 springs to mind as a pretty good case study on the "better" side.2. You are more than your job. Your worth and identity is not connected to it.3. Remember that this kind of thing is rarely tied to your performance. You could be at the top of the pack and still your number gets called. Try not to sweat it or overthink it, and prioritize your mental health accordingly. 4. Your job will never love you back.5. When you're a leader, communicator or otherwise who has to help execute something like this -- just put yourself in their shoes and do what you can to bake empathy and compassion into every step of the process. 6. With change like this can come opportunity. When you have the mental space to do so, start thinking about how to design your next chapter in a way that makes sense for you. You got this üí™Finally, following in the excellent example by Pierpaolo Maniglio, for anyone seeing this affected by layoffs, ping me if I can be of help. Grateful to all of the partners and folks from my past life as an #SMM who were always so good to me. #Layoffs #Empathy #NextPlay
-----------------------------
Could not agree more. Empathy and dignity are the most important elements for companies to exude in times like these. It appears that several companies have forgotten that their #employerbrand is just as important (if not more important) on the way out than on the way in.

Here is a story about how to process layoffs. It takes place on a sinking ship.The Titanic, specifically.On the night the Titanic sunk, a third class passenger made it to the deck after struggling through locked gates and flooded corridors. He arrived too late. The last lifeboat, filled with second class women and children, was full. He was one of the hundreds doomed to die in the freezing ocean that night.He stood at the railing watching as the lifeboat was lowered onto the water.At the last moment, an older woman on the lifeboat grabbed him and stuffed him under her seat while the steward‚Äôs back was turned.Once they were out on the dark sea, he asked her why she saved him.She said, ‚ÄúYou are some mother‚Äôs child too.‚ÄùThe last week has been brutal for many in tech. The most painful thing about layoffs‚Äî and I speak with great authority‚Äî is feeling you were merely a resource that was discarded. But we have also seen an outpouring of help. People are reaching out, giving referrals, making connections, and affirming our human value.Remember this: despite any decisions companies have made, each human is valuable, precious, and irreplaceable. You are some parent‚Äôs child.The coming months will be difficult, but we will be sheltered by our shared humanity. Stay strong, and reach out for help when you falter.And, as always, let me know if you need my help. #tech #layoffs #layoff #empathy

We are seeing so many layoffs this week. It's scary out there and my heart goes out to everyone who has been impacted. My advice as a recruiter: Reach out to as many recruiters as you can. Why?1. We have access to job listings that are not public2. Our job is to find jobs for you, meaning the more recruiters that have your information, the more sets of eyes you have on the job market3. When you apply to a role through a recruiter, your information gets put directly into the hiring manager's hands, rather than lost in a sea of online applicationsIf you have been impacted by a layoff and are in the #marketing, #creative, or #digital spaces, drop me a line.

Layoffs are tough but the way Twitter is handling the process is horrible.  A personal interaction, a moment of care and a show of empathy are what people need when receiving bad news. The "treat those as you would like to be treated" saying seems to be one of the past. People need to do better when dealing with other people.

The layoff problem we see across tech is not a new problem,¬†but we're seeing it with increased frequency in the #futureofwork At the core of the problem is an imbalance of full-time and flexible talent.¬†That's why I made it¬†HireScale's mission to "help technology employers¬†balance the need for both full-time and flexible workers, while also supporting the ongoing mobility of talent¬†in a constantly fluctuating hiring market".We do this through a hiring platform that includes a global talent marketplace, future-of-work job board and a vendor hub. Now, companies can better balance hiring with access to vetted profiles of FTE's, freelancers, consultants, agencies and vendors all-in-one place.There's good talent to be had. Companies just have to think outside of the box and stop getting into these predicaments where they over hire FTE's.Are you ready to balance hiring and solve the layoff problem once and for all?üö´ #layoffs

Hey #Byju‚Äôs, I decoded the hidden message in your CEO‚Äôs letter. Let me know if I got that right? Encryped: I hope you (laid off employee) will trust me when I say I tried my best to save your position. Bringing you back by putting our company on a sustainable growth path will be the number one priority for me. Deciphered: I hope you (laid off employees) will trust me when I say I am doing my best by paying 7 million dollars/ year to our new ambassador, even after reporting 20x losses in FY21. In the name of sustainable growth or inspiring millions of people to dream bigger, I assure you, my priorities remains unchanged of keeping up with the unfair practices, sell products at hefty prices to powerless parents in their name of their child‚Äôs bright future.

Once, a pack of dogs was running behind a man. He feared them, his eyes clearly reflected how dreaded he felt! Apprehensive of being charged at and bitten - he kept running. The pack followed him and finally as he got tired running one of the dogs bit him.In another instance, another pack was running behind a girl. The girl stopped looking at the dogs with a beaming smile, she gently patted. The dogs lost their rage and started playing with the girl!It's the same with our problems and worries, the more we run away, the more they haunt us and finally when we lose our strength to run further we are trapped. On the other hand, those who face challenges head on, tend to get closer to success much faster. This also enables a better mind space and quicker solution-ing!If you're going through a tough phase(read layoffs) and think you're in the midst of a pool of problems try tackling them one at a time.

Great article, written by a fantastic tech recruiter. Aaron Backman Recruiting needs to stay human peeps. ESPECIALLY with the inhumane way that layoffs are taking place. 1. Stop making your interview process so terrible that it demoralizes people. The Key word there is PEOPLE. (You aren't saying what you think you are saying for your brand when you do this)2. Humans don't fit in boxes. There are WAY too many factors. Neurodivergance, cultural nuances, anxiety. (Plus a million other factors) 3. Interviews are classically structured to reject people. As in - they are NOT structured to hire. It's a bias. Interview to hire - don't interview to reject.  Why look for the one thing someone doesn't have vs all the skills they DO HAVE? I've long said and will maintain - interviews are not the same skills as the ones you use to do your actual JOB. Let's not further traumatize those who have been laid off by making their lives hell. We can do better. #Hiring #RecruitingDifferently #PeopleMatter #LayoffsDrop me a note if I can help. I am located in Canada and while I rarely get a chance to relocate people from outside of Canada I am happy to help if I can!

In the wake of today‚Äôs #Twitter #layoffs news, I‚Äôm reminded of an insightful Arthur Brooks article in The Atlantic titled ‚ÄúA Profession is Not A Personality‚ÄùWhile it‚Äôs cool to be proud of where you work, it‚Äôs important to ensure that the ‚Äúyou‚Äù outside of the company shines brighter than the ‚Äúyou‚Äù in it.  I have seen the hardest working and most dedicated people get laid off.  I‚Äôve seen people die on their way to work and get replaced in days (true story, and super sad).  I‚Äôve also seen people who left early, took their vacay and never participated in a single ERG or company event move up the ladder because their work was undeniably top notch.Before you were a #Tweep or a Googler or whatever else your company uses to define employees, you were a human.  And you‚Äôll still be one after you leave.In the article, the author asks readers to ask themselves the questions below:Is your job the biggest part of your identity? Is it the way you introduce yourself, or even understand yourself?Do you find yourself sacrificing love relationships for work? Have you forgone romance, friendship, or starting a family because of your career?Do you have trouble imagining being happy if you were to lose your job or career? Does the idea of losing it feel a little like death to you?If you answered affirmatively to any or all of these (2 yrs ago, my answer was yes to nearly all), he invites you to employ two practices can help you reassess your priorities (read the article for more‚Ä¶).Don‚Äôt get me wrong, participating company culture isn‚Äôt a bad thing.  But we shouldn‚Äôt be more proud of where we work than who we are as humans - even if we work somewhere super cool. #career #people #balance #happiness #workculture

With all the news about #layoffs, I'm seeing lots of questions about how they can be done better, more humanely.That's a great, needed conversation given the current status quo in business - how to let people go with #dignity.The kind of mass layoffs done for "business reasons" can't be solved with more empathy, however. They are a structural feature of business logic, but ONLY WHEN "people" are viewed as overhead in the value chain. In other words, mass layoffs are a predictable feature of the way we do business these days. Anyone else think we can find a different way to do this?

Thanks, Jesse Gardner for the wonderful post. I want to add a few more points -1. Rejection doesn‚Äôt mean you are incapable. It's just that your profile does not fit the company‚Äôs needs. Please don‚Äôt beat yourself, it‚Äôs ok to accept it. Something better is waiting for you and your value will be seen.2. Focus on your learnings. Enroll in courses. (The LinkedIn learning tool is free with your library card credentials in some states)3. Like Jesse Gardner said meet with the folks virtually or in-person to exchange ideas. 4. Work on projects for which you didn‚Äôt have time in the past. 5. Help someone else find a job by using your network.6. Thanks to Mercheley Beuns-Morgan and Joe Boyle who helped me in the past to refine my interview process. And I cut down to 4-5 rounds. The interview needed to be wrapped up in 5-7 business days. What‚Äôs the point of having 10 folks asking the same questions during their rounds? Also, scheduling these many rounds will take at least one month to finish the interview process and another month to finalize the result. A humble request to the hiring manager and recruiters - the job seekers are already under stress due to recession and inflation. Please review your interview process and use Fail Fast philosophy. 1. Provide the proper agenda for the interview round.2. Have empathy and spend a few mins on providing feedback so that you can help the candidates for their next interview.3. And stop giving pain by asking why their position was eliminated from the previous organization. (The candidate doesn't fully understand know why he/she was part of that political decision)#hiring #interviewprocess #jobseekersupport #failfast #staypositive

It's very difficult to see how uncertainties are impacting a lot of employees around. Now Udaan, Stripe, BYJUS, Chargebee, Microsoft, of course Twitter and lot more Companies laying off their employees like crazily.It's so weird to see where all Companies talk about Diversity Inclusivity, Equality to be implemented, firstly Companies should start taking Empathy seriously.Today, I came to know some of my close friends got laid off and it's just unimaginable situation to go through. Just think the trauma they go through when they get laid off just like that without any notice or discussion. Anyone can get into depression or mental disturbance then who will be responsible!?I feel, any company which decides to layoff should have some plan in place as every employees has family to take care. They are not deserved to be treated like this as just take out the access or just send an email or over a quick meeting.

Musk bought Twitter. Well, not quite. In fact, this transaction is nothing more than a good'ol LBO (Leverage Buy out) which saw a large number of catastrophic deals in the 80s and 90s. Apparently, lessons are not being learned...Quote: "The frenzy of product development underlines the pressure that Mr. Musk, the world‚Äôs richest man, is under¬†to deliver immediate results¬†‚Äî and returns ‚Äî on the technology industry‚Äôs largest-ever leveraged buyout. To finance his Twitter deal, he loaded the company with $13 billion in debt, putting it on the hook to pay more than $1 billion annually in interest alone."Yep, $13B in debt and over $1B in interest payment every singled year. Trouble is, Twitter has never, like in NEVER, generated that kind of cash flow. Hence the frantic cost cutting starting today with firing 1/2 of the staff. And asking users to pay for something that has been free so far (good luck with that one :-))Three thoughts. (1) So much for being the "richest man in the world", Musk loves nothing more than OPM (Other People Money). [Space X is significantly financed by NASA...and very few people understand it] (2) LBOs have a horrendous track record. Imagine, as a CFO, starting your cash flow budget with a -$1.2B every year. What was the "President of Mars" thinking? (3) Twitter, for all its flaws, was (and I use the past tense on purpose) a worldwide "institution". A private platform that offered a universal means of communication to individuals, businesses, politicians, and...those who fought or are fighting oppression. In less than a week, Mr. Musk is well on its way to simply destroy it.Good job, kiddo!#twitter #lbo #musk #layoffs #debts https://lnkd.in/eTr5D4AF.

-----------------------------
The transformation at Twitter is something I have seen before, but I have never seen it done so quickly and methodically. What we really have here is the introduction of a new narrative; you aren't as good as you think you are.As a former software engineer (and I still write code) I know the impact of having a team come in to review your work. I know the Tesla people won't find anything in a short period of time, how could they possibly? But that's not important, the seeds of self-doubt have been sown, and not just the development team, the whole company.The veiled threats of layoffs for weeks, the RTO mandate, the code audit, all contribute to the narrative. The objective is to reduce expectations by diminishing self worth, so that ultimately payroll can be reduced. The idea that they are "getting rid of the troublemakers" is nonsense, they just want fewer people doing more work for less money. Nobody really knows that they will lay off half the company. There is nothing new about this, it is the way big business does business.Twitter people, it is a narrative. It doesn't have to be true, and in this case, it is not. Trust yourselves, and know your own truth.#twitter #layoffs

-----------------------------
It is quite evident that some companies don't get this. I believe it's sad that #layoffs have become so normal that we've become numb to this archaic process. From the moment we start our professional careers, we are instructed to always have a backup plan even when our current situation doesn't allow it.  Individuals are told to have a rainy day fund, prepare for the worst, don't pull all your eggs in one basket and countless other overused and stale clich√©s. It's about time that corporations and employers do the same. No one wants to hear "Layoffs are tough but necessary." We don't believe you anymore. Employee #burnout is at an all-time high with 79% of respondents saying they felt some sort of work related stress in a 2021 APA Work and Well-being Survey. Humans are giving everything to succeed in their careers just to be disposed of like leftovers. We need more empathetic and caring leaders. We need CEOs and Executives to care more about the people that make them rich versus the bottom line. I challenge those in power to see past quarterly numbers and actually think about those people that have bills to pay, mouths to feed, school supplies to purchase and families depending on them. We are better than this. #workerscompensation #people #careers #leaders #corporations #humancapital #empathy #leaderseatlast

Use Formatting Available in Tableau My first tip for making beautiful bar charts in Tableau is to use the formatting options you already have available in Tableau. Consider the following Sales by Category bar chart pictured to the right that shows all of the default Tableau settings. This bar chart gets the job done, as you can immediately decipher that Technology leads the way with over $800,000 in sales, Furniture contributes the second most, and Office Supplies contribute the least. However, there are several opportunities to make this bar chart more engaging and effective. The most obvious of which is to widen the columns so the categories can be read.¬†#hupry is hiring; follow the Linkedin Page for the detailsFollow #hupry üëâ¬†https://lnkd.in/eifJ6ypC#hupry #cybersecurity #privacy #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #ai #aiforgood #aiforall #ml #bigdata #datascience #dataanalytics #dataanalysis #data #datasecurity #datagovernance #financialservices #healthcare #scienceandtechnology #privacycompliance #privacycompliance #deeptech #deeplearning #devops #neuralnetworks #layoffs #layoff #engineers #java #javascript #python #mathematics

Getting laid off is HARD. I see the news from #Twitter and #Stripe and so many others and I know how difficult it can be. How do I know?Because it‚Äôs happened to me 3 different times. There‚Äôs shame, frustration, confusion, anger, and a host of other emotions that you might not have the language to identify. With that many emotions swirling, it can be difficult to find your way. So, here are a few things that helped me bounce back from a layoff.1. Reach out to your network. This one is tough because you might feel shame or embarrassment but you shouldn‚Äôt. A layoff doesn‚Äôt mean you did something wrong. It also doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt skilled and valuable. Update your LinkedIn profile to #opentowork status and go for it!2. Take advantage of the benefits. If your former employer offers ANY benefits, TAKE THEM. EAP, severance, unemployment, outplacement services etc. Don‚Äôt allow your current disdain for the organization cause you to miss the very things you need at this moment.3. Find/lean into your tribe. Now more than ever you need the love, community, and comfort of the people who care for you. Don‚Äôt stay stuck in the house behind a computer screen hitting ‚Äúapply all‚Äù on a job board. Go to that networking event. Attend that training session that was sent to your email for the 3rd month in a row. You NEED to be around people!If you have been laid off and need someone to help you navigate it, my DMs are open. #layoffs #laidoff #jobchange

The Twitter layoff is senseless. Acquiring a company after so many controversies and sacking 50% of employees in a week, looks more like a personal vendetta.

Worried about layoffs and terminations?

Companies like BYJUS should be sued, just like Twitter is getting sued that too a class action lawsuit. Laying off so many employees will make people wonder that it must be under some financial duress but Hello! Messi just got made the brand ambassador for BYJUS in FIFA  for which it is the official sponsor. It's irresponsible businesses like these which lead to unemployment, rise in crimes, suicides etc. if you cannot manage few employees to be on the payroll then it's better to PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS. For companies which are driven by people, their biggest CSR should be people driven initiatives especially their own employees.  #people #layoffs #employees #byjus

When you care about their pain, you become human. When you empathise with their journey, you become Stripe. What a class act! üëèüèª PS. Layoffs are tough and painful but when you provide avenues to help and guide, not eveything feels lost. #employeeexperience #layoffs #empathyatwork

Why do most of us give up?We expect progress to be linear, but the key aspect of any compounding process is that the outcome is delayed.Initially, we don't feel like we are making progress, as the results don't follow the linear trajectory that we expect, and we give up.But the magic happens after crossing the threshold!One of my favorite book - "Atomic Habits"Book recommendations are welcomed.#jamesclear #atomichabits #book #layoffs #recession

It's real grimey to lay off employees before the holidays.  Especially in THIS economy.Some companies really are soulless.#layoffs #economy #inflation #jobsearch #stripe #twitter #dobetter

Layoff mindsets, not people. It is definitely possible to build a lean organization with empathy and sound principles forming the bedrock. Organizations and their leaders indeed need to think about the actual growth possible and not blatantly increase the company's headcount by hiring loads of people when the markets are rosy. Instead the current workforce should be empowered enough to turn "projections" into "actuals" first. This way the existing workforce grows vertically and creates more avenues for organically adding more human capital. This way the employees themselves provide a hedge for their employment, a buffer which can be really crucial for growth crusades of the organization.In all, the advent of labeling human capital as "flab" in bad times and the debacle of "leadership" is indeed disturbing. Organizations must not forget that in long term, their intrinsic worth is directly correlated with the human capital they could get, hone and grow. #people #leadership #twitter #elonmusk #byjus #layoffs #recession #thoughtleadership #startup #entrepreneurship #leaders

It's really astounding to see how the social media universe works...While all of the negative emotions are being amplified with all the news of #layoffsA consequence of that is the increased virality of #linkedinAnd there is an article on the curated LinkedIn #news that is headlined:"Canada's jobs boom beats estimates"LinkedIn - Is it feasible to have a feature request to measure the success of #opentowork posts by those that are laid off by capturing their time to find their next Job?We are displaying vanity badges of # of engagement on our posts, and "LinkedIn" helped me get this Job.It would be good to measure the impact of the posts specifically looking for jobs by:1. When the individual has their next role updated on LinkedIn2. The time to get the job since the #opentowork post3. The number of roles that are true "LinkedIn Helped them to get the next Job"Instead of the engagement metrics based on comments and reactions.#RnD

There's been so much news of mass layoffs in tech firms this week. Ironically, i was notified on #linkedin to congratulate over 20 people starting a new job this week as well. This is just to remind us that there are two phases to life, the good and bad, the positive and negative, the acceptance and rejection.... Irrespective of what condition you find yourself today, stay motivated, get better, and be optimistic.#tech #job #people #layoffs #employment

Massive layoffs for Twitter. Soon after, Twitter is being sued under a California Law for not giving enough notice of mass layoffs. It'll be interesting to watch the verdict and how new Twitter handles this. If you're an ex Twitter employee, how do you feel about this? For all those affected, I hope you find another gig soon!

Layoffs are not easy.They can be life-altering, scary events that can leave you feeling vulnerable, confused, and even depressed. And it's hard not to feel that way when you're the one who's being let go.But remember:You are not alone in this! There are millions of people out there who have been through layoffs and come out on the other side stronger than ever before. You might be surprised by how many people you know who have experienced a layoff at some point in their careers and how many of them have thrived after the experience!So here are some tips to help you get through your layoff:1) Don't panic! Take some time off if necessary, but don't stay away from work for too long you'll lose valuable network contacts and opportunities to learn new skills.2) Keep your spirits up by staying active in other areas of your life, such as volunteering or taking courses. It can also help to talk with friends or family members who have gone through similar experiences themselves. Don't forget about fun distractions like music or movies whatever makes you laugh!#experience #chime #opportunities #careers #help #network #like #work #twitter #layoffs #hiring

Elon Musk fires almost all of India‚Äôs staffü§Øüê¶ After the completion of the $44 billion deal last week, Musk fired top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal along with legal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to a WS] report.üê¶Several top executives including CMO Leslie Berland also left the company after the firing of top executives.üê¶The company had nearly 250 employees in India.Twitter employees globally received an email at around 4am IST on 4 November, informing them that they will lose access to Twitter's internal systems, like Slack, emails etc., if their role is impacted by the downsizing.üê¶The first round of layoffs at Twitter started Friday following a formal email sent by the company on Thursday that reportedly asked workers across the globe to stay at home and wait for another email that will update them about the status of their job.üê¶Further, sources confirmed that people from Twitter's Curation team, which curates content for the Twitter Moments feature, have been let go. üê¶Other teams affected include Communications, Global Content Partnerships, Sales and Ad Revenue, Engineering and Product. All or at least 50% of employees in these teams have been let go.üê¶An ex-employee, who was among the ones laid off, said that some contractual employees who weren't on full time company rolls have also been retained.Follow Sagar Bandodkar for more üíπ#twitter #job #people #india #elonmusk #layoffs #finance

A week‚Äôs notice for a mass layoff is a violation under CA employment law. If you‚Äôre an employee at Twitter or have colleagues there, and you all are impacted by this mass layoff ‚Äî know your rights ‚Äî contact an employment lawyer immediately (they‚Äôre expecting your call). üìö üí¥ ‚ÄúWARN protects employees, their families, and communities by requiring employers to give a 60-day notice to the affected employees and both state and local representatives before a plant closing or mass layoff. Advance notice provides employees and their families time to transition and adjust to the potential loss of employment, time to seek alternative jobs and, if necessary, time to obtain skills training or retraining to successfully compete in the job market.‚Äù(https://lnkd.in/gZ4AbYVM)#employmentlaw #knowyourrights #california #layoffs #warn #leadershipcoaching #executivecoaching

So Messi is the official brand ambassador of Byju. That‚Äôs Remarkable! Celebrity endorsement has always been the backbone of marketing from many years. Grabbing them into the bucket requires millions and millions to be invested. Specially if the personality is an international star. For #byjus it was earlier #srk and now they added on #lionelmessi to multiply their reach to international market. The amount of followers they enjoy can boost the sales for any organization for sure. But considering the opposite ,as per the updates from company 2500 jobs being cut and many more will be laid off in the coming quarters. So shouldn‚Äôt the company spend some bucks on maintaining that too? #jobs #sales #brand #marketing #leo #messi #globalbusiness #byjus #shahrukhkhan #startup #ecosystem #marketing #strategies #layoffs

Hand Wringing In The IT Space Needs Company By Company AnalysisToday's mixed report that the #US #labor market added more than a quarter million jobs but had #unemployment rise should indicate that some will maintain historical #demand, while others will suffer downsizing driven by market conditions. In my view, easy debt financing was the real culprit for specific types of #layoffs. These layoffs involve companies that overestimated demand peaks lasting well into next year (or needed demand to extend that far into the future) and over hired to avoid an opportunity cost in a historically hot consumer market.¬†Despite the recent push for RTO, my suspicion is that everyone whose worth a decent salary still has leverage in their own way provided that they know the inner workings of their industry.¬†[...]#jobs #future My point is specifics matter. Look under the hood because no one is going to do it for you. Personally, I‚Äôm tired of companies acting broke when they‚Äôre not and rich when they‚Äôre in debt.https://lnkd.in/eHQZmrY9

At least 50% of my feed is saturated with news of layoffs. Perhaps that is just the algorithm attempting to predict my behavior (a mental health issue for another time). Yet, the sheer volume of posts seems to indicate otherwise. It is gut-wrenching, particularly in those cases where the accessibility community is impacted or where a parent is worried about feeding their children.Been there.I started my career at T-Mobile. I knew the role and my team was special from the get. I was committed, a top-performer, die-hard champion for my colleagues (and friends). There was a 0% possibility that I would ever leave. Loyalty is important to me.And then there was a merger. That ambiguous meeting with HR in my calendar. And many, many tears soon to follow. Felt like 5 years of accomplishment evaporated in 5 seconds. It was a difficult time but ended up igniting my career in ways I didn't think possible. At T-Mobile, my time was split between accessibility and financial services where after a couple of years I yearned for full-time focus on accessibility. I had my attorney license and had always wanted to practice disability rights law. So I did that. I had a curiosity about the technical side of accessibility. So I did that next. I then landed a role that is my most organic fit yet and with a team that is beyond my wildest dreams.This would have never happened if that layoff did not occur. If you are able, my support to you would be to use this as an excuse to ignite your passions. Explore. Stretch yourself. Fold into your truth and lean hard into your strengths. Challenge fear. You are devastated. You are tired. Burned out. I know. Yet, I sincerely hope that you wake up 2 years later with gratitude for everything that happened to get you where you are today.If I can pass along a recommendation or connect you with somebody at Spectrum who is hiring, please use me. As for my team, we are looking for a college student with a passion for accessibility. We will train and mentor.

Volkswagen has recommended to its brands to pause paid advertising on TwitterVolkswagen on Friday said it has recommended to its brands to pause paid advertising on Twitter until further notice in the wake of Elon Musk's takeover of the social media platform, accoring to Reuters. https://reut.rs/3UrsTVy"We are closely monitoring the situation and will decide about next steps depending on its evolvement," Europe's top carmaker said in a statement.The comments by Volkswagen group, which covers the VW, Seat, Cupra, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, Ducati and Porsche brands, echoes similar remarks from other firms, including GM and General Mills Inc. #twittertakeover #elonmusktwitter #layoffs #volkswagen #gm

I know that more and more #layoffs are occurring. I wanted to take a moment to say, stay positive! Yes it hurts to have a job one moment and not have one a moment later. #connect with the LinkedIn community. Reach out to old connections and make new ones. Redefine what you are looking for. As for me, I decided it was time to find a company that had the same goals as me. Building a #bestinclass centralized Talent Acquisition department is high on my list. I can say that I have interviewed with some companies that I was not interested in working for them. Today, I interviewed with a company and I am throughly excited for the next steps in the #interview process. #reach  for the stars, #pray for guidance and above all:Stay #positive and #active !!

Click on this link.Scroll down the page. Look at the list.And yet...we are still doing mass layoffs across the U.S.And no one is surprised at who the highest paid CEO is, are they???WHO NEEDS THAT MUCH MONEY??? Sending a "heartfelt" email to employees letting them know they will soon be out of a job, how it's necessary due to blah, blah, blah, and all the things the company is going to do for them because they're being laid off...When you're making in one month more than what some of them make in a year - come on! That really doesn't help when they have:- Mortgages- Car payments - Food expenses- Utility expenses- Daycare expenses- College tuitionAnd (often) families to take care of.  This is so "bass ackwards" and it needs to change. Look...I'm not trying to be a jerk. I'm not saying CEOs don't have a hard job. They do. And they deserve to be paid what they're worth. But remember...without employees (human beings) putting in the work - you would have no company to run.#CEO #Corporation #Companies #Leaders #Leadership #Jobs #Careers #Employees #Layoffs #DoTheRightThing #LivedExperience #EmployeesArePeople #Humanity #DoBetter #BeBetter

Topic: Jobs | Layoffs | Employees | Experience ‚Äú After a layoff, survivors experienced a 20% decline in job performance.‚Äù - Harvard Business Review One of the biggest questions organizations face as they grapple with a constantly shifting economic landscape is whether their current workforce can help them make the transitions necessary to their success. While companies tend to prioritize short-term financial results over the long-term well-being of their employees, employees are the lifeblood that enables a company to keep delivering the products and services that ultimately generate shareholder benefits. Michelin‚Äôs and Nokia‚Äôs experiences show that employees can and should be trusted to perform well, even when they know they might lose their jobs. For all companies, planning thoughtful workforce change instead of automatically resorting to layoffs is a better way to address the vicissitudes of technological transformation and intensifying competition.According to HBR- Having a clear methodology will allow companies to explore alternatives to layoffs, and if they cannot be avoided, minimize the harm they cause. To establish one, firms need to address three questions:üìçHow will we plan for workforce change on an ongoing basis?üìçWho will be accountable for managing and supervising it?üìçWhat metrics should we use to determine whether our actions are effective? #business #planning #employeeexperience #retentionstrategy #longtermvalue #layoffs #recession #recruitment #contracting #consulting #job #employeeengagement

Twitter warns of layoffs coming Friday.#Twitteremployees will find out whether they still have their jobs at 9 a.m. PT #Friday, according to an internal email seen by The Wall Street Journal. The email, sent Thursday, tells employees of the #socialmedia platform that the cuts are needed to "place #Twitter on a healthy path." Twitter employs around 7,500 people; Bloomberg News reported earlier in the week that the reductions would affect around 3,700 employees ‚Äî about half of the company. Meanwhile, Twitter is facing a class-action lawsuit filed Thursday by current or former employees who say the company has given insufficient notice of the cuts under state and federal law.  #elonmusk¬†#management¬†#advertising¬†#roas #layoffs #employmentlaw #news¬†#jobcuts ¬†#elonmusktwitter¬†#elon
