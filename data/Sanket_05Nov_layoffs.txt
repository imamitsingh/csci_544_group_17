NEW: A Twitter engineer manager was part of Twitter’s layoffs while on leave. He wasn’t on vacation though, he was taking care of his son who’s battling cancer. He is among thousand of other people who have been laid off in heartbreaking circumstances.Read the full article at Business Insider. #twitter #elonmusktwitter #layoffs

What a wild week! Sadly, my role at #Lyft was impacted by the recent #layoffs, one month before my 6th anniversary with the company. I was not alone, and I am sending all my support to my fellow Lyft team members who were let go too.The news came just 4 days before I was set to return to work from a sabbatical. I landed back in Los Angeles only a few days before, excited to get back to my team, but unfortunately I won't able to do that. Lyft regularly checked in with its employees, and the recurring answer I gave to the question "what's your favorite part about working at Lyft?" was "the people."Each of my team members and the numerous cross-functional partners I worked with made Lyft a great place to grow, and together we produced some really awesome things. I am forever thankful to my badass friends and coworkers, my managers who continually pushed, challenged, and advocated for me, and the XFN partners who went out of their way to teach me a new skill or answer a random slack question.I'm sure I'll go through a wide range of emotions over the next few weeks, but my primary feelings right now are excitement and positivity. I'm enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities in Los Angeles or in a remote capacity, and am grateful for all the amazing work I was able to do with Lyft to set me up for future success.Thanks for reading! Please reach out if I can help with your job search in any way, or just want to hop on a call and gab for 30 minutes. #OpenToWork

I applaud Stripe Executives and the way they owned the decisions leading to this point.  Also, it says a lot about them as leaders who are good “senders”.  I feel for the folks losing their jobs and I hope the severance packages you received will lessen the blow while you figure out what is next for you!

Thursday morning I woke up to an email with the subject, “Raneen, Your Role at Stripe,” and I knew what was coming next. Although impacted by the #layoffs, my Role at Stripe went beyond fighting financial crimes. My Role at Stripe was helping people feel like they were truly part of an extraordinary team and organization. It was building a new community for my fellow MENA colleagues to feel safe, seen, and heard at a place they spend more than half of their days at. It was creating and fostering partnerships that have turned into lifelong friendships. My Role at Stripe was so much more than the work I produced and it was so special. My 3 year journey there is one I will remember forever. I am sure you’ve all seen the same message from my insanely talented fellow colleagues also impacted, but it truly is the brilliant people at Stripe that make this sting a little less. I greatly appreciate the outpour of love and support I’ve been receiving, and I’m excited for the next chapter in my career as I’m #opentowork once again.

To those Lyft, Stripe, Gem, Twitter, and all the other companies that have recently been laid off, I was scrolling through posts this morning after doing some applications and found this video by Dante Alvarado-Leon about his story being laid off by Airbnb in 2019. Layoffs are tough and they bring a lot of tough emotions this helped me continue to stay focused with conviction. I am choosing to see this as an opportunity to singularly focus on what's next and how I want to contribute to the world.I have been astonished by the outpouring of support from former work fam, friends, and family over the last several days. I really have seen how lucky am to have such a network of caring passionate people!

To those who are helping the Twitter folks get back on their feet, great work, folks! (And all the others who have been laid off in the industry)To those who used their platform to kick people while they're down, that reflects solely on you. What an awful place to be in.#layoffs

To all the incredible people waking up with a layoff hangover today, I know how it feels. I was part of the Uber layoffs in 2020. At the time, it felt like nothing made sense. I didn't know what to do next. Looking back now, it may have been the best thing that happened to me. It gave me the courage and freedom to pursue my dream of starting a company, forced me to prioritize what's most important to me (family), and opened up so many doors I hadn't even imagined. I know with certainty that the same will happen for each of you in the coming months. You are among the best in the world. Never forget that. Take some time to recharge and then get after it. My DMs are open for anyone that wants to chat / vent / seek advice.#layoffs #talent #dontgiveup

Hi friends ~ This morning I received an email that I was impacted by Gem's layoffs which impacted 1/3 of our workforce, including our entire Early Talent team.  Having only been at Gem for about 4 months, this feels kind of wild to me. But being at a startup like Gem and with my BEYOND amazing Early Talent crew (S/O to Charlene Delapena, Diana Ogbevire and Gaia Uman Borrero for showing me what a dream team truly feels like), it felt like much longer and I am so grateful for the amount of process and resource building I was able to own during my time here. 💛This is a hard time with the holidays being around the corner and the uncertainty of everything, but I'm hopeful that things will work out in the end. So if you or anyone you know is hiring for University Recruiting Program Manager roles, please don't hesitate reach out! #OpentoWork #UniversityRecruiting #ProgramManager #Layoffs #Opportunities #JobSearch

There’s this lovely specimen who is completely out of touch with humans. Empathy will always win! 🤷‍♀️ He wrote a post yesterday about how software engineers at Twitter deserve to be laid off.Then he went on about how much money they make and he doesn’t feel badly for them.They’ll be fine. Really? How does he know? THEN he’s upset when people react and tell him he’s callous and without empathy. Oh and his headline says aspiring doctor and follower of Jesus 😂 How’s that empathy working?He decided after to troll my DM’s today and tell me he thought of me when he wrote his post today. Here’s the thing:  You post on social media and write a callous post for engagement — you get it. Here’s the thing: You’re entitled to your opinion and I’m entitled to tell you sound like you like a person who need a dose of kindness. Here’s the thing:NO ONE deserves to be laid off. Unless they haven’t done their job. Then fire them.But layoffs ARE part of business. So can empathy be. Here’s the thing: To drag people through the mud, no matter what their salary was..  deserves to be called out. I’m no social justice warrior changing the world.. But I will always stand up for those who have been wronged and speak my mind. Just like this lovely human speaks his. And if people don’t like my opinions? They’re free to disagree.  Just don’t come at me in DM’s. Stand up for what’s right. Be a good human.#twitter #layoffs #lovewhereyouwork #empathy

Layoffs suck - no matter how they come. But you know what makes them suck more? Leaders not owning up to the mistakes they made and the bad decisions they made to get the company to where it was that led to that layoff. Layoffs typically equal leaders not planning correctly or being overly optimistic about their own success. If you are a leader who has to do a layoff - remember to do the following:1)  Take ownership of your bad decisions. Be vulnerable and authentic - and please don't BS people. They can see right through that. 2) Know that even though it sucks for you, it really sucks for the lives of the people you are laying off because you are taking food off of their table. And food away from their families. 3) Know that the rest of your employees are going to be scared and unsettled for a while. 4) Don't make your HR team deliver this news. You made these decisions - you deliver the news. Be brave enough to do it - BUT ask HR for help. And make sure you give them enough time to prep. DON'T be the a**hole that gives them a week to fire hundreds of people. 5) Don't do this via a large Zoom or emails. Meet with people individually - even if it takes weeks. And yes, even if you have to have leadership and HR help you do these individual meetings. 6) DON'T HIRE new EXECUTIVES during the time you are doing layoffs. This is a really bad look - it makes you look idiotic and it really makes it seem like you don't know what you are doing or how to spend company money appropriately. 7) Give those laid-off employees severance and time - they will need a few weeks just to deal with this news. And during times of recession, it takes people longer to find jobs. Also give them resources to find other jobs and tap into your network. 8) On that same note, your role as a leader who decided to lay off these employees should be to find each and every one of them their next job - so that should be your #1 priority for a few weeks. 9) If you aren't ready to do ALL of these things - and constantly talk to your HR team for advice and guidance (they've done this before and chances are, you haven't) - then DON'T MAKE BAD DECISIONS TO WHERE IT LANDS YOU INTO LAYOFF TERRITORY!!! Above all - don't be the jacka** that sheds a tear on LinkedIn, saying how it was super hard for you as a CEO to let people go. Get ahold of yourself and have some self-awareness.#leaders #layoffs

LinkedIn has become a pretty macabre place. Restructurings and layoffs have reminded us we're little more than numbers in a spreadsheet. But there are still lights in the dark! Those same numbers are banding together to help where they can, when they can, how they can.Though it's been two years since I was laid off from a "we're one big family" agency who "wasn't going to lay anyone off due to covid slowdowns", there's still lots of tips I found useful.Here's hoping it can do the same for you.Thank you, Nicole!  #help #layoffs

It is hard when a place you love lets you down. I got laid off 2x this year, and it sucks big time.One thing I wish that people would have told me is that the choice to have layoffs is not about me directly. I am a great woman, and I can do anything that I set my mind to. Take the weekend or more time to work through those feelings. When you are ready, get back up and start punching down those walls. 👊👊👊 You might be surprised to get an even better opportunity at the end of it all. #layoffs #twitter #stripe #opportunity #hopeful

I can't thank everyone enough for their outpouring of support and well wishes. I know I'm in good company right now both at Lyft  and amid an unprecedented number of #layoffs. I have an amazing support network that I couldn't possibly be more grateful for.In the meantime I thought I might spend my newly found free time doing some #volunteer work instead of doomscrolling LinkedIn all day. I'll be looking specifically at any political organizations who might need a hand post election wrap-up or otherwise. I have extensive administration skills, worked for several years at the non profit Los Angeles LGBT Center and I'm also currently wrapping up a masters at Harvard in International Relations. If anyone in my network knows of someone who might need a hand, please let me know!

I am not rich. Not Gates and Buffett rich (yet). So I cannot make an impact with the giving pledge (yet...)But I do care deeply about how many of our peers are impacted by layoffs. So I want to start a new pledge. A "get rehired" pledge. Please join meIf you want to, comment here with the words "DM me for (sales, or marketing, or engineering) jobs" Imagine the impact; if a 1,000 committed to getting 3,000 rehiredWhat is the "get rehired" pledge? Get at least 3 people who have been impacted by layoffs rehired * Spend 30 minutes daily connecting people to jobs * Do not simply commit to providing coaching (which is very valuable) * Commit to connecting laid-off candidates with specific jobs* To get 3 people hired, you need to engage with some multiple of 3... lets say 30 peopleSo... DM me for sales jobsRight now I am aware of 5-10 openings for senior sellers who have managed global and key accounts. Please have any seller in your network who has been impacted by layoffs reach out to me. They must * understand how technology enables business* know what it means to work back from customers' needs#getrehiredpledge #layoffs #salesjobs #givingpledge

Amidst the chaotic debate of "Moonlighting" seen as unethical, non-loyal and even illegal by many corporates in the recent past, the unplanned and the sudden layoffs by the same fraternity may well, on the contrary, become one of the most important drivers of the same!Reciprocity of sensitivity is an important indicator of longevity, esp. in case of employment! Unfortunately, the increasing deficit in trust may well be the norm! Thoughts?#layoffs #moonlighting

Recently laid off and your mood's a bit low?  Try something new and snack on greens instead of processed food.  I also recommend taking 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar mixed in 1 tablespoon of water, then a quick water back two times a day.

The Twitter layoffs are tough to see. If you were in Elon Musk's position, what would you have done differently? 🤔Let me know your thoughts in the comments below 👇#twitterlayoffs #layoffs
-----------------------------
Imagine if #elonmusk was apart of a #mergersandacquisitions hunt for a #cannabis brand? How would the public perceive it? #layoffs aside because that's already happening heavily in this industry, would he be much better than if #jeffbezos had free prime delivery with the purchase of an eighth or more over $50? The #cannabisindustry is at a critical point right now. The cashflow has slowed and major #celebrities have become the main attraction.How does that REALLY help the industry? i applaud Cresco Labs and Columbia Care for being a part of a bigger moment than just  #diddy now owning a huge chunk of reality in the #mso space. What this means to me is that now more than ever there is a put up or shut up moment. Will this REALLY help increase #inclusivity  and #diversity ? How will this #aquisition help the brand? Will the #quality be there? Will the #marketing  and #branding  be as on point as the companies that aim to the #cannabisculture? all this is yet to be seen. This move could be critical for #socialequity in the industry. On the celebrity side, if this works out with Diddy then i really wouldn't be surprised if #elon looks to add to his portfolio #elonmusktwitter #corporate #cannabiscommunity #cannabisbusiness

Hearing about layoffs in the tech industry that affect your friends and colleagues is always hard. I would encourage all those affected to take their time to think about their next role and look at what companies align with their values and where opportunities are available for them to achieve their goals!That being said, I recently joined Atlassian and it's been awesome so far. The company is open with no BS, puts customers first, and has an inspiring mission. My team within Confluence is growing, and there are some hard problems that need to be solved for us to help all teams work better together! For those looking for a new role and who are ready to take on their next opportunity, I would encourage you to consider Atlassian and this role!#hiring #team #tech #layoffs #twitter #lyft #stripe

Having focusing on my craft and career for going on three decades, I’ve had my share of layoffs, restructurings and simple “we’re done with your contract.” There were a few I did not see coming. A few I had a gut feeling. A few that while they may have been forced on me, were blessings in disguise. For those who are at that crossroads due to #layoffs and #restructuring know that this is nothing personal although not having a job and being able to support one’s family makes it highly personal! I’ve been restructured with $60 in my bank account, an abuser who refused to work, and needing to take care of my daughter. But… also know that this LI platform can provide you with so many networking opportunities. Be open to everything and all. And if I can help make introductions or simply answer questions or just be emotional support, I’m here.

I have a short list of DOs and DON’Ts for any young people or underrepresented folks who were laid off this week, mainly because I have been part of a mass layoff in the past myself. Even if you were not impacted by a layoff, please share with folks who you think might benefit from reading this.This post is focused on emotional well-being, but I’m also happy to help folks get connected to work opportunities independently. Leave a comment below for my network to see you were affected and are open to roles. 0) Before I start: You GOT this. It’s hard, but you can get through it. Other people have been where you are and have experienced this pain. You are not alone. Rely on your friends and connections. You got this.1) DO extend yourself a lot of self compassion right now. This is your NUMBER ONE JOB. Talk to people who see how amazing you are. Listen to former colleagues who tell you you were doing an awesome job. Make a list of what you do well, what people have always said you do well. 2) DON’T look for feedback about what you didn’t do well: yes, sure, it’s good to get feedback and become better but NOW IS NOT THE TIME to seek feedback or see what you could have done to avoid being laid off. A great time to get feedback is when you are in a steady place and have people who care about you tell you what you are doing well and how you could do even better. Almost all the women I talked to this week wanted to know what they could have done or should improve to avoid this in the future. No, again, now is NOT the time. 3) DO accept the somewhat arbitrary nature of life in general. We each get lucky and unlucky all the time. We want to be in a fair and just world where everything is optimized and people get rewarded only based on merit. Some of us work very hard to make the world (and our workplaces) that way. But the world is not fair, not just because of malice (there is of course malice in the world) but also because even good, well meaning people don’t have full information when they make decisions that impact lives, so they don’t have perfect judgement. Systems are not set up perfectly, and there is often not enough time to make the process optimal. I have seen companies layoff their best, most productive people. I personally have not been involved in any layoff decision making in my career but this is what I have gleaned: Layoffs are not surgical, they are fast and probably crude with big brush strokes. The main logic is cutting cost. 4) DON’T question your worth or blame yourself. If your company was not able to keep you, it’s on THEM not you. They gave up because they couldn’t afford you. 5) DO talk to more experienced folks who have seen or been through layoffs. They can give you perspective. (Only nice people though, don’t talk to jerks, like ever).Finally, I repeat: YOU GOT THIS!! ♥️♥️♥️#layoffs #underrepresented #womenintech

Instead of being mere keyboard warriors around the massive insensitive layoffs happening in certain organizations, here's something tangible that we all can do.- Boycott the offerings of those orgs > There's no point saying the layoffs were unethical or what the leadership did was unethical. Just quietly withdraw your support from the product/platform/service and let them deal with one less customer. Withdrawing support can be in the form of not paying for the offerings anymore, become inactive etc.- Help people who actually were asked to go > This can be in the form of referrals if there are relevant job openings in your org, liking/commenting/sharing their open to work posts, tagging them on posts where the authors are inviting companies to post relevant job vacancies, meeting in person (if possible) to provide mental support etc.- Make enough noise around the unacceptance of such opportunistic culture > Through your preferred medium like social media, word of mouth etc. make enough noise to condemn such acts. Remember, every authentic voice counts.- Remember the incident > In this era of information overload, it's often very easy to forget the bad stuff as much as the good stuff. One PR masterstroke or one influencer post, our memory of a bad incident gets wiped out in a jiffy. Hence, it's important to remember how a company treated its employees during tough times (recession, covid etc.) and lookout for red flags if you plan on joining such a workplace.I have started with steps 1 and 3 of my own suggestions. My firm belief is that times may be tough, but humans are tougher. May everyone who got affected by the layoffs see the light at the end of the tunnel soon!#layoffs #randompositivity

These days I see layoffs news everywhere. Major tech companies are doing cost cutting by trimming down the team.The market is pretty bad for IT industry. The layoff trend will continue. Don't feel bad if you are relieved from the company. You can always find a good alternative. If you are struggling, then utilise this time to do self introspection and hone your skills. #layoffs #twitter
-----------------------------
Employee Lay Offs become a fashion now a days to cut costs which is the 5% of over all costs to an organization. Mergers and acquisitions mandate such things without using any logics. Employees build the organization, they put their best during trouble times to keep the organization floating.  Lay offs are not end off road to an employee, its a temporary set back. Focus on your strengths and  work on your networking skills. You will definitely bounce back. #layoffs #employeeexperience

I think is a good time to remember that being laid-off doesn't make you a less competitive person in the market. Nor makes you less valuable.Is important to be kind to yourself during these times, and understand that some things aren't related to you, but are more related to your past employers and the market situation. Take your time to let it sink, and feel the emotions you need. Being laid off is not something that doesn't affect you, I'm sure of it. Especially when is all so sudden.Let's combine forces as a community to reach out to those who are going through a hard time, share their profiles with the world and hiring companies, and especially, just listen and help them process this.A big hug to those who are going through this hard process.#hiring #community #layoffs #mentalhealth

#Twitter #layoffs “Musk” he is crazy… Don’t know, it’s a right or wrong decision???

"Money begets money", is one of the most terrible aspects of the capitalistic world. Recently Byjus, laid off 5% of their workforce to maintain profitability yet they have enough to shell out a fortune to rope in Lionel Messi, as their ambassador, who for one is not Indian and for two has nothing to do with Education, yet they believe that his inclusion is going to help in their so-called goal of better education to all. On the other hand, we have the recent example of Elon Musk and his billion $ baby Twitter. Ever since he made that purchase, he is making changes to it like it's the end of the world. From sacking management to laying off employees to charging verified accounts, he has been acting like that fanatic kid who was made the king of an empire, and he has gone absolutely haywire. I am lured into calling him the modern-day, Ivan - The Terrible. And all this, he is doing when he says that his motto is to provide a free platform to all. This is not about, Byjus or Twitter, Musk, or even those employees. This is about something even bigger. This is about the time you all realize how the world works under a capitalist regime. Capitalism aims at producing an abstract called value for another abstract called shareholders. If anything, it has the least to do with world problems. They not only want to not see them, but are willing to worsen them if anything if that brings them the bait, called " value" they are after. It's about time all you realize that this has been like this forever and it will continue to be forever, if not you realize what is actually important. It's incumbent on you all out there to understand what's right and what is just. It's high time everyone starts to call out what is wrong and not just be a mere spectator.#layoffs#twitter

I, along with many others who questioned her audacity and shamelessness, had put some comments on her post. After that, she activated the option on her profile that can just make her connections post a comment on this stupid post of hers. Maybe, tomorrow she ends up deleting our comments and blocking us, hence sharing her post and my comment on my profile. Here it goes:“I would want you to go and take a look at yourself in the mirror. If you aren’t ashamed of what inhumane things you are doing in BYJUs, trust me, you will be. Not too far in time, I hope. I usually don’t write such things on LinkedIn and I might just pretend that there’s nothing personal, but goddamnit, it seems personal to me despite the fact I wasn’t one of your employees who was consumed by your lay-off wildfire.

Have always loved the mission Elon puts himself in be it artificial intelligence, space race, clean energy etc.. But this act of laying off 50% of workforce overnight can't be justified in any way.. Giving 3 months of severance would help up but job finding would be still difficult for them With the recession on its way it would be more tougher.What do you think ?  #twitter #layoffs #hiring

I find myself in a nebula of possibility left in the aftermath of a career supernova 💥 I was just hit by a wave of lay offs caused by Audible and Amazon's hiring pause. Thursday morning seemed like a normal day, but by 2pm I was told that it was my last day, that there would be no severance, that PTO was not paid out, and that my health benefits would end. All right before the holidays, and days after I spent a huge chunk of my last check on rent, utilities, insurance, etc...Maybe it's a sign to move into the next chapter of my life? Maybe I double down on recruiting even though I just sorta... fell into it? Maybe I get something part time, go back to school and set myself up for a new career? My world is spinning all too fast. I need time to process everything while pressure mounts to get back into something ASAP to keep the lights on... Here... We... Go!Anyone have advice? Counsel? Experience with this? I'd love to chat! #layoffs #careertransition #newbeginnings #Audible #opentowork #opentolife #opentogrowthP.S. To all the candidates I left behind with Audible - I wish we could have closed the loop, but things happened too fast. Best of luck in your job search!

Maybe it's me ... but rings hollow hearing founders (themselves millionaires/billionaires) take responsibility for over hiring which is resulting in these mass layoffs ... that's capitalism I guess ... but let's not glorify them just cause they use the right words when firing hundreds/thousands ... with little to no impact on their own lives .... just saying #tech #jobs #layoffs #capitalism #behuman #venture #startups #bubble #innovation

Se de um lado a saga dos #layoffs continua com grande intensidade em empresas de tecnologia:1. Stripe cortou 14% da força de trabalho (~1.120 pessoas)2. Opendoor desligou 18% do quadro de colaboradores (~550 pessoas)3. Truepill vai para 4ª rodada de layoffs, cortando 1/3 da empresa (~175 pessoas)Por outro lado, nunca tivemos um #DryPowder (recursos destinados a investimentos) tão grande, com um montante em torno de US$ 300 bilhões, segundo dados da consultoria PitchBook Data. Gestoras como Sequoia Capital e Lighspeed, levantaram somadas, a quantia de US$ 9,3 bilhões apenas esse ano. Ao todo, apenas no ano de 2022, o acumulado de captação de fundos de VC foi de US$ 151 bilhões, valor que já supera o somatório de 2021 inteiro. Mesmo em momentos de correção de valuations, e layoffs massivos, ainda existem inúmeras oportunidades a serem exploradas, boas startups em fase de captação, e investidores dispostos a alavancar o potencial de grandes empreendedores.#venturecapital #startups #layoffs

#IPOStartup culture is gaining a very great pace in India.Shark Tank India is also back with its 2nd season, which I think will be a blockbuster, but we'll surely miss one liners & reality checks of Ashneer Grover.Many Startups are now going for IPOs, but ever wondered which are some of the greatly failed IPOs, below are some of them.Starting with G.O.A.T.#1. Reliance Power Ltd.Listed in the year 2008, Reliance Power was also known as the dream IPO of Anil Ambani; this IPO ran very well on the hype wave and took the global market by storm. It was a hit even before reaching the market, and the speculations valued it at almost 190 billion dollars in the local market and also 100 billion dollars from foreign investors. It was one of the biggest IPOs to ever hit the market. But after all this, the IPO listing story was different. Only after a few days of listing did the price of Reliance Shares come crashing down, as if just the name of the company was not enough, nor the tag of Ambani. Very soon the dream run of Ambani's Reliance Power came to a standstill and fast forward to today, the stock price of Reliance Power is down 97% from the listing price. There is nothing more to say after this, there will never be a bigger failure in the history of the stock market.Offer Price: 450Open Price on listing: 547.80Price today: 16.80#2. PAYTM2021 was such a dream run for all the stocks as the markets were breaking records and touching sky-high levels several times. Also known as the golden year for IPOs, Paytm is also a fintech company that launched its IPO in 2021.Many things were blamed upon, for its failure. The extreme Optimism for valuation of over the top of INR 18300 Cr., some said that it's share was way too overpriced, poor performance was also blamed as the reason.Offer Price: 2150Open Price on Listing: 1955Price today: 650.20#3. Coffee day enterprises Ltd.In November 2015, Coffee Day Enterprises came out with a Rs 1,150 crore issue, which was subscribed 1.81 times. The shares dropped over 17 percent on listing day.Offer Price: 328Close Price On Listing: 270.15Price today: 48.90Now, look at the Offer Prices, & Last Trading Prices, like who would have imagined 3 very high profile and huge IPOs would be shattered like this.What do you think is the reason behind falling of these shares?Which are some other most flopped ones that are must to included in the list? Must let us know in the comments.Now BYJU'S  is also planning an IPO of Indian Subsidiary Aakash.After a whole lot of criticism about laying off employees, delay in publishing financials, & recently by onboarding The OG of football, #Messi on it's marketting campaign, what do you think about it's IPO's performance?P.s. And then there is Mike Merill, who divided himself into 100000 shares & set an IPO for $1 a share, and sold 16000 shares uptill now & is trading at $6.LinkedIn #stockmarket #startup #flopIPOs #Byjus #edtechstartup #layoffs

Topic – 3 - Layoff vs RetrenchmentI go through so many posts on LinkedIn where people are talking about layoffs because of Twitter, Udaan, Lift, Stripe etc.People are using layoff and retrenchment interchangeably but there is an enormous difference. Let’s Start with definitions in layman’s language.Layoff –   A layoff is temporary in nature as it indicates the incapability of an employer to continue the employment of the workers for a short period. layoff is volatile in nature, i.e. employees are recalled, once the period of layoff is over.Retrenchment – Retrenchment refers to a situation where the employer removes his employees to increase profits and decrease losses. Retrenchment is non-volatile i.e. it involves full and final termination of services.Legal definition –  Layoff – Section 2 (kkk) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 defines layoff means the failure, refusal or inability of an employer on account of shortage of coal, power or raw materials or the accumulation of stocks or the breakdown of machinery 6[or natural calamity or for any other connected reason] to give employment to a workman whose name is borne on the muster rolls of his industrial establishment and who has not been retrenched.Retrenchment – Section 2 (oo) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 defines retrenchment means the termination by the employer of the service of a workman for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action. I hope this adds to your knowledge.

Love your job, not your Company, BOSS, or CEO!!!!!  Elon musk recently fired the marketing, communication, and engineering team members from Twitter.  Most of them spend their entire careers developing twitter, But now they aren't thinking about this, They simply fired employees.  The Twitter founder got valuable money, But the employees are suffering now. Moral: 	     Everything is changeable at any time, We will have guts to face those situations when we developed our skills day by day.

All the tweets and posts I’ve seen from the #oneteam about their layoffs have been so gracious and diplomatic which’s so impressive considering the crude way they were let go .I don’t even think I’ve such grace (😂) yet because this is possibly the worst way to be fired .I hope Twitter employees file a class action lawsuit against their former employer because I know for sure there’s been a breach in the way they were let go i e without giving 60 days' notice as required by law in violation of federal and Californian law.#twitter #laborlaw #layoffs

Big things happening in Twitter.1️⃣ Twitter revenue is going down by $4 mn everyday which is the reason of mass layoff. Doing the layoff will save $400 million in a year.2️⃣ Big companies have paused to post ads on Twitter platform (Pfizer,GM,Audi,GeneralMills,Volkswagen).3️⃣ Left censorship pressuring advertisers to pause ads on Twitter4️⃣ Dogecoin is Upto ~100% in a month.5️⃣ Tesla is soon going to accept the Dogecoin officially.#elonmusk stated that first 3 reasons may destroy free speech in America even though there is no change in content moderation and also appeased the activist. All these 3 reason got #elonmusk messed up and left with no options, do the layoffs!I understand that all 3 reason may be interlinked but why the good employees be reprimanded in terms of layoffs.Can the world’s richest person think of any good alternative?#elonmusk is a crazy man but not a visionary.What’s your thought?🤔#twitter #layoffs #twittertakeover #dogecoin #tesla

Employees and employers are connected to each other not only financially but also emotionally. The way companies are doing layoffs it will be difficult for employers to build trust among their employees.

With all the recent economic changes, restructuring and downsizing around the world and especially with the big tech players like Meta Twitter Google We will surely see in the near future, 6-12 months much higher costs per acquisition and brands will be on the end facing of these moves. Higher costs for ads coupled with that, higher costs per purchase and leading into diluting profits at the bottom line.These are some of my predictions,Interesting to hear some thoughts on this and how brands can adapt to fight this battle in the future?#layoffs #downsizing #restructuring #tech #google #meta #twitter

Hello friends!Now that I am laid off, in the middle of the swim, I have been thinking about what to do with all this time.So I decided to start fulfilling my long overdue dream - and started writing about my own life. Stories of hope and inspiration - it's my dairy - a life full of failures and success. And I hope this guides you in your own journey - on how you can turn every adversity to your advantage - through your actions.This is my dream - another dream - among the million dreams - that I see every day and night - in this paradise! Have a beautiful day in paradise! 😘🥰💕💜#success #inspiration #writing #contentcreator #bookblogger #life #letsgo #dreamteam #dreamers #dreambig #layoffs #life #layofflife #newideas #creative

As most people have already likely seen, this week was tough for a lot of folks in the tech sector. #Twitter, #Opendoor, #Stripe, #Lyft and others announced reductions in their workforce. To those impacted, I wish you the best in finding your next adventure. Axon is still looking to fill many roles as we head into 2023, such as a Director for our JEDI initiatives (Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion). This is a great opportunity to lead our Affinity Groups and continue to make Axon an #inclusive workplace for everyone. Check out our other roles we’re hiring for at Axon.com/careers and send me a DM if you find anything that interests you. We currently have over 200+ open positions and a remote first working environment with an audacious #moonshot #goal to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% in the next 10 years. #jobopportunities #werehiring #layoffs #remotework #dei #publicsafety #joinforces #thisisaxon

PROMOTE/RETAIN/EXITWhere do you stand in your company and current position?To all those impacted by layoffs this year and those specifically a part of Twitter-50%, Virgin-50%, Snap Inc. (Snapchat)-20%, and Cameo-25% I’m sorry.  I hope that you had a plan and that you are in the process of landing on your feet through this transition.Moments like these can be gut-wrenching and daunting. Depression, frustration, and anger can set in and delay your ability to bounce back from significant emotional events.We should all take notes of this chapter in their lives and understand that business is business, nothing is guaranteed, and nothing lasts forever. Always be prepared, always network, and always have situational awareness of your position, your value, your company, and your yearly placement.

I recently made a personal and vulnerable post to help my household, and unfortunately, I must do so again - as of this morning I was impacted by a company layoff. I'm appreciative of the amazing people I got to work with and the support that was given to me to really craft my role within the studio.I really want to stay in this industry that I'm so passionate about;  remote, full-time gaming roles in player and community support are what I'm looking for at this time. Making the gaming industry and its communities safe, diverse, and accessible is extremely important to me, so I'd love to join a studio that shares these values as well! Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, kind words, or opportunities you can offer. #OpenToWork #gamingjobs #layoffs

Resilient & Recession-Proof: Launching SkillVault ProjectHi LinkedIn Community, Looking at the LinkedIn home feed with post after post notifying of layoffs and rescinded offers is depressing. It is amazing to see how many people respond and offer help to the affected professionals - but I can only imagine the number of less-advanced and less connected professionals, interns and students who will not even have the chance to land the role of their young dreams right now. However, resilience in a crisis (recession) means accepting the unchangeable and taking ownership of what can be done - and after thinking about it for several weeks, I am putting a little courage together and am launching the very scrappy 3-day MVP of SkillVault, a not-for-profit project and free platform to match people who want to grow their skills despite the economic climate with relevant (voluntary) charity-projects (i.e. grow your post-recession career while doing good) and easily provide them with a transparent, valuable digital portfolio and references thereafterhttps://lnkd.in/gKJxScZa- If you know a charity (especially in the SF Bay Area): please set us in touch so that we can create and launch volunteer growth projects together- If you are or know someone looking to grow their skills: please reach out here on LinkedIn or through the website so that we can get started :)- Everyone: please like or share - a little nudge can go a long way  In order to advance from the very scrappy 3-day landing page to an impactful project (and perhaps one day a profitable job platform of the future), I am also looking for SkillVault team members, especially a technical counterpart, data entry, "business" development, marketing, .... Best wishes, Clarissa #recessionproof #layoffs #charity #professionalgrowth #launch #career

So how many of You agree that "Dr. Evil" Elon Musk is totally a Grinch for laying off a gazillion employees right before the Holidays?(Yes, I know that "the business of Business is business" and that such cuts may seem cold since what is more "important" from a business standpoint is the "bottom line" - I learned that in the Ethics course I took for my Master's in Business Communication - but I still think it is an absolutely rotten thing to do and the timing is terrible - not that Mr. Elon Grinch cares at all (again, see my comment above about the bottom line.))#twitter #elonmusk #elon #musk #evil #layoffs #layoff #business #communication

Hey you! This is just a reminder that many successful people you know have:• Been lost with no direction.• Failed at some point (usually multiple times).• Been rejected over and over.• Dealt with anxiety.• Second guessed themselves.• Wondered if they were good enough.• Thought about giving up.• Started from the bottom.• Followed their own path instead of what society said they were “supposed” to do.Everybody has had these feelings.You, me, the dude one office over, Sarah Blakely, Bill Gates.Don't let “Comparison Syndrome” lie to you and tell you otherwise.Don't let the facade of social media warp your image of yourself.Uncertainty is part of being human.Embrace it, sit with it, learn from it.Most importantly, move forward in spite of it. You are not alone.#jobsearching #careertransition #careergrowthgoals #risetogether #layoffs

"Sorry you are laid off today" My CEO gave the horrible news to me in a skype call.For many years I always had this fear of losing my job. My worst fears were coming true. I sat closed up in my room for over a week. I was sulking. It was as if my identity was lost because I had worked for many years. I was shocked because I never thought it would happen to me, but sadly it did. I lost interest in everything & I felt like a loser. It started to impact my mental health. I began to question everything. I had a lot of family responsibilities too.I needed a job badly.I slowly started to search for jobs and within a few weeks I got my first interview call. Strangely I cleared my first interview & luckily within a month I had another job offer. But somehow I did not feel like working again. I was clear I did not want to go through another layoff again in my life. I spoke to my future employer & converted the job offer into a consulting assignment. I also started to consult with other firms as well. I became a consultant & started to enjoy it.I then got offered to be a cofounder with a startup, I picked it up. I started to learn entrepreneurship. That startup did not work but I kept going.Within a few months I started a startup with my friends. It did not do too well. I was failing miserably but strangely I was enjoying it. I started another startup on my own but things did not work well in the first year. I then started to pursue my passion of writing which gave me great joy. I went viral. I became a Storyteller.Our startup BlewMinds - Believe. Be. Beyond  had only 2 followers (me & my cofounder) when we started today we are nearing 50,000 followers.What a crazy journey it has been, if I was not laid off I would be doing another job somewhere & feeling unhappy doing it. The best thing that happened in my life was when I was laid off. I felt horrible then now when I look back if gives me so much happiness.

In lieu of the #layoffs … #socialsaturdaysquad EMT Groupe, LLC is choosing 5 random candidates who WERE NOT apart of this weeks layoffs to help with a #FREE resume and LinkedIn review.I was laid off in June after only 3 weeks in what I deemed to be my “dream salary and bonus” as well but never once did I make a post and beg for sympathy or a job.So, this post is STRICTLY for those who have been looking for their next opportunity, silently, for more than a week.Tag yourself or someone who needs assistance ⬇️ below.
-----------------------------
A long and tough week for the tech industry. Lay offs are never fun, especially with the sheer volume we've seen in recents months and especially this week. This week saw layoffs at: 50% of Twitter13% of Lyft33% of Gem14% of Stripe18% of Opendoor12% of Chime5% of Hootsuite (2nd round)My thoughts are certainly with all those that have been impacted by #layoffs going into the weekend. It has however, been heartwarming to see the amount of care, consideration and empathy shown by so many individuals going out of their way to reach out and help current/ex-colleagues in need. If you're a company, a hiring manager or somebody who has access to job openings please go out of your way to share these on LinkedIn. If you know somebody in your network who has been impacted by layoffs, tag them in relevant job posts or connect them with current #hiring managers in your network. It's a tough time in the job market, so don't underestimate the value of taking the above steps right now. It may lead to somebody getting a job this year.

-----------------------------
As #layoffs continue..I just wanted to say.. to all my friends and connections that got laid off recently or are feeling like workforce cuts are looming..Getting an email or a staff memo notifying you that your role was eliminated without getting to talk to your manager or HR is not OK. EMPLOYEES: At the very least you should be meeting with your manager via video or audio to be notified of a layoff and what next steps you can expect before being shut out of email, slack and all internal systems.Let's not normalize a layoff as an email. In any layoff, people should get the respect and dignity they deserve.#layoffs #RIF #workforce #empathyatwork

IMPORTANT NOTE: I DON'T TRUST MOTIVATIONAL POSTS. What I will mention is science, not motivation.When in stress, oxytocin hormones are elevated. Oxytocin or Love Hormone or Love Drug or Cuddling Hormone, promotes bonding in both romantic and platonic relationships and it is linked to social ties. NOTE: This is science. For me I never take a scientific fact without checking its validity. It is the nature of your body that is pushing you to form ties. To discuss it with others. Never force yourself to keep what you are passing through. Non of us haven't passed through the darkest of times. We have many problems in our daily lives. Just share it, it may help solve the problem and if it wasn't solved you'll get more relaxed. It is not weakness at all, it means you are facing challenges and this is power.And by the way stress helps you think better. You don't trust me, I can give you the Scientific Papers, based on Experimental Studies not Observational Studies. Another note, Experimental Studies give more accurate results.I will stop myself here. If I start talking science, I won't come to an end.In a nutshell, all the stress you are overwhelmed with, YOUR BODY is SCIENTIFICALLY pushing you to share it with others.#love #science #stress #stressmanagement #layoffs #conflict #help #power #crisis

It’s really disappointing to see a certain group of people on here turning the Twitter layoffs political and celebrating people losing their jobs.I sincerely hope none of you ever have to experience what it’s like to lose your safety net. To have to start over again in a time where so many companies are freezing hiring, especially as we head into the holiday season.(This is the nice version. Stay tuned to hear how I really feel.)#twitter #layoffs

Even if you think you don’t need help with your resume, I highly suggest taking advantage of this. To all of my #laidoff #Lessen friends and those affected by the myriad #layoffs by #opendoor, #better, #stripe, and many other companies whose bad news has been plaguing my feed: you should definitely hop on board. Cole helped me redesign my resume when I was switching to management from a sales background. As soon as I updated my resume with his tips and suggestions, I stopped getting targeted by sales recruiters and had multiple prospective employers reach out to me to schedule interviews for PM positions. Thanks to him, I landed a job with Lessen and was able to have a career I honestly loved for the past 10 months leading up to the layoffs. I met a bunch of people and made relationships that have helped me continue to work in residential project management even after I lost my position. Don’t ever assume you’ve got it all figured out. Your resume may be working for you… but maybe it could be better? #help #resume #opentowork #job #work #career #people #resumeworkshop

It’s heartbreaking 💔 that when I returned from a break and saw my team at Lyft was cut by half. As an IC, I really don’t know how the decision was made on who to let go.

So here’s what laid off workers Don’t want to hear:🤯 Oh it’s their loss not yours.  💥 Nope. I’m the one without the job.🤯 When one door closes another opens.💥 Right now the door is slammed.🤯You’ll find the right job at the right time💥 Time doesn’t pay bills.🤯 You’re better than that. 💥 🤔 🤯 Take some time to relax and enjoy the time off 💥 😂 That was one of my faves. Really? Listen, some people are happy to hear these messages. But for me, and many I’ve spoken to, the attempt to be positive at first, falls flat. People are well-meaning. We want to say the right things.So try: I’m sorry.How can I help? What do you need? And listening. In time, those who have been laid off WILL be fine. Many, like me, will be better off as a result. But no one sees that in the moment. And quite frankly very few want to hear it right away. It’s ok to embrace the suck. Be mad. Angry. Sad. All laid off will pick themselves up and get back to it. But until then? Just listen and try to help and leave the platitudes out of it. This is what I want a social Saturday to be. To those who have been laid off, how can I help? Be a good human. Support workers.#lovewhereyouwork #lovewhereyouworked #layoffs #opentowork #socialsaturday

You are not your layoff.This picture was taken shortly after I was laid off in 2017.  It is one of my favorite pictures.This picture was taken toward the end of a safari we planned and booked through Costco within a 3 week period.It perfectly captures the moment, the smile, when I was able to begin to let go of the defeat, humiliation, and insecurity caused by a layoff.  It took completely unpluggingAnd traveling to another continentAnd seeing a lionAnd a zebraFor everyone impacted by these recent layoffs, you will have this same moment.  And it will be the start of something incredible.The world outside your cubicle (or home office) is huge and amazing and waiting for your invaluable contribution to make it a better place.#layoffs

For anyone going through a layoff, I'm just gonna leave this here....The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) protects workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers with 100 or more employees (generally not counting those who have worked less than six months in the last 12 months and those who work an average of less than 20 hours a week) to provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing and mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment. #warnact #employment #layoffs #work #knowyourrights

Welp. Looks like the growing #layoffs party is a rager. 🍻 Salespeople - I'm sorry our senior leadership overcommitted to the board, over hired, and had to make some "really tough decisions." (Poor babies 🥺) It sucks. It's not fair. They said we were pretty!Ok so right about now, everyone and their cousin wants you to "let them know how they can help." (You should sometimes, btw.) I believe I have a more direct approach.Now that I have some unexpected free time on my hands the sales leader in me still wants to serve salespeople like I always have since they deserve better. Here we go: I've conducted over 500 sales interviews in my career. I have used that experience to help dozens of my close friends and colleagues prep for and land their next gig by conducting mock interviews with them. I'm extending that to you fellow job seekers* for free. Absolutely free. No strings attached. I'll never ask you for anything in return. ⭐ I'm reserving 5-10 time slots per week through EOY where I will mock interview you for 30 minutes, with 15 minutes of feedback. First come, first served. ⭐ How was your posture? Did you ask great questions? How was your storytelling? Did you understand the question behind the question? If this could be of value to you, drop a comment or message me directly and we'll get it scheduled.If you know someone this could help, make sure they see this. *Sorry friends who are currently employed, you'll have to wait your turn. #sales #interviewing #hollaatchaboi

I am an admirer of capitalism and the wonders it has brought to the world. But when the richest person on the planet wipes off half the people in a company like dust on his jacket, in the most dramatic and undignified manner conceivable - you know that capitalism, as any other system past its expiry date, is taking a dangerous turn.I know that at times letting people go is a business necessity.Yet, there are things that extend beyond business to the realm of humanity.Treating people with basic dignity and respect is one of them.Even if for optics, it matters.Musk is inspiring many others in the eccentric multi-billion dollar club to do similar things with their employees - just to look cool.Blind worshippers of capitalism may not see anything wrong with this.But guess what: many didn't see anything wrong with slavery till very recently.Logic and business case do not always drive humanity.#twitter #elonmusk #layoffs

Last night I got laid off from Twitter I am sad that my journey had to end this way, but I have no regrets while being here. Twitter was an amazing company to work for - I met talented engineers, great people and #lovewhereiworked 💙 because of them.  Working on the complex ad-serving architecture and dealing with the technical challenges that come with helped me grow as engineer. I've learned so much about how to build a project from the ground up at this scale and engage in cross-collaboration between various workstreams.Now, I am looking for new software engineering roles. I am excited to contribute / apply my skills in a new way 😀#twitter #layoffs #oneteam

Stripe made the very hard decision this week to reduce the size of our team by 14%. We have had to say goodbye to many talented people across all functions, many of whom I had the great pleasure of working with directly.

If you are #hiring you can help by sending an email to alumni-hiring@stripe.com with your company name and the list of your open roles. I’ll also be reposting and commenting to bring you all visibility to Stripe alumni looking for work. And for Stripe alumni impacted by the #layoffs, please reach out if I can help you make a connection. 💙

It feels like every day when I open my LinkedIn there is post after post after post about layoffs, especially for my fellow #recruiters. Layoffs are scary, painful, and can be damaging to one's confidence. It's especially disheartening when just this time last year the market was HOT and a candidate's paradise... that's sadly not the state of the job market we find ourselves in today. If you are an #R4R recruiter PLEASE advertise your hiring needs so others can like / share to increase circulation! And if you're a #recruiter who's found themselves back on the job market:1) Don't lose hope! You *will* find a new home for yourself; 2) My connections are your connections. Please feel free to look through my network and I'll be happy to make any introductions on your behalf (whether we know each other or not). Let's use LinkedIn to support one another through these trying times!#hiring #hiringrecruiters #connections #layoffs

I remember that day in June when hundreds of us got laid off on a Teams call. Within an hour our access was cut off.It was inhumane. It was painful.For hundreds of us who gave a lot, on nights and weekends. It was personal. We were 𝐇𝐔𝐌𝐀𝐍𝐒 … Humans who had medical conditions. Humans who had disabilities.Humans who were the only breadwinners for our families. Humans on visas who had to return to a “home” country they no longer called home.... and the company did not see us that way, they saw us as numbers on a spreadsheet. 💔 Layoffs are made for business decisions. And I get it.BUT …It's not hard to treat someone like a human and with dignity. #kindnessmatters  Many people have been impacted in recent weeks and are surfing the range of emotions. Many people just like me were laid off in a way that no human should be treated.And while we can all say to the employers “do not do it”, I want to offer concrete help to those that were affected, because I have been where you are now. It hurts. It is hard.Finding yourself without a job is a very scary time for many.So, here’s how I can help:➡  If you see someone in my network who is hiring, I am happy to introduce you to them.➡  If you need a resume or #Linkedin profile review, DM me➡ If you need a pep talk, DM me.And I encourage people in my network to do the same.After all, we are all HUMAN. ❤ And we can help each other.#layoffs #leadership #empathy #hiring

My LinkedIn feed today, just like everyone else’s, is filled with layoff announcements from companies in all different industries. This is a stressful time for many people losing jobs, careers and for those wondering if they might be next. Make sure to reach out to your friends, colleagues and the rest of your network today and check-in. We are all human and a simple note goes a long way. And for those effected, let’s do what we can to ensure they land on their feet.#layoffs #jobs #careers

The continuous layoff posts on LinkedIn are upsetting. I have been there and I know it can be not easy, but I have experienced and I agree with the idea that when a door closes there is always a bigger one opening🚪  If anyone in my network was affected by recent redundancies drop me your CV if you'd like, I am recruiting for several roles in HR, Sales and Admin, in Ireland 📢Happy weekend all🏡 #layoffs #opportunities #support #hiring #recruitment #hr #sales #admin

Not the best way to end the year with MORE #layoffs. To everyone looking for a new opportunity (affected by layoffs since 2020, 2021, and 2022. Looking to return to the workforce due to personal matters or transition to a new opportunity.), sending best wishes.My mother always said, "make sure you don't jump out of one fire into another." In this case, let's ensure you don't leave one horrid workplace for another. UPDATES ON LAYOFFS:NY Post - https://lnkd.in/ebXwJ-pALayoffs.fyi Tracker - https://layoffs.fyi/ Candor - https://lnkd.in/ei2AFWRx (If you have more trackers/resources, drop a link). TIPS:- TikTok is an excellent search engine lookup "layoffs...", if you want real-time updates from real people. Of course, other social media.- LinkedIn search "layoff and the company name" as you're interviewing. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:- "Is this a new position or back-fill?"- "What's the business need for this role?" - "Has the company had any recent downsizing / was this department affected by the downsizing?" #shadenespeaks #linkedincommunity #hrcommunity #jobsearchtips #jobchangers #jobseekers #jobseekingtips #jobseeking

Tough times don’t last, tough people do.My heart goes out to people impacted by layoffs.The most notable layoffs this week were Twitter (3600+ people laid off) and Stripe (1000+ people laid off).Losing a job is one of the most stressful life events. It’s hard, emotional, and traumatizing.On the other hand, it can also be a relieve and blessing in disguise. You may not realize that until later on. I lost my job in 2011 - two months before my wedding. I was emotional yet glad it gave me the space to plan my wedding. Losing my job was the best thing that happened as it gave me the fire to kick start my coaching business within a week.Some quick advice on dealing with a layoff / job loss:  💎 Seek legal advice of what you’re entitled to - fight for your rights!💎 Take some time off to process your emotions, sleep in and unwind 💎 Reflect on what you really want next and what your non- negotiables are💎 Map out your proud career highlights 💎 Remind yourself of your amazing qualities and strengths 💎 Cut out unnecessary expenses 💎 Talk to friends and colleagues 💎 Take advantage of free career transition & job search resources available, hire career experts if you can  💎 Update your LinkedIn, resume and elevator pitch 💎 Be active on LinkedIn to increase your visibility and ask for help 💎 Consider starting a side hustle for extra income - monetize your expertise 💎 Upgrade your knowledge and skills with LinkedIn Learning courses🌟 Remember: You are more than your job title. You are worthy and valuable.📍DON’T RUSH into a new job without doing your due diligence and knowing what you truly want and what makes you happy.As a Career Coach for over a decade, I’ve seen too many people this past year start a job and decide to leave within a few months as it’s not the right fit. (Aka job not as advertised)I’ve also seen people quit a job due to burnout without anything lined up. Haven’t seen this in 10 years.We’re living in unprecedented times. Take care of yourself and mental health.I’ll be offering a free training on Nov 17 on “How to Navigate Your Career Post Layoff”. Follow me and hit the bell 🔔 button to stay tuned!In the meantime, here’s a free webinar that I did with Sweta Regmi, CCS, CRS on “How to Bounce Back from a Layoff & Own a Career Gap”:https://lnkd.in/gssWcWjVSending out good vibes! 💖#layoffs #bestadvice #twitterlayoffs #jobchange #mentalhealth

Want to get more #interviews? Let your #resume stand out. 🎨🦄Due to all the new people entering the job market due to #layoffs, #bootcampgrads, #earlycareer and many other #careerchangers there is simply a lot more people competing for jobs. I am sharing my own resume that gets me interviews all the time in case this helps bring some #creativity to the #jobsearch process. Networking also helps, the resume is useful too!  A few thoughts on #resume  - Most of them are SOO boring. That's not to say they are not informative and useful, but they are also hard to scan and it's difficult to tell what's relevant, which makes the life of #recruiters more difficult. One of your jobs as a jobseeker is to make it easier for recruiters to see you, not harder.Will this work for everyone? NO, This kind of resume might not work for everyone if it's not your style, or the regular format gets you interviews just fine. For those who are #careerchangers, #bootcamp grads, this can be a powerful way to show off your personal achievements in an easy to read and user friendly way. Why am I sharing my resume? Because there are TOO many examples of homogenous advice and too few examples of trying something different. See below for one of them 👇

#Twitter India's entire Marketing department has been fired.#byjus recently fired 12000 employeesEmployees in twitter are receiving emails today on their gmail that they have been fired effective immediately, and they are being locked out of their systems.Around 50% of all twitter employees are getting fired.People who have dedicated their entire lives to building Twitter are shocked! They don't know what to do now with their life now as Twitter was their life.There are tears everywhere. Employees are hanging out in #Slack, saying nice things to each other until their access is cut off.I've never seen anything like it.Moral for us?Career is not everything. Life is unpredictable.

Well, folks. I've been chopped by the new management at Twitter, along with 50% of the company. I'm grateful for the experiences and the people I met during my time as a tweep. Truly the most talented, compassionate group of people I've ever worked with, and I will probably spend the rest of my career trying to find or replicate that magic. For those still there, hang in there. You've got this. 💙Now that I'm finally off that ride, I'm looking forward to whatever's next. Going to take some time to travel, spend quality time with loved ones and my community, THEN map out my next moves.✌🏼 signing off!#gratitude #marketing #tech #layoffs #opentowork

As a former #opendooremployee and #tweep, my heart goes out to all of the extended family I’ve been privileged to work with over the years along w/ those who’ve either come from or moved on to the other companies (Chime, Lyft, Stripe, Affirm, and Gem) experiencing mass #layoffs this week. Wanted to offer up help or assistance in any way I can. These teams are FLOODED with incredible talent.For those that are looking, Kalshi is #stillhiring for Backend Engineers, Quant Developers, Quant Researchers, and an Infrastructure Engineer.For my #recruiter familia, the following companies are still hiring:- Traba- Phantom- Whatnot - The Browser Company- Infinitus Systems, Inc.- Electric HydrogenFor everyone else, the following companies are still hiring:- Zip- Pave- Ironclad- Watershed- Avalanche- Assembled- Mysten Labs- Discord - Arize AI - Anduril Industries- Chainlink Labs- Toast- Cedar- HubSpot- Earnin - Grammarly- Chainalysis Inc. - Level - Thrive Market If you’re not finding your ideal role, go on #crunchbase and look up companies that just received funding from Sequoia Capital, Y Combinator, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, Human Capital, Kleiner Perkins etc. Many times, jobs won’t be immediately published. Reach out directly to the hiring manager on Linkedin by sending them a short note so you can stand out.If there are any companies i might’ve missed, please drop them here.Hope this helps.

With all the layoffs currently happening, this is a good time for some reminders to the ones who are still employed (for now).1) Don’t use your work email for anything you want access to after your employment ends. Your job could end suddenly, and that email is gone.2) If at all possible, don’t use your work computer for anything personal. Use your phone or tablet. 3) Use your cellular Internet connection with phone or tablet for personal communications/activities, rather than the company’s Internet.4) Keep your personal documents on a USB drive, not the company’s computer.5) If you work from a home office, set up a separate network for work. Keep their laptop isolated from your home network.#callmeifyouneedme #fifonetworks#layoffs #career #jobs #privacy #employment

I am not a career expert. However wanted to contribute something useful seeing posts about many people losing their livelihoods today. Here are 10 things I would do if I were in transition today. Hope this is of some use to you. 1. Know that its not personal.    Markets change, and companies make financial decisions. It may be more difficult to do this when you are treated in a very cold manner by insensitive leadership. Unfortunately there are several people unworthy of leadership positions making some of these decisions as we speak. I have been on the other side of this, so I know how this feels. This is the last thing you want for your confidence. Please do not let them sow doubts in your abilities. 2. Assess your financial situation.    If you have enough put away to afford a week or two of a break to do things you enjoy, pls take it. This gives clarity in how you approach your next move. 3. Give confidence to your dependents.   Assure them you’ve got this, you are perfectly fine, and that you will find a better life-work fit for you and them. 4. Think of what your goals are for the next move   Lay it down. Set clear objective functions that will help you negotiate exactly what you are looking for in the next job.5. Review and update your resume.   Ensure that the resume speaks to what you want to do next. Be bold with delivery methods that clearly portray your skills and what you bring to the table. Dont be afraid to show some personality6. Reach out to your trusted network, & even leaders you do not know for advice    You never know which doors open what possibilities. The great Steve Jobs found his first job by cold calling the leader of the company he wanted to work for. There are many good people who are willing to help if they can.7. Identify the organizations you want to work for- that seem to align to your values   At the end of the day, this can determine how happy you are at the next gig. Trying to find something in desperation will do more long term harm than good. 8. Do your research   Research the company and the teams thoroughly9. Try sending personal notes infused with levity   Not to sound desperate, but to show you will bring it everyday. This could be the difference in you standing out among everyone that applied. 10. Be yourself in the interviews   What got you so far can take you even further. Know your worth, and don’t compromise on your values. The job market is still very strong. I just heard yesterday from a credible source that US currently has 10MM open jobs. The right job might just be around the corner. Wishing you the best.hope you land your dream job soon… PS: If you are considering MGM, and have a role that fits, pls feel free to reach out with your resume. #layoffs #career #job #work

RIFs suck no matter the reason and whether you're the one making the decision or you're the one being laid off.  Planning proper communications is a key to limiting the pain.  Plan communications for the management team (to understand the decisions made, the reasons behind them, and how to communicate with their teams), the employees being let go, the employees remaining, and, if a larger and/or public company, the public.  Twitter is learning this lesson the hard way.  Stripe seems to be taking the right approach. (Also, remember to do your disparate impact study, provide appropriate federal and state WARN notices, and comply with final paycheck rules per location.)  #TheRetailLawyer #employers #RIFs #WARN #layoffs #employees #attorneyadvertisement #WBE #wbencnetworkhttps://lnkd.in/ekz7ytx7

To the people who recently lost their job. I see you. I feel you.My husband was laid off during the pandemic. With a concentrated effort, he landed a new role in just 2 months. He convinced an organization in another province to hire him remotely (when the role was not originally a remote position). How did he do it?  He:  ✔️ Knew his target and built a great resume (yes, of course, I helped, but I also taught him how to own the customization process)  ✔️ Created a job search plan with a daily schedule – and executed it  ✔️ Conducted lots of research and searched out decision-makers  ✔️ Identified a well-suited opportunity that was not in our city, so he researched the organization, found a person in his network who worked there, and reached out  ✔️ Ensured that his resume was given directly to the hiring manager (care of the internal contact)  ✔️ Prepared diligently for multiple interviews, including a well-thought-out pitch on how he could manage the role remotely  ✔️ Secured the offer Job searching is tough, but you don't have to do it alone. Stay focused! Stay positive! Make a plan and execute it with care.I share more strategies and resources in the article below. Check it out and pass it along to those in need.  #jobsearch #hiringandpromotion #laidoff #layoffs #gethired

What a ride. After 9 years, this is not how I thought it would end, but today is my last day at Twitter. It has been one of the best experiences of my life and I’ve met so many amazing people during that time who will be friends for life. For that I will always be grateful.It’s hard to explain, but #Twitter was truly a special place and the #oneteam culture we created will be hard to replicate. There are too many to name, but thank you to everyone who made it so great along the way.That said, if you or anyone you know is looking for a Sr. Recruiter with a passion for ML and helping build great teams, please let me know. #layoffs #lovewhereyouwork #recruiting #tweeps #opentowork

There's been a lot of news of #layoffs  continuing in the #tech  sector and my network has been filled with talented folks and former colleagues affected. As we approach the holidays a couple things to keep in mind:First, it's important to know that being laid off is NOT your fault. It's nothing to do with your performance or ability. Layoffs are the company's fault.Don't be afraid to reach out in your network and ask for support. That's the entire purpose of #LinkedIn: to connect and help people grow in their careers.#Hiring will start slowing down as the end-of-year/holidays approach, if you're not getting any bites, keep going. Things will pick up in the new year. Connect with recruiters and take this time to research ideal companies and roles. Find out roles that are in high demand and how your skills can tie to them. Now's the time to get really crisp on what you're great at doing, selling that and knowing your worth. To all in my network affected by the recent tech layoffs, let me know if there's anyone in my network you'd like an intro!Keep your head up. This too shall pass.
-----------------------------
My heart goes out to the people experiencing layoffs. I’ve been there. *It sucks*. For the people left without their valued colleagues, and especially for the heartbroken people departing a job, a career, a way of life…and stepping into uncertainty. I want to tell you that it’s going to be okay, but *f-that*. Mourn, grieve, scream, cry and then pick yourself up and start again. It’s a loss, but a new beginning is ahead. Give yourself time. Give yourself grace. Hopefully some day you can look back on it as the best thing that could have ever happened to you. I know I did. Those of us that were former Peregrine Systems employees do. We watched the giant tumble. We made our way to other startups, and enterprises, and some of us built our own from the ground up like Service Now. Wherever you are 1 month, 1 year, 5 years, or even 10 years from now, this will be just a blip in the adventure of life. 💗 #openforjobs #layoffs #hiring

A friend of mine in the USA was let go a couple days ago from one of those “layoff trends.” This is a major enterprise company. They have #TABLEAU/#SQL skills and degree. I trained them 1on1 for 6 months straight at their previous role, they could easily take over any reporting environment…, and this enterprise company has no idea how insanely talented they are at Tableau, working with technical experts, and even executives. I’m vouching for them in this post or on a zoom call. Even though I was paid to train them, they taught me a lot because they had more creative ideas than my ten years of tableau consulting… we made amazing tech and adoption boomed. This is a major win for anyone eager for a smart, passionate, analytics guru with tons of projects under their belt. I taught them all the coolest things I know and a lot about #dataanalytics, project management, and operationalizing. We used #figma and #trello while managing some of the biggest tableau workbooks I’ve ever created. They have 3 years+ of tableau experience And degree; BS in business admin with a concentration in business analytics. They are awesome to work with and eager to get started in a new FTE opportunity. Mostly I want to note: Each day I had a meeting with them I enjoyed my day more and I looked forward to those meetings because I enjoyed working with them that much.Please dm me for contact information. Serious inquiry only, they are applying to ten jobs a day, and will be hired fast. #layoffs #opentowork (If you understand what they are experiencing - Like or share this to help this post increase visibility) #businessanalytics

Why would they post this now?!? It’s too late!Maybe it's WAY too early... Either way, If you’re reading this, I guess it got your attention.Also, "It's too late!" is how employees feel when you let them go without proper offboarding, including OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES. OP lets them know that you appreciate them before it’s too late.Follow the link in the first comment to learn more about #outplacementservices and what Spectrum can do to help individuals face changes and organizations change faces.#spectrumoutplacement #spectrumrecruiting #spectrumtalentaquisition #recruiting #outplacement #consulting #rpo #manufacturing #engineering #layoffs #rifs

So there's a massive layoff happening at Twitter and some of the collateral damage is the employee resource groups. One former Twitter employee (Sioban V. Massiah) posts about this and a comment from a Director of Global Learning Operations at Vertiv (apparently a Columbus, OH based company) displays both his own ignorance and lack of self-awareness in hurtful comments. Vertiv, this is your employee putting his racism on display! Also he doesn't understand what woke means.

What a week! My heart goes out to everyone affected by the layoffs at Stripe, Lyft, PayPal, Gem, Twitter, Nextdoor, Chime, etc. If there’s any role at New Relic, Inc. https://newrelic.careers/ that interests you, please let me know. I am also hiring for a Lead Frontend Engineer (https://lnkd.in/garicuWN). Happy to connect you to anyone in my network too.#stripe #lyft #paypal #twitter #gem #nextdoor #chime #hiring #layoffs #tech

I’m not going to talk about #layoffs because it doesn’t matter how many of you discuss it, they’ve happened and will continue to happen.Let’s focus on how to get you re-employed as fast as possible.Manifestation is real.Energy is real.Talk to the Universe, talk to God about what you WANT and NEED in your next opportunity.Write down your 30/60/90 day goals. Consider a career change to a more stable industry or path.Start re-structuring your resume and updating or completely overhauling your LinkedIn.Brush up on your interview skills.Network, network, network. No, that does not mean you have to buy anyone coffee to get a job.It means stop looking at your requested connections and wondering who they are because you never know where your next opportunity will come from.It also means stop just “liking” posts and actually composing your own posts at least once a week and when you engage on another post, write a substantive reply on the post to attract others. Think outside the box when looking for jobs.If you keep complaining about the layoffs and mourning a job you no longer have, you’re going to get suckered into depression. And because the holidays is the time of year when most individuals experience situational depression already, you don’t need to add any thing that will keep you down.AND STOP THINKING YOU ARE TOO GOOD FOR CERTAIN JOBS.Your focus should be survival and your family, by any means necessary.Likes and comments or going viral for a #layoff post is NOT going to get you a job. It will, however, garner support from others in the same situation.FOCUS!!Good luck.You time is coming….Be well.

Employees are hanging out in #Slack, saying nice things to each other until their access is cut off.I've never seen anything like it.Moral for us?Career is not everything. Life is unpredictable.

RIFs suck no matter the reason and whether you're the one making the decision or you're the one being laid off.  Planning proper communications is a key to limiting the pain.  Plan communications for the management team (to understand the decisions made, the reasons behind them, and how to communicate with their teams), the employees being let go, the employees remaining, and, if a larger and/or public company, the public.  Twitter is learning this lesson the hard way.  Stripe seems to be taking the right approach. (Also, remember to do your disparate impact study, provide appropriate federal and state WARN notices, and comply with final paycheck rules per location.)  #TheRetailLawyer #employers #RIFs #WARN #layoffs #employees #attorneyadvertisement #WBE #wbencnetworkhttps://lnkd.in/ejpqfXbz
