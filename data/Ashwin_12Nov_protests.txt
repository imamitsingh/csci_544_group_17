Personally, I strongly support activists and I even admire their activities (send petitions to the government & Parliament, or peacefully protest outside Westminster). However, I do not support blocking roads to demand changes, as this action does not convince people. Instead, it makes people feel absurd and annoying, especially when someone is in emergency and they want to go to hospital for treatment immediately. In case they could not get treatment on time, their life will be at risk and protesters who blocks roads will have to take responsibility for their actions. #protests Just Stop Oil: What is it and what are its goals?

Let’s not be hoodwinked by Just StopOil’s ill-considered ‘Remembrance’ comment They stopped because they’ve alienated the very people they need to support them, and a grown up in the group has realised thatIt’s a perfect example of not thinking through the consequences of actions - a total lack of risk management or awareness Maybe they’ll think through their approaches in future and make them more targeted?What do people think would be an effective way for them to protest?#juststopoil #riskmanagement #protests Just Stop Oil: M25 protests to be halted

What is the fallout from another morning of protests on the M25? Massive disruption across North West Kent - it's not just the motorway affected. This is the traffic through the usually sleepy Hamlet of Bean; just off the Bluewater junction from the A2. Do 'Just Stop Oil' have a justifiable right to cause this mayhem? Or are their methods alienating people that could help them influence MPs?#juststopoil #protests #traffic #m25 #northwestkent #kent

Kowtowing California-based Apple has been criticized in the past for making changes to iPhone features to appease the Chinese government. In one example, the iPhone maker took heat in 2019 for hiding the Taiwanese flag emoji for users in Hong Kong or Macau. It also removed apps for virtual private networks, or VPNs, which are commonly used to circumvent the country’s internet firewall. Many of Apple’s own services are also inaccessible in China -- the world’s biggest smartphone market -- including Apple TV+, the iTunes Store, paid podcasts, Apple Books and Apple Arcade. #china #iphone #kowtow #protests

#Protests are nothing new in #iran. There were 4,000 protests in the first half of 2022 alone. But when the protests, triggered by the death of #Mahsa_Jhina_Amini, started a few weeks ago, Hamid Talebian and I immediately had the feeling that this time something was different. Iranians, united for the first time in a very long time, weren't asking for #reforms but for a change in the political system. Seing the brutal crackdown of protests by the Iranian #regime, we wondered what the response of the international community could be. How would and could especially states, with a so-called #feministforeignpolicy react? We often had the impression that people are triggered by the word #feminist and tend to believe it's a policy for women only. To those people I would like to say that it's not. It's not about excluding, but including. With our article we wanted to clear up these misconceptions.Now, are the recommendations that we make enough to bring about change in Iran? Absolutely not! But we have to start somewhere and sometimes even the smallest steps can pave the way. Also, a feminist foreign policy is not something you attain by changing a policy here and there. It is a radical transformation and such profound transformations need time to be truely sustainable.I honestly don't know what the future holds for Iran and its people, but I do know that fighting for a foreign policy that is not solely based on national and economic interests but also on the interests of the people it is targeting, is worthwile. Because at the end a feminist foreign policy is an #inclusive and human-centered policy. And isn't this something worth striving for?

When I sent an email to Justine asking if I can take over Parlour Inc: gender, equity, architecture Instagram page to raise awareness about #womanlifefreedom movement in Iran, it took her only 3 minutes to get back to me with a positive response. That is what SUPPORT looks like.During the last 40 days that the protests sparked in Iran, there has been a huge volume of artwork created in response to this movement. I am taking over Parlour Inc: gender, equity, architecture and Architects for Peace Instagram page from Monday 31 October to share the story of bravery of Iranian women and girls in the midst of the biggest feminist movement in the middle east through the lens of arts, architecture, and activism. Each day will be themed around a branch of art and I will introduce an artist or an activist and their work. I will also share photos of defining moments from the last 40 days of protests. Iranians are risking everything to protest in the streets of Iran while the internet has been shut off in parts of Iran and access to platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram is blocked or limited. https://lnkd.in/gDB9QBPtTogether we can be their voice.#womanlifefreedom #architecture #protests #activism

Do you think protests are going too far? I do…The security industry has enough pressures without dealing with inconsiderate protestors. We are all for peaceful protests, but these people are putting lives at risk in an already busy city that needs security directed elsewhere.With over 500 arrests, there is a developing problem. There is a balance to be had between rights to protest and vandalism/anti-social behaviour. How can we encourage peaceful protests, and channel our security to the areas that matter?#londonprotests #security #policing #securityindustry #herongrange #protests

NEW PODCAST: Pakistan's volatile political landscape following the Imran Khan shooting.Join your host, Dr Guo Yu, Sibylline's Lead Asia-Pacific Analyst along with Supriya Ravishankar, our APAC Analyst, to discuss Pakistan's ongoing political instability and the wider economic and security implications. On 3 November, former prime minister and leader of the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Imran Khan was shot and injured during a high-profile anti-government protest rally, dubbed the 'long march'. The incident has further inflamed the already elevated tensions between the PTI and the Pakistan Muslim League (N)-led government, with Khan and the PTI accusing incumbent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army of being responsible for the 'assassination attempt'. As Khan seeks to return to power while the current government continues to resist calls for an early election, Pakistan's domestic political situation looks set to remain highly volatile in the coming weeks.Listen Now: https://lnkd.in/eXEJW9A3#pakistan #imrankhan #politicalunrest #protests #elections

İran has sentenced over 15.000 protesters as an "important lesson". A vote of 227 to 290, a vast majority of the parliament.Many protesters have already been killed. Others kidnapped and tortured, nowhere to be found by their families.Governments around the world need to push for sanctions against those who participate in the repressive Irani regime but have families in freer countries. The people outside of Iran need to be aware and support the women, men, and youth of Iran. Please share, talk, discuss, protest if you can. #jinjiyanazadi #iran #protests

I appeared on Press TV to discuss the protests in Germany.  Some observations:1.  Two years ago, thousands of German farmers protested against new environmental regulations designed to force them out of business.2.  Last year, the German Green Party received 14.8% of the vote (3rd place).  No party received a majority of the vote.  Imagine trying to form a coalition government with the Green Party.3.  Recently, environmental extremists have been blocking roads because they cannot win elections.  What would you do if a loved one died in an ambulence stuck on the road because of environmental extremists?4.  German businesses have been closing because they cannot afford the electricity bills.  When you lose your job, you have more worries than the increased cost of food.5. Europe lacks sufficient energy resources. Why would they try to end fossil fuel, coal, and nuclear power?  Communist China is expanding its number of coal mines.6.  Why did Germans make with the Russians the Nord Stream pipelines and then provoke the Ukraine War? #Presstv #Germany #Protests #Greenparty #Environmentalextremists #Russia #Nordstream #Ukrainewar #China

Protests in Iran have been going on non-stop for seven weeks. Images are harrowing. The death toll reached 300. What brought the country to this situation? Western influence during the Pahlavi dynasty? Interests on oil extraction? Mehdi Alavi, Ph.D., MBA and Atul Singh contextualize the current state of affairs and help us make sense of these events by diving into the history previous to the Islamic Republic of Iran, this, began with the Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty.  "Currently, Iran is ruled by mullahs. Iran’s theocratic regime is disliked by the US and its allies, if not despised.Many, including prominent Iranians, blame the mullahs for all of Iran’s ills.However, few are aware of an inconvenient truth. The #British paved the path to power for the mullahs, with the Americans constructing the mile."#help #events #power #protests #iranprotests #iran #iranianwomen #oil

What is the tipping point in creating massive social change?It is much less than you might think.And a flywheel effect of adoption happens after the tipping point is met with the right conditions.Two critical research findings…1) The 25% Rule for Critical Mass towards Social ChangeMost of us think you must reach 51% of the population to get social change. But recent research shows that when 25% of the population holds a minority view that there is a flywheel effect that can happen and at that point, the minority view can affect the majority opinion.See:https://lnkd.in/eTghXekand interpretation of the same:https://lnkd.in/eFi5YQd2) The 3.5% Rule for the Scale of Nonviolent Civil ResistanceA global study of nonviolent protests by researchers found that protest movements that included just 3.5% (or more) of the population were successful at creating change.https://lnkd.in/eaG8e8HFrom the study: “Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts – and those engaging a threshold of 3.5% of the population have never failed to bring about change.” #socialchange #organizinginspiration #organizing #progressivethinking #nonprofits #nonprofitleadership #climatechange #pluralism #interfaith #interreligious #intercultural #interracial #ngos #ingo #cop27 #cop27egypt #faiths4climate #research #change #civilsociety #protest #protests

GAO bid protest stats get a lot of attention.But what about SBA size/status protests?A recent SBA OIG report includes some intriguing data.Out of 364 size/status protests filed in FY21, more than half (52%) were dismissed.The deadlines are very tight for size/status protests and they might not be an available option depending on the type of procurement at issue. A large dismissal percentage is likely due to untimeliness and other procedural defects.Putting aside the dismissals, there were 174 protests decided on the merits. Of those, more than 37% were sustained. By comparison, the GAO sustain rate last year was 13%.Unlike a GAO protest, there are no Pyrrhic victories in SBA protests.  A sustained SBA protest will disqualify your competitor and there is no “corrective action” to salvage the original award. So next time you are on the losing end of a set-aside remember that a size/status protest may be your best bet to overturning the award. #governmentcontracting #sba #protests #procurement

My complaint to the BBC - if you agree please complain too!"I wish to complain about Julia Hartley- Brewer's uninformed and arrogant denial about the IPCC reports on climate change. She said that climate models have been exposed as a complete nonsense. She told people to read the IPCC reports - she clearly has not - or has read them through a mental lens of denial.  If you are going to bring climate deniers onto BBCQT you should also bring an IPCC lead scientist. In the past you used to insist on having a climate denier on every time you had someone talking about climate change. At one point several academics declined to appear on the BBC to discuss climate change for that reason. They were fed up with being told it was to "balance the debate". There is NO debate left amongst the legitimate scientific community that climate change is not a significant threat to life. There is no debate at the United Nations or its IPCC. There is debate about the speed that events will unfold. But this is different from a denial debate. To allow climate denial on this scale to appear and go relatively unchecked (Fiona Bruce made a couple of feeble attempts) is akin to allowing denial of any other human rights abuses where harm, suffering and death has occurred, wilfully.  You would not allow it. Why do you allow it when it comes to climate change? And whilst David Lammy was supportive of the evidence for climate change, his suggestion that protestors stop ambulances is completely wrong - and was unchallenged by Fiona Bruce- every single protestor knows that there is a "blue light policy" and emergency vehicles are always allowed through. If they are delayed by traffic that is another matter; they can be delayed by traffic whether or not protests are happening. Just last week the Sun and the Daily Mail were corrected by the South East Ambulance Service who said that the protests did not stop them getting to a crash where 2 people died, as the papers had claimed. In fact the crash was 10 miles away, and they came by Air Ambulance. "It's hard to watch and hear this level of arrogance. And the way she smiles sympathetically at people in the audience commenting is not only patronising but really quite sinister. Here is the BBC LINK to make a complaint: https://lnkd.in/eBdKRc_yAnd please share this post if you want to encourage others to know about this and to lodge a complaint too. Thank you. #activism #protests #climatechange #climatedenial #climatejustice Just Stop Oilhttps://lnkd.in/eZjfmh7X

V.S. Naipaul was of the opinion that this was not entirely possible, and probably not even partially. In fact, it may never happen even partially, let alone fully. For he believed that Iran's pre-Islamic Zoroastrian culture and greatness, or Iran's true cultural identity, shared with "Aryan" India, was so thoroughly destroyed that it, to this day, can't be recovered and is essentially defunct. Lots of it or most of it is at the very least irrecoverable. Maybe that explains why they keep reverting back to stagnation and backwardness, especially after their unsuccessful attempts and notable efforts to save and to reclaim their Aryan heritage and the pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian past. Naturally, this hasn't gone unnoticed. Nader Naderpour as cited in Saad 1996 even went as far as to compare the establishment of the Islamic Republic to the Arab Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire, and suggested that it is in fact a continuation of that same defeat of superior Iranian culture. https://lnkd.in/g_g8Dxfc #india #culture #iran #protests #iranprotests2022 #iranprotests2022 😪

🗽 #WelcomeToAmerica ☭ #opinion 🤔America faces a two-front #ideological battle: one at home, one abroad. Victory or defeat on either front will influence the outcome in the other such that any loss is calamitous.Across the battlefield abroad sits the Chinese #Communist Party, waging information warfare dedicated to convincing the world that America is immoral and incompetent to its core. Other authoritarians such as #Russia parrot its assertions. This is part of the CCP’s #strategy to weaken the #UnitedStates and replace us as the strong horse and bend international institutions to its will. America’s willingness to stand as a model of individual #freedom, self-determination, and prospering free enterprise to other countries has been its asset and a cornerstone of the #US-led order. To attempt to draw smaller satellite countries into its orbit, #China seeks to convince them that Uncle Sam has nothing to offer anymore but wokeness, weakness, and #decline.The message is well timed: Americans are fighting among themselves about whether this country and the #globalorder it leads is worth defending. The woke Left doesn’t seem to think so. This is one of the premises of progressive identity #politics. During the Black Lives Matter summer of #protests and #violent #rioting, #activists destroyed businesses and monuments. #Liberal hosts on cable outlets excused the lawless #destruction as morally acceptable due to its “righteous” cause.Elites who hold to this revolutionary framework tell us that math is #racist and that the natural #family and #gender binary are oppressive and bigoted. On Day One in the Oval Office, he signed an executive order “advancing racial equity,” undergirded by the ideas pervasive on the Left that America is an unjust country by design. His most senior Cabinet officials promote the same #message.U.S. #Ambassador to the #UnitedNations Linda Thomas-Greenfield trashed the U.S. in a speech as systemically racist. When the #UN Human Rights Council concluded that the death of George Floyd in #police custody demanded that the U.S. be investigated for #humanrights abuses, Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the #investigation as something we owed to the #world. And when the Chinese delegation, representatives of a #government running concentration camps, berated Blinken for American racism and human rights abuses, Blinken agreed that “yes, we have work to do.” CCP #propaganda seized on Blinken’s equivocation, splashing across its pages a narrative of the “US’ double #standards in human rights.”This #problem is not contained to the Left.Former President Donald Trump routinely draws a #moral equivalence between the U.S. and #authoritarian countries.

The same week as #nationalengineeringday protesters in one of the UK's most affluent towns, built around the river Thames have to protest against Thames Water dumping raw sewage into the middle of the heart of their community. Thank you Russel Brand for bringing attention to this, but as usual the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) are too busy baking cakes and patting each other on the back to even speak about the problem, let alone solve it. If Thames Water can fill the Thames with raw sewage without consequence, there is zero chance of solving the big environmental problems. Water is the least challenging of all process systems, and yet still the engineering in and around the environs of London fails so much that it subjects those around them to literally thousands of gallons of raw sewage dumped into their own river. I can only imagine the disgusting stench of it. Institutions should be tracking down those responsible, disciplining them and stripping them of their credentials, but instead it's all just one big Potemkin Village dumping its own sewage on the public, calling itself a 'charity'. Even after the CoVid-19 focus on hygiene and the prevention of disease transmission.

#ACTIVISM: We spoke about the threat of activism recently in a joint webinar with the Transported Asset Protection Association. In this incident climate activists carried out a coordinated action to block three busy intersections on the A-100 highway in Berlin during rush hour. Activist protests can impact trucks directly if in the wrong place at the wrong time and also indirectly in the form of delays which can mean drivers do not reach their secure parking spot for the night. Trucks parked overnight at non-secure parking areas are vulnerable to cargo theft and fuel siphoning incidents.

Over the last few days, as most of my network probably have, I read about and watched the videos of climate activists pour soup on paintings and glue themselves to museum walls. I had a hard time organising my thoughts on the topic. On the one hand, I understood what they were trying to do. I sympathised with the message. I feel the anger, pain and anguish that the protestors emote. However, I was not sure of the method of messaging. This article is an interesting read. I thought it was well articulated (albeit a little harsh) and argued. Thanks to my colleague, Katherine Kearney, for sharing this article!I'd love to hear different opinions and views on the matter. #climatechange #climateaction #protests

#Bolivia - El departamento de Santa Cruz, la mayor región y motor económico de Bolivia, cumple este martes 11 días de paro indefinido por el censo en 2023 desbordada por la acumulación de basura y la escasez de combustible, en medio del cerco de sectores oficialistas que rechazan la huelga. El paro que impulsan los sectores cívicos y el “cerco” que es promovido por grupos que defienden al Gobierno del presidente Luis Arce tienen a Santa Cruz en una situación crítica entre nuevos pedidos de diálogo. En este marco, trascendió que las Fuerzas Armadas de Bolivia fueron convocadas por Arce para participar en el asedio a Santa Cruz. El Gobierno busca que se produzcan choques violentos para justificar la acción del ejército. En ese sentido, en Santa Cruz, los manifestantes temen que los grupos de choque del MAS decidan cortar el suministro de agua y electricidad. En tanto, grupos violentos avanzan desde la zona cocalera de Chapare hacia Santa Cruz. Luis Arce, tomó juramento este martes al nuevo alto mando militar al que pidió defender al Gobierno “legalmente constituido a través de las urnas”, en medio del conflicto por la realización del censo de población que para el oficialismo es un intento de un “golpe de Estado”. Los nuevos jefes militares juraron el cargo en un acto en la casa de Gobierno en La Paz presidido por Arce junto al vicepresidente boliviano, David Choquehuanca, y el ministro de Defensa, Edmundo Novillo. El general de Ejército Hugo Arandia es el nuevo comandante de las Fuerzas Armadas, el contraalmirante Gonzalo Vigabriel es jefe del Estado Mayor, el general Juan José Zúñiga el comandante del Ejército, mientras que la Fuerza Aérea Boliviana (FAB) está a cargo del general Marcelo Zegarra y la Armada Boliviana bajo el mando del contraalmirante Juan Arnez. Según Arce, “hoy Bolivia se encuentra nuevamente amenazada por aquellos que, incapaces de aportar a la democracia, apuestan por la confrontación y la violencia poniendo en peligro la convivencia democrática entre bolivianos” y que “ponen en movimiento una estrategia para reeditar el golpe de Estado de 2019″. #latinamerica #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #riskmanagement #intelligence

Mobile Apps and Social UpheavalTechnology is a double-edged sword in the fight for the future or Iran. Both the protestors and the government are using apps to achieve their goals. Data shows a 1,000 percent daily increase in the number of Iranians signing up for VPNs to stay under the radar in the crackdown.Protestors in Tehran fear arrest, beatings and even death by joining mass protests demanding more rights and a new leadership in Iran. But a yearning for change and a varied bag of tech solutions, from mobile apps to encrypted chat, have kept them going.Struggling to suppress the biggest show of dissent in years, Iran’s authorities have also turned to technology, using delivery apps, Twitter and facial recognition to track protesters, eavesdrop on opponents and harass women who defy their strict dress code.#technology #change #tech #data #mobileappdevelopment #mobileapplications #mobileapps #apps #protests #socialchange #iran #iranprotests #iranprotests2022 #humanrights #humanrightsviolations #womenempowerment #womensrights #womensrightsarehumanrights https://lnkd.in/esAhTXFV

#ACTIVISM: Climate activists are conducting a rolling campaign of protests on the M25 motorway this week. Activists are climbing overhead gantries which forces the police to close the motorway whilst protesters are safely removed. This is the third day of protests around rush hour which are causing significant traffic disruption. Logistics operators are recommended to factor additional travel time for their shipments, avoid the M25 if possible or avoid travelling on the M25 during rush hour.

Measures around UK public order policing that were defeated in the Police, Courts, Crime and Sentencing Bill are now making their way through Parliament in the Public Order Bill, prompting impassioned debate along the way; Senior Policing Lecturer Owen West MSt (Cantab), a former chief superintendent and public order policing specialist, argues that while the proposals may enthuse government supporters, they are not in the interest of the public or the police service."In what some might say was misdirection from the ongoing political turbulence, Ms Braverman famously derided those who criticised the Bill as ‘tofu-eating wokerati’ during last month’s Commons debate.""It appears the current Home Secretary, through the Public Order Bill, is now seeking to legislate in favour of some of the very tactics that have led to a public inquiry, instigated by a former Conservative Home Secretary.""There are facts to keep in mind here. Firstly, the criminal law already covers these types of protest tactics. Secondly, the surest way to engender and sustain protest activity is to seek to ban or inhibit it."https://lnkd.in/eGpZs22w#lawenforcement #policing #police #publicorder #protests #legislation

Election security preparations are necessarily concerned with the safety of early and day-of voters casting ballots as well as the processing or certification of results, protests that can stem from whether or not a candidate accepts those results or chooses to fan discontent among supporters, or potential attacks against election infrastructure itself or the officials overseeing what may be perceived to be flawed systems or procedures.Source: GTSC's Homeland Security Todayhttps://lnkd.in/edgJ5raN#violence #attack #attacks #extremism #extremists #violentextremism #election #highthreat #threat #threats #infrastructure #CI #tech #technology #protest #protests #civilunrest #unrest #civildisturbance #publicsafety #safety #security

When are the Just Stop Oil protesters going to realise what they're doing is counter-productive? Everybody wants climate improvement and to make their contribution to #netzero (we've cut our home energy and vehicle usage by two-thirds since 2019), but the stress generated for people who have no influence upon these matters, or who miss medical appointments, or who have mental health challenges, will at best cause people and #business to lose money precisely when it's the last thing they need, or shorten lives through consequential medical episodes. Some protests are tone deaf. These are prime examples. Does anybody see Sir David Attenborough super-gluing himself to #roads or climbing motorway gantries? Would anybody doubt the effectiveness of his campaigning...? #mentalhealth #medical #money #energy #oil #economy #m25 #protests #climatechange

#Brasil - Miles de personas se han concentrado este miércoles frente a las puertas de cuarteles en Sao Paulo, Brasilia y Río de Janeiro, para exigir una «intervención militar» contra la victoria electoral del líder progresista Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Las concentraciones, en las que los manifestantes proclaman que «autorizan» al presidente Jair Bolsonaro a llamar a las Fuerzas Armadas, fueron convocadas a través de las redes sociales por los grupos de ultraderecha que apoyan al gobernante y no reconocen la victoria de Lula en las urnas. Las movilizaciones han sido convocadas paralelas a las protestas de camioneros que bloquean carreteras con el mismo objetivo desde el pasado lunes, aunque esas manifestaciones han perdido fuerza después de que el propio Bolsonaro las desautorizó y determinó que el Gobierno inicie el proceso de transición con el equipo de Lula. La protesta de los camioneros que exigen un golpe militar frente a la victoria electoral de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva en Brasil, se mantenía este miércoles, pero perdía fuerza en todo el país, según han informado fuentes oficiales. Los bloqueos de carreteras, que llegaron a ser unos 500 en 24 de los 27 estados del país el pasado lunes, habían caído a 167, en los que la policía negociaba con los manifestantes a fin de liberar por completo el tránsito. El movimiento, que reclama una «intervención militar», comenzó a perder intensidad después de que el presidente Jair Bolsonaro, líder de la ultraderecha, terminó de admitir su derrota al determinar que el Gobierno inicie el proceso de transición con el equipo de Lula.De todos modos, pequeños grupos de camioneros mantenían algunos bloqueos, algunos manifestantes hicieron «vigilias» la pasada noche frente a cuarteles del Ejército y han convocado a algunos actos similares para este miércoles, festivo en Brasil por el Día de los Muertos. #latinamerica #protests #demonstrations #politicalrisk #countryrisk #riskmanagement #intelligence

“From the #ArabSpring in 2010–11 through #Sudan’s 2019 #revolution, protests in the #region have often erupted in the wake of the #deaths of young #men. This is the first time in the region’s recent #history that a nationwide uprising has been ignited by the death of a young #woman—and one from an #ethnicminority group, no less.When #women are on the frontlines, mass #movements have a higher chance of succeeding and are likelier to lead to more egalitarian #democracy. This is one of the reasons today’s #protests are so threatening to the Iranian #regime.Movements in which women play a prominent #role tend to attract much larger numbers of participants. On average, they are about seven times as large as movements that sideline women—and larger movements are more likely to succeed.”#MahsaAmini#WomanLifeFreedom

The current protest at Amsterdam airport is crossing a dangerous line. Of course, protest is important to voice your convictions, even if it inconveniences others.However, the current events are not only affecting the super-rich in their private jets. According to the news, a medical flight had to be redirected to another airport because it couldn't land in Amsterdam. Such a redirection of a medical transport can have life-threatening consequences because the subsequent transport of the patient to the hospital must now be improvised and takes longer. Every additional minute equals an unnecessary risk. That's why we call for different means of protest in the future.#amsterdam #schiphol #protests

Climate change and political unrest are giving rise to increasing protests, globally and in the UK.So what do you do if employees skip work to join a mass protest? Even those who have a previously unblemished unauthorised absence record? Employees can’t expect to skip off work to protest and not face repercussions. You need to make it very clear that they have to book holiday to take time off to protest. If they do go AWOL or pull a sickie on the day, you need to attempt to contact them and document everything. Alternatively, if you see them on TV clearly out and about as part of a protest, press record and ring us for advice.If however, the issue is climate change and your company ethos plays a part in addressing this, actively communicate it to staff so that they feel they are already contributing. Want more advice? Call us today on 0345 6349154 or email SELondonNKent@hrdept.co.uk #HR #Employees #workplace #protests

Two Upside-Downs (Commentary): Mondrian & Climate Protestors in Art Museum(s) “The recent discovery that a picture by the Dutch (and, latterly, New York) painter Piet Mondrian has been hanging upside down in the German museum where it has lived for half a century seemed to evoke, nostalgically, an earlier and more predictable era in the polemics of museums and modernism. “Ha, ha! You see?” the wags used to mutter on these occasions. “They can’t even tell which way is up!” And the defenders would feebly mutter fixed avant-gardisms in return.… The Mondrian is doubly potent for us now, since it is called, of all things, “New York City 1,” and comes from the artist’s blissful New York period, which also produced the masterly “Broadway Boogie Woogie” and the “Victory Boogie Woogie”….The controversy over the upside-down Mondrian arrives at a moment when other, not quite companion, controversies about the uses and abuses of art works and the museums in which they sit have been roiling around. A squadron of loosely organized climate-change activists has been entering museums to trash famous pictures, including at least one by Mondrian’s hero, Vincent van Gogh….In the particular case of van Gogh, no human being in the forty thousand years of humanity has ever been more inspired to ecstasy by experienced nature, and none has ever been a humbler companion in the struggles of ordinary people or inclined to ennoble them in art. If the protesters wanted to fall to their knees in reverence before a van Gogh, and then glue their hands to the floor, they might have a cause to make and recruits to add. Making van Gogh the enemy—and no amount of high-stepping rhetoric can make an assault on his pictures somehow apart from an assault on him—is nuts.”https://lnkd.in/eHqV8K4R FROM our group, “Art Museums and Art Galleries: News, Reviews and Collections” ( https://lnkd.in/dweM6GQ ).

"Until 2018, domain fronting enabled by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft allowed web users to circumvent internet bans and surveillance. Will they reinstate it in Iran? ... “One thing people don’t talk about is domain fronting,” says Mahsa Alimardani, an internet researcher at the University of Oxford and Article19, a human rights organization focused on freedom of expression and information. It’s a technique developers used for years to skirt internet restrictions like those that have made it incredibly difficult for Iranians to communicate safely. In essence, domain fronting allows apps to disguise traffic directed toward them; for instance, when someone types a site into a web browser, this technique steps into that bit of browser-to-site communication and can scramble what the computer sees on the back end to disguise the end site’s true identity. ...The likelihood that Amazon or Google will reinstate domain fronting depends on “how cynical you are about their profit motives versus their good intentions for the world,” Hunstad adds."#medialiteracy #mediapsychology #cybersecurity #iranprotests2022 #iran #iranianwomen #iranian #humanrights #google #amazon #microsoft #protest #protests #freespeech #surveillance

was grateful when the student editors of the Penn State Journal of Law & International Affairs extended an invitation to speak as part of their Fall Speaker Series. For my remarks I chose the topic of law, lawfulness, and direct mass participation in political orders, focusing on the example of Cuba-The topic is worthy of sustained examination beyond the usual discourse that is often seduced by the interests of great powers to use these as an instrument for the projection of power abroad, or as a discourse of insurrection, lies, hooliganism, and disorder when manifested internally. Cuba provides an excellent example in two respects. First it suggests the way that states can institutionalize and to some extent naturalize even a spontaneous explosion of popular expression. Second, it also suggests the ways in which such explosions, when ignored or suppressed, can produce instability, not for the nation, but for the operation of an inattentive state apparatus. There are lessons here for all states, including the great powers. The abstract adds a little detail:Abstract: On 11 July 2021 mass protests erupted across the country in ways that had not been seen since the success of what became the Marxist-Leninist revolution of 1 January 1959. The protests represented an important challenge to the inertia that had characterized Cuban Marxist Leninism since the start of the 21st century. It was forcefully suppressed. At the end of September 2022 Hurricane Ian plunged much of Cuba into darkness as the national electrical supply was compromised. Days later, without power restoration, mass protests erupted all over Cuba. This time the police and security services did not respond in the same way. his presentation considers the ramifications of potentially radical transformation protest Cuba. It weaves together a number of critical stands that now produce an effort to accept and internalize at least a limited role for popular protests, while suppressing the rest. To that end the presentation will consider interlinkages between the move to popular consultation and referendum in Cuba, the 11 July protests, and the reshaping of the cultures of protests in 2022. The implications of these changes remain contested—for the United States and the Cuban diaspora the changes point to the eventual triumph of some form of liberal democracy in Cuba; for the Cuban establishment, the changes point to a much needed reform of the political system.The PowerPoint that accompanied the remarks are included. #cuba #protests "From 11 July 2021 to Hurricane Ian in 2022: The Transformation of Mass Protests in Cuba and its Consequences"; Remarks Delivered Penn State Journal of Law & International Affairs Speaker Series 25 October 2022

What it's like to be fighting on the frontlines of the Iranian protests. #womenlifefreedom #protests #womensrights
-----------------------------
#iran #women #protests "Antigovernment protests in Iran gathered strength Sunday with new demonstrations in scores of cities and indications that unrest was growing, posing one of the biggest challenges the country’s conservative Islamic rulers have faced in years.A movement initially led by young people that focused on the country’s strict Islamic dress code for women appeared to be broadening into a mass outpouring of pent-up dissatisfaction among middle-class workers and even religious Iranians at the regime’s treatment of its own citizens.The nightly street clashes between security forces and protesters that have erupted in dozens of cities since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody on Sept. 16 for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, properly have shown no signs of abating, despite an intensifying crackdown and a mounting death toll.As the unrest grew, Iranian security forces cracked down on the demonstrators, using tear gas and live rounds to disperse the crowds. Some protesters have violently clashed with the security forces. Authorities have disrupted access to the internet in an attempt to block the social-media networks on which the protesters have relied to express dissent and rally support.At least 41 people have been killed so far, most of them protesters, as police escalated the use of live ammunition. In Tehran neighborhoods, shouts of “death to the dictator,” referring to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, could be heard Sunday night even from residents not actively participating in the demonstrations.

"Protest activity will likely increase—possibly significantly—on October 26 to commemorate the 40th day since the regime killed Mahsa Amini. #Protest organizations such as the neighborhood youth groups have continued to call for countrywide demonstrations on October 26.[1] Many protest organizations continue to use revolutionary rhetoric in describing the planned demonstrations.[2] Iranians commonly hold a commemoration on the 40th day after a death. Anti-regime protests similarly erupted 40 days after security forces killed Neda Agha Soltan—a young Iranian protester—during the Green Movement in 2009.[3] Security forces killed Agha Soltan on June 20, 2009, and the commemoration was on July 30, 2009.[4]The regime has likely prepared to preempt and crush the planned #protests on October 26, especially given their potential to strengthen the protest movement. The regime will likely disrupt internet services and telecommunications in the early morning throughout Iran to stymie protester coordination and organization. The regime will also likely deploy #security forces ostentatiously throughout major cities to deter and intimidate demonstrators and use force if the protests gain traction.Protesters may coordinate further demonstrations against the Islamic Republic for the 40-day commemorations of other secular martyrs, such as Nika Shakarami and Sarina Esmail Zadeh, in this protest movement.[5] Forty days after Shakarami disappeared is October 30, and 40 days after Esmail Zadeh died is November 2."

Iranian lawmakers demand ‘no leniency’ for protesters as mass demonstrations continueIranian lawmakers have urged the country’s judiciary to “show no leniency” to protesters in a letter cited by state-run Press TV on Sunday, as thousands of people continue to rally on the streets despite the threat of arrest.The Islamic Republic is facing one of the biggest and unprecedented shows of dissent following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman detained by the morality police allegedly for not wearing her hijab properly.In an open letter signed by 227 of Iran’s 290 members of Parliament, Press TV reports the lawmakers calls for protesters to be taught a “good lesson” to deter others who threaten the authority of the Iranian government.“We, the representatives of this nation, ask all state officials, including the Judiciary, to treat those, who waged war (against the Islamic establishment) and attacked people’s life and property like the Daesh (terrorists), in a way that would serve as a good lesson in the shortest possible time,” the letter read according to state-run Press TV.Lawmakers added that such a punishment – the methods of which were not specified – would “prove to all that life, property, security and honor of our dear people is a red line for this (Islamic) establishment, and that it would show no leniency to anybody in this regard.”Iran has charged at least 1,000 people in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in the nationwide protests over Amini’s death, the largest such show of dissent in years, state news agency IRNA has reported. Their trials are public and have been underway for more than a week.UNICEF United Nations#مهسا_امینی#Mahsa_Amini#people #police #protest #security #property #protests #riot #police #acab #policebrutality #alllivesmatter #politics #nojusticenopeace #justice #tyranny #freedom #wakeup #liberty #communism #dictatorship #newworldorder #government #agenda #nwo #truth #a #socialism #constitution #fakenews #freeyourmind #lies #fightforyourrights #mindcontrol #corruption#jordanpeterson #people #security #property #protests #riot #acab #policebrutality #alllivesmatter #politics #nojusticenopeace #justice #speak #freespeech #fear #fearless #fearofpublicspeaking

Iran’s crackdown on #protests and #drones to #Russia raise questions for the EU: how to reconcile condemnation of Iran with EU interests in regional security and nuclear non-proliferation? Read this new JOINT Brief by Riccardo Alcaro ➡️ https://lnkd.in/dPv5W8iQHere some take-aways:🗒️Many in EU (and elsewhere) pin their hopes on the protesters succeeding. However, there is not yet sufficient evidence pointing to the fall of the Islamic Republic🗒️The EU may be tempted to call off talks to revive the nuclear deal, which had stalled already before protests, and join the ‘maximum pressure’ policy Biden has inherited from Trump. Yet maximum pressure has been an utter failure🗒️Containment seems obligated choice as Iran has seemingly opted for aligning with Russia (and China) in an anti-US coalition, yet Iran and Russia continue having quite diverging interests, especially on the energy front🗒️The EU response had best be calibrated so as not to deprive the clerical regime of any incentive to engage again in nuclear and regional diplomacy🗒️This policy response is far from satisfying. It is not even certain that it will bring results. But at the time of writing, it strategically appears to be the wisest path to take

Despite a widening crackdown, including an ominous ultimatum from the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps this past Saturday that it would be "the last day" of the #MahsaAmini #protests, defiant Iranians continue to take to the streets across the country. What impacts could the protests in Iran have across the Middle East, both for pro-democracy and human rights activists in Arab countries and their widely repressive governments? To understand the potential implications beyond Iran, Democracy in Exile asked a wide range of experts and observers.“There is a precedent for this sequencing of events where demands for structural political change in Iran reverberate and inspire similar political demands in the Arab world,” said Nader Hashemi of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver.“Iran’s ongoing protests will have considerable impact on the entire Middle East, not just Iran’s Gulf neighbors,” Seifeddine Ferjani, a Tunisian political analyst, explained reverberations in Tunisia. “It may create another wave in the region, a sense of inevitable change.” “For pro-democracy and #humanrights #activists, the Iranian struggle is not just a struggle of #women seeking autonomy, but also of minority ethno-religious groups seeking equality and representation in the nation,” said Marsin Alshamary, an Iraqi-American researcher.Others disagree. “For Gulf activists and reformists, there is sympathy and amazement for the bravery of the women protesters in Iran. But the moment is not auspicious for a wave to join them,” explains Kristin Smith Diwan, scholar at the The Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “Woman, life, freedom—all three await full realization across the Gulf.” Read the roundtable to learn from more experts— https://lnkd.in/efVKS34p

Last week i had the privilege to meet and interacts with many #youths ,climate change ambassadors and  government officials etc. What really stood strongly in me is climate justice.  Climate justice has become a popular term at #protests and strikes. But what does it mean, how is it a "green" issue and why are we focusing on it now? My take is; Climate justice recognises the climate crisis as a #social  and #political problem, as well as an #environmental  one. It acknowledges that different #communities feel the effects of the climate crisis differently, and that the responsibility for the crisis rests with some countries and companies more than other. #climatechange #climatejustice #climatefinance #climateeducation #lcoy#wwf #youngo

Social Justice and the BlockchainThe Blockchain presents a decentralized peer-to-peer network where people can access transaction records. Blockchain technology can be constantly updated and verified by its users, also known as peers, but other people with access cannot change records. The ledger in a blockchain system sits within a  network of peers connected for a common purpose, once again without a central administrator.We can use this technology for data storage, identity management, supply chain management,  financial inclusion, and various other applications.Blockchain has the potential to be used for social justice through information management, cash transfer, crowdfunding management,  delivery coordination, supply chain tracking,  programming, and humanitarian financing. Transparency and accountability are two existing challenges in humanitarian assistance that technology can address.In the #endSARS movement,  despite sanctions from traditional financial institutions, the Nigerian activist group FEMCO raised money in 2020 using blockchain technology; funds in the form of cryptocurrency were transferred and used for protest materials and resources.In recent weeks, parts of Nigeria have experienced flooding. FacesofWeb3  is creating a Website and NFT collection to raise awareness about the situation while we wait for the government to take charge and provide relief to these survivors.These few instances demonstrate that blockchain adoption can be a catalyst for social impact and not just wealth creation.As wonderful as this sounds,  safety precautions should be utilized when making financial decisions. There is still the possibility that scammers will use their anonymity to commit fraud, and hacks and manipulation may occur. I'd like to hear your thoughts on social justice and how the block chain aids certain movements. #Cryptpcurrency #socialjustice #protests #blockchain

An interesting speech that seems to have had all the "ingredients" to convince, and yet the link that connects the whole speech is completely missing. Obviously, I'm trying to tell you everything without saying anything."The President of the Republic of Moldova, Maia Sandu, delivered a speech in the Romanian Parliament, where she warned that for Russia there are no limits or rules, so “we are all in danger”. “If, through their courage and love of the nation, the Ukrainians did not stand up to the Russian Federation, where would Russia go? To the Dniester, to the Prut?” said Maia Sandu. She emphasized that the citizens of her country want to be part of the European family and have the chance of a life in freedom and peace.Maia Sandu attended the international conference “Parliamentary women from Romania and the promotion of gender equality as a national commitment”, organized by the Parliament of Romania.“For me, in these times, it is a huge responsibility, I will do everything I can so that the Republic of Moldova is on the good side of history so that people can live in peace, free and dignified at home. I am honoured to be here today and I can thank Romania. We ardently want to be part of the big European family. For three decades we have stagnated in a grey area. Our citizens no longer want to live in the grey area, without the chance of a normal life, a normal life as they saw in European countries. We want to be a zone of freedom and peace, we appreciate the help and know how to do our duty as European citizens. Moldova is already contributing to a stronger and more united Europe by effectively participating in managing the effects of war,” Maia Sandu said.“Today, our citizens live with concern for the future of their children. Russia started a war because it thought it was allowed to do anything. If the Ukrainians did not stand up to the Russian Federation through their courage and patriotism, where was Russia going? To the Dniester, to the Prut? (..).“In these tragic times, we rely on the free world, so that in the future the free world will rely on the Republic of Moldova, as a guarantor of peace and security. This is what the free and brave people of this land honestly fought for, valuable people who fulfil their duty, who work honestly, who want to be respected at home, and who say “please” and “thank you”. Today, on behalf of the Republic of Moldova, I say “thank you” and on behalf of all our citizens “please”. (..)."#moldova #maiasandu #energycrisis #poverty #protests

#Colombia - Miles de personas marcharon este sábado por las calles de ciudades colombianas como Bogotá y Medellín para mostrar su desacuerdo con el Gobierno de Gustavo Petro y sus medidas, como la reforma tributaria que quiere impulsar en el Congreso. Unas 8.000 personas salieron de diversos puntos de Bogotá hacia la céntrica Plaza Bolívar, que acoge el Congreso, donde, con banderas de Colombia y pancartas entonaron el himno de Colombia y gritaron «Petro, bandido, el pueblo está ofendido», pidiendo su renuncia, o arengaron a las fuerzas militares. Según la senadora uribista el Gobierno «está poniendo unos impuestos exagerados y prohibiendo la exploración de petróleo y gas que está llevando el sector de hidrocarburos, que es la base de la macroeconomía de este país, al colapso», haciendo referencia a los anuncios -algo contradictorios- del Gobierno de paralizar nuevas exploraciones de hidrocarburos como un gesto hacia el medioambiente. El presidente de la Unión de Trabajadores de la Industria Petrolera y Enérgica de Colombia, Alejandro Ospina, aseguró que es falso que haya que acabar con esta industria para «mitigar la crisis climática» y que eso solo traerá «mayor pobreza y mayor impacto ambiental». La oposición asegura que la reforma tributaria -que en 2021 ya sacó a decenas de miles de personas a las calles en unas multitudinarias protestas cuando el expresidente Iván Duque quiso impulsar una tributaria algo diferente- «puede destruir el sector productivo de este país». Por eso piden al Gobierno que «escuche a la ciudadanía» y continúe el legado que han dejado otros gobiernos porque «no puede llegar a destruir», en palabras de Valencia. #latinamerica #protests #demonsrtrations #politics #countryrisk #intelligence

Gunpowder Day – November 5, 2022Who said “Remember, remember the fifth of November”?Taylor Gibbs wrote the infamous,“Remember, Remember the 5th of November,Gunpowder treason and plot.We see no reason,Why gunpowder treason,Should ever be forgot!”HOW TO OBSERVE GUNPOWDER DAY1)Light a bonfireWhen night falls, commemorate the day by lighting a bonfire and soaking in the warmth of the flame. Not only does a bonfire provide warmth, but it is also a beautiful sight, provided it is safe.2) Watch (or read) “V for Vendetta”“V for Vendetta” is famously inspired by the Gunpowder Plot. The dystopian classic is a fun watch.WHY GUNPOWDER DAY IS IMPORTANTA)It sparks an interesting thought exerciseThe Gunpowder plot is an example of what people are willing to do when faced with persecution.

Domestically and internationally, Modern Iran is a far cry from the seat of civilization it once was. As protests continued across Iran last week, a number of Iranian-made kamikaze drones were fired by Russian forces at targets in Kyiv, a major European capital city. It marks the first time that these Iranian weapons have been used against a European capital, as well as a new low for relations between Iran and the West - which were already under strain.So how did we get to this worrying point in history? To find out, I invited the excellent Professor Ali Ansari (University of St Andrews) onto the Warfare Podcast to hear about the history behind modern Iran - from the Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War, to the nuclear deal torn up by ex-US President Donald Trump.Listen to the History Hit Warfare Podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts, and via this link: https://lnkd.in/e8ntpaD #iran #history #iranprotests2022 #ukrainecrisis #russiaukrainewar #drones #warfare #protests #podcast #research

💥”The Chief Medical Officer should not have been qualified as his own expert in a case initiated by him to enforce orders authorized and issued by him”💥(👆My favourite line in the court documents!!) 🇨🇦🔺On May 14, 2021, the CMO of Health and the previous NS Liberal provincial government sought an ex parte injunction to stop the 3 anti-mask protests that were planned for that weekend… —> but the anti-protest injunction actually applied to “everyone in the province at any time in the future”.🔺Which meant there were no public gatherings allowed for 2 months (which is when the govt eventually lifted the injunction)🔻! But not before the CMO openly stated that he had wanted groups to stop gathering to ‘prevent misinformation about the pandemic’ 🤦‍♀️🔴”This was an important legal principle that we wanted to pursue, that governments shouldn't be able to go to court and get this broad anti-protest order without having compelling evidence, and without the order being appropriately tailored to the circumstances," said Cara Zwibel, director of the fundamental freedoms program at the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.#sweepingpower #government Article links in comments #courts #canada #health #stress #freedomfighters #freedomofchoice #freedomtoprotest #religiousfreedom #truckersforfreedom2022 #alberta #freedomconvoy #EndTheMandates #novascotia #legal #civil #pandemic #protests #billofrights #canadians

I am relieved to see that the violence in Chad seems to be subsiding after the October 20th Protests. Nonetheless, the root causes of the discontentment are still there: the National Dialogue has officially come to an end, with no concrete results, other than the current military President extending his mandate for two years, rather than transferring the power to a civilian government as promised. For now however, we face a situation of deep human rights abuse by the government, who responded to the protests with excessive violence, conducted arbitrary arrests, many of whom amount to enforced disappearances. Torture and murder are still widespread in the prisons of Chad, and though 50 persons have officially been killed, I fear more will not come out alive of their often absurd and unjustified arrests. Hissène Habré might have been prosecuted, but Chad is still not escaping a violent heritage, nor putting in place the mechanisms against it. And let's not forget N'Djamena is still facing devastating floods. Here's to my courageous friends from Chad. #HumanRights #Chad #TransitionalJustice #EnforcedDisappearances #Protestshttps://lnkd.in/eu32iTtW

When you post about Iran, you might wonder if it’s ok to write about politics here on LinkedIn. You know what? The answer is YES! We mean by “politics” the people’s business – the most important business there is. Politics and business go hand in hand and both belong here on LinkedIn. Company’s economies is influenced by our political climate. The business climate is affected by the economy.The revolution in Iran has resulted in protests and campaigns and all sorts of engagements worldwide. Near 8 million people around the world, Iranian diaspora, are deeply affected by what Iranians inside Iran are going through. This has caused havoc with many of our day-to-day operations. More and more people regardless of nationality, gender and believes are getting involved and show their solidarity with the Iranian people. Companies should keep tab on the political climate and pay attention to the posts about Iran, why?- Because trustworthy companies/organizations has a duty to safeguard human rights and stand with people against oppressive powers. - Duty of care in the workplace is more important than ever, and now is the time to ensure your organization isn’t left behind. New expectations and demand for showing your standpoint can arise. You need to be ready and create a response plan. - Your behavior and decisions can have a larger effect on your relationship with your clients, employees, suppliers and other businesses. You who excuse yourself for posting about Iran, go ahead, no excuses are needed. Challenge your fear of what might happen on the other side of the criticism. In our modern society fixation with other peoples opinion about what we post become counterproductive and limiting. I quote Desmond Tutu, South African civil rights activist:"It means a great deal to those who are oppressed to know that they are not alone. Never let anyone tell you that what you are doing is insignificant." #business #linkedin #society #humanrights #economy #iran #protests #raisingawareness #human #trust #solidarity

Some people say that the protests from Chisinau are not "for democracy(?)" but against it,  that the protests are "staged & paid" by the Russians, or by pro-Russian parties, while others are saying that the so-called West camp, in this context: Maia Sandu +  Zelenskyy + Ursula etc, is to be blamed for the critical situation of the economy, etc.   In other words, the protests are interpreted according to the camp to which the dis/information source belongs, officially or not.  But no matter how they are presented, one thing is clear: the series of crises caused by the current security situation in the region deepens the discontent of people who do not make politics but are hit by the decisions of those who do. In the case of the Moldovans, their economic situation is much more precarious; they are much poorer than other Eastern Europeans, and keeping in mind that a large part of the Moldovan workforce used to work in Russia before February 2022,  of course, now, they are directed affected by the strained relations between Moldova and Russia. As such,  these days they see themselves stuck, like the citizens of many other regional states, between the interests of powers that don't give a damn about them, their daily piece of bread, etc. Of course, the real protests have yet to start en masse in Europe. If things continue to go in this direction, I estimate that in the first three months of next year, many protests will degenerate into real security crises.#moldova #protests #poverty #unemployment #inflation #war #geopoliticalgames "Protests again in Chisinau, Moldova, the people calling for the resignation of President Sandu and the normalization of relations with Russia.

#Irán - Una de las mayores protestas en contra del gobierno tuvo lugar el miércoles en Irán desde que comenzaran las manifestaciones hace seis semanas. Miles de personas tomaron las calles en las principales ciudades y otros puntos del país para marcar los 40 días de la muerte de Mahsa Amini, una joven kurda iraní de 22 años que falleció mientras se encontraba bajo custodia policial. Amini había sido detenida por llevar supuestamente el velo de forma "inadecuada". Su muerte, ocurrida el 16 de septiembre, generó una ola de protestas consideradas como el mayor desafío a la república islámica desde que se instauró en Irán en 1979. Los líderes de Irán han presentado los disturbios como fomentados por extranjeros. En la capital, Teherán, se encendieron hogueras en las calles, mientras cientos marchaban por una calle principal coreando consignas como "Muerte al dictador", una referencia al líder supremo de Irán, y que se ha convertido en un estribillo que se repite en las marchas. En respuesta a las protestas, la República Islámica ha respondido con violencia. Según la organización de derechos humanos Iran Human Rights, basada en Oslo, al menos 234 manifestantes, incluidos 29 niños, han sido asesinados por las fuerzas de seguridad durante la represión en las protestas. Además, el Estado ha amenazado a los manifestantes con la pena de muerte, en un intento por poner fin a las marchas. #iran #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #intelligence

BBC [excerpt]: Footage has emerged showing what appear to be rare large-scale #protests against strict Covid-19 measures in the Tibetan regional capital, #Lhasa.Multiple videos on #socialmedia show hundreds demonstrating and clashing with police. They are said to be mostly ethnic Han Chinese migrant workers.The city has been under #lockdown for nearly three months as it battles a wave of infections.#Tibet is one of the most tightly guarded regions in China.The protests are said to have taken place on Wednesday afternoon and stretched on till the night.One video shows hundreds of people gathered on the streets, with officials blocking them at one end. A message calling for calm can be heard on a loudspeaker, with an official asking for people to "please be understanding and to go back".Another video shows scores of people on the streets at night, and a man can be heard commenting on the scene."[They] have been locked up for too long. And a lot of people in this community are people who have just come to work and earn money. If they could get that in mainland China, they wouldn't have come here," he says in Mandarin.Yet another video showed people marching in the streets with the caption "We just want to go home".The BBC was unable to independently verify the videos, which have been removed on Chinese social media but reposted on #Twitter.Tibetan sources have told news outlet Radio Free Asia (RFA) that protesters warned they would "set off a fire" if restrictions were not lifted - though it is not clear what this meant.Another source said there were fears that scuffles between civilians and police officers could turn violent.#news

After living and working in #Russia for several years, she returned to France in 2018 and became interested in the #GiletsJaunes (yellow vests) #protests that were happening in the country. The following year she was scheduled to deliver a lecture on the French movement at a conference in Russia but was refused entry by the border guard. That is how she learned she had been banned from Russia for 10 years, "in order to ensure the defence or security of the state." 🗞️A Sociologists Perspective in Mayday Magazine 2022🖌️Teresa O'Connell

All Souls DayWHY ALL SOULS DAY IS IMPORTANT1) It’s about caringAt the end of the day, All Souls’ Day holds the true meaning of caring for and remembering those we have lost. This can be in a larger sense, as in sending a prayer out for those who have lost their lives in war or etc. or a very narrow and personal sense such as sharing stories about a late grandparent, and everything between.HOW TO OBSERVE ALL SOULS DAY1) Tend to a friend or relative’s graveAcross denominations, it is considered customary to visit a loved one’s grave on All Souls’ Day to lay flowers or tidy up the grave site from fallen leaves and other detritus. While you’re there, take a moment to reflect on the deceased’s life and works#مهسا_امینی#Mahsa_Amini#riots #protest #protests #riot #police #acab #policebrutality #alllivesmatter #politics #nojusticenopeace #justice

"Iran’s Judiciary spokesman Massoud Setayeshi says Iranian authorities made more arrests in the case of detained French spies and managed to obtain #valuable “ #strategic information” from them.Speaking at his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Setayeshi said the newly detained individuals are accused of “conspiracy and collusion” to harm national security.He said the case has different dimensions and is under a thorough, fast-paced investigation.However, the spokesman did not clarify how many more arrests had been made nor give their nationalities or any other details.In a video aired on Iran’s Arabic-language television news network al-Alam TV earlier this month, the two French spies arrested in Iran some four months ago admitted to their attempts to provoke anti-government protests and riots with the ultimate goal of putting pressure on the country’s Islamic establishment.(..)"#nationalsecurity #iran #france #spies #protests

#Bolivia - El Comité Cívico de Bolivia rechazó nuevamente la propuesta del gobierno de Luis Arce de instalar mesas técnicas para fijar la fecha en la que se celebre el Censo por lo que el paro se mantendrá activo en la octava jornada de protestas en Santa Cruz. El presidente del Comité Cívico, Rómulo Calvo, afirmó tras la reunión celebrada este viernes en la ciudad de Cochabamba, en el centro del país, que el gobierno “sigue subestimando el sacrificio de una población que está exigiendo un derecho”. “Han querido callar la voz de un cabildo, la voz de un millón y medio de personas, que pidieron una fecha, una fecha que le hemos dicho al pueblo boliviano, no se negocia”. El Gobierno se ha hecho el sordo; nos ha demostrado que no tiene voluntad para dar solución”, señaló en declaraciones recogidas por el periódico de Santa Cruz El Deber. El representante sostuvo que lo que el Ejecutivo ha puesto sobre la mesa no responde a lo determinado por el Cabildo que señala que el Censo debe realizarse en el 2023. El denominado “movimiento cívico” de Bolivia inició el pasado sábado un paro nacional indefinido para demandar la celebración del Censo en 2023, en lugar del 2024 como ha propuesto el gobierno boliviano, ya que esta estadística condiciona el reparto de registros entre las regiones del país. #latinamerica #demonstrations #protests #countryrisk #intelligence

On October 25th, Sudanese protestors took to the streets to march against the decision to stop a democratic form of government in Sudan. Sudanese expressed their outrage over the economic crisis that erupted by marching toward the presidential palace in Khartoum. Amidst these protests on the anniversary of the military coup in Sudan, internet services remained blocked until 6 pm. In these protests, the posters in hand had faces of the 116 people who participated in the anti-coup protests and were killed in a crackdown last year.Read the full article here: https://lnkd.in/d7TNm2bH#Sudan, #Economy,  #Military, #Inflation, #Protests, #AntiDemocracy, #Civilians #people

#Irán - El comandante en jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria de Irán, Hossein Salami, advirtió este sábado 29 de octubre a los manifestantes que esta jornada sería la última de las protestas que iniciaron hace más de un mes por la muerte de la joven Mahsa Amini. Una señal de que las fuerzas de seguridad podrían intensificar su represión en medio de los disturbios que asolan al país. La mayor ola de protestas en Irán en años irrita a las autoridades, que amenazan con acabarlas. Este sábado 29 de octubre, el comandante en jefe de la Guardia Revolucionaria, el general Hossein Salami, advirtió a los ciudadanos que las manifestaciones pronto tendrían que acabar. “Hoy es el final de los disturbios. ¡No salgan más a las calles! (…) Le estamos diciendo a nuestra juventud, la minoría de ustedes que han sido engañados, detengan los actos malvados”, sostuvo Salami. La amenaza se produce en momentos en que la Policía y otras fuerzas de seguridad intentan contener de forma violenta a los activistas, con munición real, perdigones antidisturbios y gases lacrimógenos. Hasta el momento la Guardia Revolucionaria no ha sido desplegada, por lo que muchos temen que tras las declaraciones de su comandante en jefe la represión aumente. Sin embargo, los iraníes han desafiado las amenazas a lo largo de la revuelta popular, en la que los jóvenes y las mujeres han jugado un papel destacado. #iran #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #riskmanagement #intelligence

A new report from The Intercept  reveals details about the Iranian government’s far-reaching digital #surveillance tools, uncovering how officials partner with mobile carriers to track cell phone users, and monitor, alter, and disrupt their #communications.As #software program imposed on Iranian mobile companies allows the government direct access, SIAM allows mobile operators to track users’ locations and restrict their #data usage.The tools can:𝙨𝙡𝙤𝙬 𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙠 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙧𝙮𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙤𝙛 𝙥𝙝𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙫𝙞𝙙𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙨 𝙤𝙧 𝙡𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚 𝙜𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙥𝙨𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙙𝙪𝙘𝙚 𝙙𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙙 #𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙙𝙖𝙩𝙖 𝙨𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙬𝙝𝙤 𝙨𝙥𝙤𝙠𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙬𝙝𝙤𝙢, 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚Such a system could help the government invisibly quash the ongoing #protests — or those of tomorrow — an expert who reviewed the SIAM documents told The Intercept.“SIAM can control if, where, when, and how users can communicate,” explained Gary Miller, a mobile #security researcher and fellow at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. “In this respect, this is not a #surveillance system but rather a #repression and control system to limit the capability of users to dissent or protest.”#hacktivism #digital #help #university #respect #iran #mobilesecurity #cybersecurity #cyberthreat #humanrights

Interesting turn of events...I assess this will not help to improve the current financial situation in China. "More than 210 people, including legislators, journalists and union leaders, have been arrested under the law and a colonial-era anti-sedition statute, mostly for crimes related to speech. More than 10,000 people have also been arrested over their involvement in the 2019 protests for crimes ranging from rioting to unlawful assembly."#china #hongkong #protests #crackdown #2019 #business #businessanalysis #finance #law #people

“Thousands of Ethiopians staged nationwide demonstrations on Saturday to denounce what they referred to as foreign interference and pressure in the country’s internal affairs, local media reported. In the capital Addis Ababa, demonstrators carried banners that read “A threat to Ethiopia is a threat to the world” and “respect the sovereignty of Ethiopia.”Other banners had words accusing the US of disrespecting Ethiopia’s sovereignty.“Foreign countries need to stop meddling in the internal affairs of Ethiopia and should refrain from supporting rebel forces, in particular the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and its allies,” Jantrar Abay, deputy mayor of Addis Ababa, told the crowd, according to local daily Addis News.The sovereignty of Ethiopia must be respected, Ethiopians will continue to stand in unity to safeguard the sovereignty of their country, he added.Protests were staged in other major cities of the country.The demonstrations came on the back of mounting pressure on Addis Ababa following resumption in August of fighting in northern Ethiopia between government forces and the TPLF rebels after a five-month truce.(..)”.  #ethiopia #protests #foreigninterferences #addisababa #tigray #tplf #sovereignty

Who can protest? Did you know that only an interested party can file a protest? An interested party is an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. This is usually a potential bidder of a solicitation, or an actual bidder not selected for further evaluation or award.   What are the protest venues? An interested party typically files a protest either directly with the Agency or with GAO. These two options are typically less expensive and come with time restrictions where a protest should be resolved; 35 days for Agency protests and 100 days for GAO protests.  An interested party may also file with the COFC.  However, it is the least common method due to the lengthy time to resolution and costly legal fees.  What are allowable grounds? Protests must have sufficient grounds to be considered.  They include issues such as defective solicitations, including allegedly restrictive specifications, omission of a required provision, cancellation of a solicitation, and ambiguous or indefinite evaluation factors.  When must a protest be filed? Generally, an agency protest challenging the terms of a solicitation must be filed before the time for receipt of initial proposals. In other cases, a protest challenging the award of a contract must be filed within 10 days after contract award or within 5 days after a debriefing date offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request, whichever is later.  My company filed a protest. Now what? If an interested party submits a protest, an Agency or GAO representative will validate the protest was filed within established timeframes, has acceptable grounds, or follows guidelines related to the value of the effort and type of error disputed. GAO is the most popular venue because they have 100 days from the point of filing to issue a decision. However, once the Agency is notified by GAO of the protest, it may take corrective action at any point.  Remedies often include reevaluation of proposals or amendments to the solicitation or revision and re-issuance of a solicitation. If the Agency takes corrective action, the GAO will dismiss the portion, or totality of the protest related to the corrective action taken. In cases where the Agency does not believe it made an error and the GAO finds otherwise, GAO may sustain the protest, in whole or in part. If the protest is sustained, the GAO will direct the Agency to take corrective action. If the GAO denies a protest, it means they determined the Agency acted reasonably and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation. Protests denied by the GAO can be appealed by the interested party to the COFC. #FARFriday #federalacquisitionregulation #FAI #GAO #COFC #protests #govcon #governmentcontracting

What happened: Right after ECP announced the decision to disqualify Khan, PTI supporters' headed over to the streets showing support for the party leader. Later, on October 21, Imran Khan released a video noting that the party workers should focus on the long march on Islamabad and called off the protest by his supporters.More: Political pundits had a mixed reaction to Khan's video statement, as Cyril Almeida, in a tweet, wrote, "So NOW he doesn't want to protest? More than a little suspicious, what deal is being cooked up?" At the same time, other social media users claimed that there were no such protests, but social media only hyped it up. Also: Talking about the Long March, Khan noted, "I will give you a call for Long March and this will be the country's largest protest movement. This movement will not stop until the rule of law is established in the country." Report by: News Desk #Propergaanda #Gaanda #SiyasiGaanda #Pakistan #ImranKhan #LongMarch #Protests

I am also sorry for the situation in Iran and I indeed support the protests for freedom in Iran. I also see many social media posts calling for the international community to support the protests. On the other hand, I am very doubtful about the ability of the international community may really change the situation in Iran.  Because the formation of the UN Security Council is obvious and any resolution against Iran will be blocked by Russia and China. Sanctions? They are still in force and sanctions against Iran mostly put Iranians' daily life in more difficulty rather than the regime in Iran. (Sanctions against Iran have supplied also propaganda fuel for the regime.) There is no harm in calling for support from the international community. But in my opinion, the better strategy is to call for strikes that will be started by Iranian small business owners and workers. The same way was realized in Iran during the Iran Revolution in 1979. Shah Pahlevi's power was weakened mostly by the small business owners' strikes. (By now, there is some news about strikes throughout Iran but workers' strikes cannot be powerful enough because workers' unions in Iran have potential but not power. ) I hope the change in Iran happens peacefully and I hope freedom comes soon. #iran #protests #demonstrations #sanctions #usa #russia #china #middleeast #news #iranprotests2022 #mahsaamini #workers #sme #politics #diplomacy #foreignaffairs

In #Moldova, once again there are anti-government #protests of the #Shorovites.The #fact of organized transportation and financing of these actions by a #politician with a dubious #reputation, who is ready to cooperate with anyone in order to come to power, has already been proven and repeatedly recorded. The day before, Moldovan law enforcement authorities detained about two dozen middle-level organizers of these protests, who provided funding on the ground.Many people wonder why the Shorovites did not come up with something creative, having such millions and a crisis in Moldova against the backdrop of the security situation in the region, which is a source of anxiety and uncertainty in the near future. Purely political interest.I am convinced that in fact the main goal is to increase the contradictions in society.Not Sandu. Not elections.The very forcing of the situation between people, between different social groups, between regions.That is why every time there are attacks on journalists, there is a senseless blocking of the streets, aggressive behavior and attacks on passers-by.These are all horizontal actions that are systemic in nature.The resignation of the government in this context is a desirable but not so necessary goal.It is much more important to increase social tension, transfer it to the subjective level, which in itself will paralyze communications and the work of public authorities in the future, which will make the situation uncontrollable.Do you recognize the handwriting?I think that the chances for this are extremely small, but it should be understood that in transitional countries, such as #Moldova, #Russia is acting precisely because of the exploitation of democratic forms, undermining trust between people.And then - laid out eggs in different baskets, imitating an alternative. And the game is already under this pattern, but it does not go beyond 20%.

#Bolivia - Por quinto día consecutivo la próspera provincia de Santa Cruz y bastión opositor en el oriente de Bolivia mantenía el miércoles un paro por tiempo indefinido en reclamo de un censo que le permita mayor presupuesto y más escaños en el Legislativo. Bandos a favor y en contra de la protesta se enfrentaron el miércoles con petardos y se lanzaron piedras en un populoso barrio de esa ciudad, que permanece casi paralizada. Avenidas y calles estaban bloqueadas, las clases fueron suspendidas, no había transporte y comercios y oficinas estaban cerrados. Decenas de camiones permanecen en las carreteras. Al menos dos personas resultaron heridas en la refriega, según el reporte de los medios locales. Unos minutos después llegó la Policía que separó a ambos grupos con la utilización de gases lacrimógenos y una barrera de motocicletas, sin embargo, la tensión se prolongó por varias horas más. La situación en esa ciudad de casi dos millones de habitantes parecía agravarse con un corte de rutas por parte de sindicatos afines al gobierno que rechazan el paro. “Estamos indignados con el Comité Cívico y el gobernador de Santa Cruz y ahora se va a paralizar todo”, sostuvo el dirigente campesino oficialista Franklin Vargas. Autoridades temen que el suministro de alimentos y combustibles merme en esa y otras ciudades. El paro ha sido convocado por el poderoso Comité Cívico -que es contrario al gobierno del presidente Luis Arce- y por el gobernador opositor Luis Fernando Camacho, quien ha responsabilizado al mandatario por aplazar hasta 2024 el censo que debía realizarse en noviembre de este año. Las autoridades afirman que “técnicamente” no es posible hacer el empadronamiento en 2023 como reclama Santa Cruz. Según analistas un nuevo censo le daría a Santa Cruz mayor representación legislativa y le permitiría tener más peso en las decisiones políticas. El gobierno de Arce busca demorar el empadronamiento para que la nueva redistribución de escaños en el Poder Legislativo no merme su fuerza política en las elecciones presidenciales de 2025. #latinamerica #protests #demonstrations #politics #countryrisk #intelligence

Pressure group’s protest stalls business in Shillong.The city of Shillong has been facing violent protests by pressure groups including HYC, HANM, EJNC, JSM and Corp. Tight security arrangements have been made by the administration after the FKJGP rally that turned violent on the city streets. The protests have been under control for some while now. Four pressure groups under the banner of “Save Hynniewtrep Mission” have still staged protests in two different locations of the city-one near the SP office and the DC office point- in the city. The demands of the protestors include the introduction of ILP in the state, inclusion of the Khasi language in the Eighth schedule, review of the inter-state boundary MoU with Assam, relocation of Harijan colony, CBI or Judicial probe into the killing of Late Cherristerfield Thangkhiew and filling up of the vacant posts in Government Departments.

WOMEN, LIFE, FREEDOM: PROTESTS CONTINUE TO SPREAD IN IRANIn this week's edition of A World in Motion (AWIM), we take an in-depth look at the protests in Iran - their origins, influence and impact.From a Christian perspective, we look at what Jeremiah 49 says about Elam (Iran) and what it could mean for Iran and its people, and those of Iranian believers, both within the country and abroad.Read more:https://lnkd.in/dtFm34zx#Iran #protests #women #aworldinmotion #IranRevoIution2022 #christian #christianperspective #news

#Ecuador - El estallido de 18 días de protestas sociales lideradas por indígenas en Ecuador que dejó al menos 7 fallecidos y unos 600 heridos entre manifestantes y agentes del Estado, y pérdidas económicas calculadas en unos 10 millones de dólares, fue revisado en audiencia el lunes ante la Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH). La instancia que vigila el cumplimiento de los derechos fundamentales en el continente por mandato de la Carta Interamericana, citó a los demandantes de la sociedad civil y la representación del Estado para tratar 'Las protestas sociales y pueblos indígenas en Ecuador'. Los peticionarios argumentaron que las protestas no pueden desligarse del “contexto que enfrentan los pueblos indígenas” donde la “pobreza y falta de garantías” les han empujado a ejercer su “derecho de respuesta”. Y agregaron que los planes expansivos del gobierno, como la ampliación de permisos en las zonas de extracción minera y de explotación petrolera, se han concentrado en mayor parte en las tierras ancestrales, lo que ha generado mayor contaminación de recursos naturales y les deja sin alternativas. La discusión ante la CIDH surgió a solicitud de la Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) y de la Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas de la Amazonia Ecuatoriana (CIONFENIAE), entre otros grupos de defensa de los pueblos originarios. “La población indígena representa el 7 % de la población del Ecuador” si se toman los datos del Censo más reciente, que data de 2010, y si se miden los indicadores de pobreza concentra "la más alta en el país arriba del 25 %" denunciaron. A ello se suman otros fenómenos sociales como las migraciones ante la reducción de su hábitat que está golpeando a estas minorías. #latinamerica #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #politics #intelligence

It's becoming increasingly clear that the slimy republic is on its way out.As with any regime that is widely reviled and has lost every shred of legitimacy, it is resorting to desperate measures to maintain its elusive grip on the country.At this point in the process, that involves turning on the very people that it claims to be serving.We all know that when tyranny becomes law, revolution becomes a duty.Iranians of all backgrounds have been taking part in the Zan, Zendegi, Azadi (Woman, Life, Freedom) protests for weeks.They want their country back.They want the thugs who have captured the state to take their perverted belief system purporting to be a religion and go.The Iranian Revolution was the last great social experiment of the 20th century and it has failed.On flights out of Iran, women remove their head coverings as soon as the airplane leaves the Iranian airspace.Very few Iranian women wear any sort of head covering or hijab when they are outside Iran.The forced compulsion is an illusion and cannot work.If the nikah mut'ah loving and secretly pork eating adulterers pretending to be pious who have captured the state in Iran know what's good for them, they'll take their perversions and go.The alternative is being crushed by the unstoppable march of history.#motivation #inspiration #strategy #bestadvice #gettingthingsdone #future #politicsandlaw #freedom #freedomofspeech #censorship #authoritarianism #protest #protests #hijab #humanrights #Iran #intolerance #tyranny #revolution #ExUngueLeonem

I first read this book a few years ago, when Trudy Knowles and I were sharing our work in progress on a reading site. I was impressed with the story and Trudy's writing. Radishes and Red Bandanas is a story about the redemptive power of love to heal in times of tragedy and about the importance of speaking out no matter the cost. It is set during the Vietnam war and chronicles the protests, conscription, and human toll in that time. #writing #power #memoir #memoire #powerfulstories #vietnamwar #protests #socialissues Read more about it on my blog.

#CARGOTHEFT: A highly organised cargo theft gang struck four parking areas during a single evening targeting nearly 40 trucks along the A2 and A14 motorways in Germany. This resulted in 32 trailers having their curtains slashed and goods stolen from three other vehicles including bicycles valued at EUR 11,600. This highlights the capability and intent of professional cargo theft groups who strike hard in the night and then move on to another area to avoid additional scrutiny from roving police patrols. Operators can reduce their risk of cargo theft by employing TAPA TSR protocols to secure their trucks and cargo and protect their driver and park at secure parking, particularly for overnight stops.

#Chad - Al menos 60 personas murieron este jueves y 300 han resultado heridas durante las protestas organizadas en Chad. Los manifestantes se reunieron en las principales ciudades del país (Yamena, Mondou, Doba y Sarh) para expresar su descontento por el mantenimiento en el poder de los militares. Las fuerzas de seguridad comenzaron disparando gases lacrimógenos contra la población civil, aunque poco después utilizaron munición real para dispersar a los manifestantes. Treinta personas han muerto en la capital, Yamena, mientras el resto de las víctimas se distribuyen entre las ciudades más importantes de Chad. La mecha se prendió después de que pasaran los 18 meses prometidos por el actual Presidente del país, Mahamat Déby Itno, para convocar unas elecciones democráticas que permitieran a la ciudadanía escoger a su líder. Mahamat Déby es el hijo de Idriss Déby, militar y político chadiano que gobernó el país con mano de hierro desde 1990 hasta su muerte en combate en 2021, momento en que su hijo tomó el poder. A principios de este mes de octubre, Mahamat se retractó de su promesa y prolongó hasta 2024 el plazo para convocar elecciones, algo que ha enfurecido, comprensiblemente, a los esperanzados chadianos que sueñan con una democracia plena. Chad lleva sufriendo una concatenación de dictaduras, golpes de Estado y guerras civiles desde su independencia, hechos todos estos que ha aprovechado el Gobierno para calificar las manifestaciones de “ilegales” y posteriormente de “insurrección”. Sin embargo, las imágenes facilitadas apenas si muestran cómo los manifestantes queman algunas barricadas para protegerse de los disparos, mientras son las fuerzas de seguridad las que hacen un uso desproporcionado de la fuerza. #africa #protests #demonstrations #countryrisk #riskmanagement #intelligence

It will take some time for #shipping backlogs to be cleared. The United National Transport Union (UNTU) and Transnet reached a three-year wage agreement on 17/Oct. Allied Workers Union (SATAWU) condemned the deal while later calling off its #strike suddenly and returning to operations on 20/Oct.Impact: port operation resumed, shipping backlogs to be cleared - The #covid control of #China Ningbo Beilun #port area has been gradually lifted since 20/Oct. with several #depots and consolidation #warehouses being approved to resume operation.Zhengzhou, a key air cargo hub, also went into partial #lockdown on 17/Oct., and part of the city Xi'an has been put into #lockdown impacting 13 mil people.Besides, it's signaled there's no looming change to China’s zero-Covid policy at the recent 20th National Congress.Disruption: delays, manufacturing - The longshore workers at the #Port of #US Mobile’s breakbulk and general cargo docks have postponed a possible #strike against the local stevedoring company in charge of those operations after the two sides agreed to federal mediation.

The IMF and the Tunisian government have reached a tentative agreement to unblock a $1.9 billion loan, and the Tunisian gov. commits to a “comprehensive economic reform program” including more taxation of the informal labor sector. Though the release of funds should provide relief to the heavily indebted country, the protests are expected to continue and reach a peak in Dec. and Jan.Disruption: unrest, possible fuel and food shortage again before the release of IMF funds

Last week we shared news of the FREE training event we are delivering on Friday 4th November on 'Understanding Protester Threats at Cultural Venues'. On Sunday, the threat has appeared to continue...At the Museum Barberini in Potsdam, Germany, two protesters from Letzte Generation threw cans of mashed potato at one of Claude Monets painting, Meules. The painting is currently on a permenant loan from its owner who had bought the painting at auction for $110.7 million. This is just one of several protests carried out at cultural venues around the world, including the UK, Italy, Australia and now Germany. They are asking for the government to act on the growing concerns of climate change and global warming following the hottest summer on record across Europe this year.This is just one of the cases we will be dicussing at our FREE training event in just 11 days time!

#SocietyAndCulture #politics #people #VoxPopuliAlmost six weeks after the death of Mahsa Amini, the unrest in #Iran shows little sign of abating.Defying #security forces, thousands marched to her grave in the northwestern city of Saqqez on Wednesday, as crowds clashed with security forces on the streets of the capital, #Tehran, and several other major metropolitan areas.On Thursday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported attacks on #government buildings in the city of Mahabad, as one of the boldest challenges to the clerical #leadership that has been in power since the 1979 #revolution shows little sign of slowing down.“The #authorities are clearly nervous and shaken from the ongoing #protests,” Arshin Adib-Moghaddam, a professor in global thought and comparative philosophies at SOAS University of London, told NBC News on Thursday via email.“Any effort to shut down the legitimate right to mourn the death of an innocent #civilian was always likely to fan the flames of #resistance even further,” he added.

What is important to understand about #animism is that it is not a #religion per se, nor is it a matter of merely believing that a mountain or a glacier has a soul. Animism describes practices that establish a #relationship between #places and #people, usually one that recognizes places, #animals and #plants have #power over people.There is a wide range of practices that contemporary scholars consider to be animist, ranging from rules about what you can and cannot do near a #glacier and making offerings to the spirit masters of Lake Baikal to representing the will of mountains in political negotiations.In all these instances, #rituals establish relationships of #obligation that tie humans to the #land, and the land to the humans who live on it. Instead of #humandominion over the landscape, in animist #cosmologies, humans live under the dominion of the landscape around them.Animism is not a religion one can convert to but rather a label used for worldviews and practices that acknowledge relationships between nature and the animal world that have power over humans and must be respected.These practices can be religious rituals, but they can also be forms of #environmentalcare, farming practices or #protests, such as those conducted by the water protectors at Standing Rock, known as the No Dakota Access Pipeline, also called by the hashtag #NoDAPL. Protests like the #NoDAPL aren’t what most people are used to thinking of as “religion,” and, as a result, media accounts often miss the  obligations to place and land that motivate protesters.New Zealand’s 2017 act recognizing the Whanganui River as a #legalperson, the culmination of decades of #Maoriactivism, could be described as animism taking a legal form. Additionally, when #Indigenouspractices are labeled animist religion, it is easy to overlook the very real biological and ecological scientific knowledge of these communities.#religion #anthropology #knowledge #sustanability
