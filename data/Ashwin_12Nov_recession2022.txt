Can you survive a recession? News in the UK is warning us there's a recession coming. Atlas started in 1991, in the middle of a recession, and we've weathered a few storms since then, including the fall out after the Brexit Referendum. So what can we do to keep going? Is it making you feel worried and anxious? That feeling never goes away, I can honestly say that. If you want to get ready  for whatever is ahead (do not do nothing or bury your head in the sand), I'll be sharing a few tips next week, aimed at freelancers and small businesses alike. Meanwhile I am drinking tea aplenty and doing some final preparations on my talk with Olivia later on today at the Language Show online. #Recession2022 #RecessionTips #TranslationServices #BusinessManagement #LITranslators

This is the first recession that I am experiencing after my employment, and its a first for many of you too.I see people getting laid off and struggling to find a job and it is really sad to see how it is turning out to be. I follow stocks and I see many companies going down on stock prices as well.In this hard time, many of us are still blessed to have a job. Sometimes I feel very grateful to be still here.Sometimes, moving ahead is getting to stay where you are so that you can move ahead later.Its basically gratitude for this small thing that we might overlook multiple times, only to realise how our entire lives and responsibilities are dependent around it.Think about it.#gratitude #layoff #meta #recession2022

After massive layoff in Twitter, here comes the news from Meta. I wonder why such large companies can't handle this better by seeing it ahead of time and planning accordingly.

Very Tough time for Private Job Seekers especially IT and Tech Industry. Continuously news are coming from Reputed Organizations like Twitter, Meta  Wipro, Infosys, Byjus for #layoffs due to various reasons #moonlighting. Believe me this list will going to increase day by day. Only GOD knows where it is going to stop and when.LinkedIn is flooded with messages for requesting help for Jobs.Those people who never accept friend request are now expecting help from others. This is high time to help each others. Just Like Corona, it is invisible disease which is impacting most of us #recession2022 Big Learning for all of us. Time never remains same for anyone. So we should always extend our help for others. Let's be practical. Never fly so high and Don't try to avoid others. In this unpredictable scenario, if you are getting a good hike in an Organization which is less stable as compared to your current Organization, Don't take a chance to switch over just because of hike because Big fish are 1st target everywhere. Last but not the least,  Let's pray to GOD to give enough strength to bear any kind of loss and also help us to come out of such situation very soon if arises.For all the latest job opportunities follow me or Hire Nation

What can we expect from the economy in 2023? "The battle for France is over. The battle for Britain has just begun."That historical reference was part of the answer world renowned economist Dr. Gary Shilling gave to a question posed by P. Cory Hogan, Chief Revenue Officer of Lob during yesterday's Collective[i] Forecast . Cory's curiosity kicked off the conversation that is on the mind of every sales (and business) leader. How long will this downturn last? (Listen for his question and Dr. Shilling's thoughtful answer...) Cory and Dr. Shilling's interaction reinforced why we host these incredible conversations. Shared insights (Collective Intelligence) is key to how we all adapt and succeed in a world moving that's uncertain and accelerating. It also highlighted the quest of great sales leaders seeking intelligence to inform how they forecast.  That quest is why Collective[i] exists. Our forecast looks beyond opinions and history to the real time data points that are leading indicators of changing market conditions. (DM me for more details). Our application is the eyes and ears every sales professional needs to win. Collective[i]'s mission, our business model, our AI/patented technology expand access to the intelligence that fuels prosperity. I'm proud to participate in a community where a world renowned economist and Chief Revenue Officer connect the dots between what's happening in the world and how we as leaders and companies adapt. As an aside, what you don't see in this clip is the awesome exchange about beekeeping and maple syrup. That magical moment was shared by the people participating live. Don't miss the next one! On December 7, we'll feature American Economist, Senior Fellow at Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs and Senior Lecturer at Yale School of Management, Dr. Stephen Roach.

High inflation, high interest rates and low cash availability has proved disastrous. This whiplash effect of grow at all costs to cut at all costs continues. But what‚Äôs the middle ground?Of the scaling businesses we‚Äôve spoke to, their number one priority is generating revenue and number two is finding operational efficiencies.For many it feels like they‚Äôve got one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake. ‚Ä®‚Ä®On the one hand, they must deliver growth through business agility by innovating at pace. On the other, they need to deliver a resilient organisation; one that‚Äôs stable, secure and predictable. The three main things holding them back to find those operational efficiencies are siloed business units and the data they hold, legacy systems and traditional ways of doing things.So the skew of focus is on the thing that‚Äôs easiest out the two for them - driving more growth. Their operations then starts to drift from the leading edge of the business. From here, their situational awareness becomes poor and they‚Äôre steadfast in being reactive, lacking the visibility of key insights to become proactive.So how do you prepare to fight external factors if, as my co-founder Ben Ford puts it, ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt have your own shit in one sock‚Äô?Mission Ctrl has a few ideas üí° #COO #recession2022 #data

Bubbles are like cancer, they‚Äôre better off quickly detected and quickly killed.The 2022 recession is an asset price bubble which is slowly bursting. Auto Loans might follow the mortgage loans' decline trend, & it's a blessing in disguise.Let's understand the detailsWhy did asset prices increase?The used car prices index sky-rocketed by almost a whopping 100% in 2021. Because excess liquidity was pumped into the system during Covid, which increased inflation. ¬†How did the bubble burst & ConsequencesThe rate hikes by the FED are taking down the big-ticket loans first - mortgage loans, auto loans, next could be credit cards As the interest rates skyrocket, people reduced buying cars, which is pulling down the bubbled-up car prices. The auto loan delinquency rate has reached its highest in the decade 1.65% (60 days DPD). And this isn‚Äôt a good signal¬†Auto Loans are not home loans, where people wait till the last breath to save the house. They let go of the vehicle, if they find the value negative i.e. loan payment outstanding > market value. This could trigger a massive cycle of delinquencies and foreclosures, leading to systematic issues. Although the auto loan market is a fraction compared to real estate, it still remains the second biggest item in the banker's asset basket.Looking Ahead¬†The good news is FED's rate hikes are being impactful - inflation reduced to 7.75 in Oct-2022 from 8.2 in Sep-2022. The FED might reduce rate hikes in the coming months, if not stop them completely. ¬†But, this doesn't solve the asset price bubble issues. Car prices will certainly plummet. Since they bloated up due to excess liquidity. But, this short-term pain is a blessing in disguise, the earlier the less intense it is. That's why, Bubbles are like cancer, they‚Äôre better off quickly detected and quickly killed.¬†Hopefully, all the bloated assets get back to their normal valuations smoothly ‚Äì so that we can get back to normal without any major problem#foreclosure #autoloan #recession2022 #mortgage

I am sure you all are seeing every other post related to the #layoffs from quite a sometime on your feed.As we entered the period of recession majority of the companies will start either freezing their hiring or releasing their employees.The next couple of quarters will be very crucial for all the job seekers and employees working in any organization globally.Everyone is talking about the layoffs, and no one is discussing on how to deal with the recession.There are couple of ways I think we all should follow for coming days:1. Upgrade yourself with the latest technologies and skills in your domain.2. Give your 100% at work.3. Build your network via LinkedIn, meetups etc.4. Generate additional income streams.5. Start savings for the coming months and stop excess expenditures that can be avoided.6. Be a helping hand for all those who are suffering from layoffs or in search of a job.Remember: "When the skies are looking bad and your heart's lost all its hope,after dawn there will be sunshineand all the dust will go".Do comment out if you have any point for addition.

Considering the horrifying scenes of layoffs happening around, the very first goal you should have in the next 3 months is to build a stable additional income source (apart from your 9-6 job) that's dependent on a skill that you are good at and enjoy doing.

Great stuff here Tom Kutilek! I love the consideration for Market Share in a potential recession. The market for your product may have shrunk, but it didn't dissappear. If your competition is reducing spend significantly their presence in the mind of the consumer reduces as well. This creates an opportunity for brands to grow their market share and introduce themselves to new customers and create loyalty with a new group of consumers.

Firing and Layoffs, have become a trend these days. Looks like, it's become another marketing agenda. And it no more feels like a 'flag' rather it comes as a "limelight News". The constant firing and lay off stories across organizations is upsetting and somehow promoting toxicity. Rather than focusing on such "cost cutting" measures what if we incorporate 2-3 more humane and ethical standards in our practice which will be a win-win situation for everyone in the economy:1) Why not make "hiring process" stringent enough so that we have the right talent pool with us.2) Why not have a long-term organization vision and growth plan with right stats and projections to further avoid such morally inappropriate actions like layoffs or voluntarily retirements.3) Why not inculcate trainings, nurturing and shuffling employees into other departments to balance out the P&L and departmental business goals.Also, these layoffs are impacting economy, deteriorating trust and parallelly rising more and more mental health challenges.Do you think there are better ways to fight recession and economic downturn rather than layoffs?#workplaceculture #economy #recession2022 #economynews #economy2022 #layoffs #layoff #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters

Dear Recruiters,It's not time to increase your follower list (Only few not all !!) . Many associates lost their jobs due to lay-off, Many freshers got their offer letter revoked. Many are fighting with their financial crisis.There are many posts on LinkedIn for past few days quoted "We are hiring" "Freshers can apply".. So instead of telling like "double-tap on the post I will check your profile" "comment on this post to reach you", Please provide the Job URL directly so that candidates can apply on it. Its impossible for you to view all the 4k candidates profiles whoever like and comment on your post to evaluate your requirements.It's time for us to support among ourselves not to get maximum likes and comments for your posts. And the saddest thing is many Top MNC's Senior HR's are doing the same.Please don't ignore their resume as this is someone's hope and life‚ù§Ô∏èLet's start helping impacted people.

How funny is that after covid this is another pandemic called "Hire and fire pandemic". Covid k baad ji bhar k hiring karo and then fire karte time ek bar b na socho. Looks like this pandemic is airborne too, corporate airborne - spreading all across. Hope all of these companies are doing a fact check that how much spend on other things in the office premises or over all as extra they do before coming to the conclusion of layoff directly. No one wants 5 star food pantry, luxury resting area, thousands of travelling etc to name few. Also if the really money is the problem, management can always be open to its employees about it or go for a pay-cuts through a mutual understanding, instead of removing them totally from their places. Well everybody can't become a ENTREPRENEUR & depends on their monthly salary only. So this not a joke, but if only the decision makers can understand that. #layoffs #recession2022 #management #entrepreneur

Another Layoff Accenture Fired 10,000+ Employees due to Fake Documents.Source: https://lnkd.in/dhNyyt8Q Submitting the fake experience or fake documents for getting a job is not new. With the recession, Companies found multiple reasons to terminate employee.1. Fake Experience - were company and HR not aware earlier ?There is a word Background check which is mostly done by MNC, so how they had hired this much employees without check.¬†2. Moonlighting - was it not happening before ?After Covid-19 when companies started giving WFH, it was happening but now it is highlighted & become the reason to fired employees.Instead of terminating employee by these reasons, they should first find the institute & companies who are providing fake experience certificate & letters to the candidates and blacklist them. And for candidates also It‚Äôs better to join any Startup and get experience then move to MNC's. Avoid Fake Experience & certificates for Joining MNC's.

Earlier this year, there had been rumblings of a worldwide recession, and now the concerns are getting louder and louder. Although there are worries that the United States might push the entire economy into a recession by the middle of the following year, experts think the majority of the globe is already in one.Reference: CNBC#economy #reference #recession #recessionproof #kpmg #worldbank #recession2022 #morganstanley #budget #jpmorganchase

With Twitter firing 7500, Meta 11k, Microsoft 1k, Coinbase, Seaget, Lyft Netflix already cutting costs with their workforce mgmt, the only thing that these companies can do best is probably the timings of firing their employees.For whatever reason they say, TIMING is the key because it gives other Organisations reason to follow and thus creating Ripple Effect automatically causing RECESSION.MY TIMELINE IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE FIRED AND LOOKING FOR A JOB WHICH DEFINITELY IS NOT A GREAT SIGN FOR HEALTHY ECONOMY.

#RizngProYou're hearing the phrase often "Inflation is rising". The most current data from the research tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy show that India's unemployment rate declined to 6.43% in September 2022, the lowest level since August 2018, and after reaching a one-year high of 8.3% in August 2022. In the US, the Federal Reserve's monetary policies may be a factor in whether a recession will occur. With the looming threat of a recession, are people ready for what's to come? Chakri Lokapriya opines that there is no such thing as medium-term decoupling in an economy. India is pretty active when it comes to imports and exports. If there is a recession worldwide, oil prices fall down and with strong demand, oil prices go up. He remarks that a recession would increase the fiscal deficit of India. He also brings up the point that there may not be such a thing as a real decoupling of an economy.¬†In this interview, Chakri explores whether this is a real recession or a technical recession, how India reacted with COVID-19 dissipating, whether this was engineered by the US government, whether inflation in India may be an engineered number and more. #recession2022 #inflation #rizngpro

Layoffs have been in the news lately. These layoffs can be due to a variety of circumstances. How to handle it üëáTwitter¬†was a result of a shift in leadership, which resulted in a change in strategy, whereas Byju's was down to its inability to secure the next round of funding and sustained cash burn. On the other hand, Facebook's layoff was motivated by the anticipation of a possible recession.To delve deeper into Facebook's case, I believe that the layoff was motivated by a foresight of a possible future recession, which clearly means that Facebook is anticipating a decrease in revenues, which means less spent on ad budgets for Large, Medium, Small, and Microenterprises in the coming months. It has to reduce its resources, which unfortunately were its own workforce.Also, Facebook, Amazon, and numerous other companies aggressively hired in 2021 as part of a hiring rush to meet rising business demand amid the COVID-19 crisis. History repeats itself, and as the clich√© goes, supply and demand dictate the market. When there is less demand and a poor forecast of revenues its natural for companies to layoff.As¬†#YuvalNoahHarari¬†said, ‚ÄúThe most important skill of the 21st century is the ability to reinvent yourself‚Äù. If you have nothing to lose and have a positive attitude about life, the circumstances will conspire and make things work for you.Rather than thinking and worrying about a layoff, stay positive not all companies will axe their workforce. Build yourself from within, stay informed, stay sharp, and be nimble. Be willing to restart and reinvent!What do you think about these forecasts? How to be prepared?Leave a comment and tell me what you think.#leadership¬†#success¬†#strategy¬†#facebook¬†#amazon¬†#work¬†#future¬†#metalayoffs¬†#twitterlayoffs¬†#yuval¬†#layoffs¬†#recession2022¬†#recession¬†#jobloss

Perfect example of "Bubble Burst". During COVID when most of the sectors faced the heat, one sector gained momentum and everybody started talking about new normal.Few months before COVID, Edtech companies like byju, unacademy etc emerged. Every second person was showing up interest in establishing intermediaries like Practo, Policy bazar, Zomato etc. in the name of Entrepreneurship. Companies started shifting from traditional marketing to digital marketing, a buzzword like Data analytics was on everybody's tongue.Now, everybody knows what happened to Zomato share, Byju had to start offline tution centre, unacademy is restructuring, IT sector has been corrected by nearly 20-30% ( more is expected in near term).#recession #recession2022 #layoff #elonmusk #elonmusktwitter

Recession is an economic term that refers to a period of time when there is a decrease in economic activity. This can be caused by many factors, such as a decrease in consumer spending, an increase in taxes, or a decrease in production. The main reason that big companies are firing employees is because of the recession. The recession has caused a decrease in demand for products and services, which has led to a decrease in revenue for companies. To cut costs, companies are forced to lay off employees. In addition, the recession has also caused a decrease in consumer spending, which has led to a decrease in sales for companies. As a result, many companies are struggling to stay afloat and are forced to lay off employees in order to stay in business.There is no exact number of employees that have been laid off by Twitter and Meta till date, but it is estimated that the number is in the tens or hundreds of thousands. The message of Mark Zuckerberg to laid off employees from Meta was that the company was going through tough times and had to make some difficult decisions. He told them that he was sorry for the way things had turned out and that he hoped they would understand.When we can expect stability or the end of the recession?"This is difficult to predict, as it depends on several factors, including global economic conditions. However, most economists expect the recession to end by 2022." So, what do to after being laid off?Refer to this article by Harvard Business Review  :  https://lnkd.in/dC_2rbxdLinkedIn -#recession2022 #business #sales #linkedin #business #taxes #pandemic #unemployment #coronavirus #jobloss #layoffs #linkedinnetwork #hiring #layoffsandjobreductions

People, companies and financial institutions knew it all along, what and how they are doing is not correct, not ethical and sometimes even plain wrong. But still they do it.They usually fail to listen only because of one reason, plain impunity, having 'might' of what they deem fit!Anything propped up not on 'fundamentals or facts', but by window dressing and mileage gain from 'point of view', is bound to fail. Market model based on profitability and net capital creation by real services and products, new technology capital investments and sustainable  ventures are the future, if we are to learn the humble way!

Last week I shared some ideas for why marketing in a recession is important. But you might be thinking, great ideas, but let me see some success stories. Here are four case studies of brands (Kellogg's, Toyota, Pizza Hut/Taco Bell, and Amazon,) that came out on top during economic recessions, courtesy of Hawk Media. Let me know which one you found most interesting. Case Study 1: Kellogg‚Äôs Doubles DownKellogg‚Äôs has long been a staple of households and breakfasts worldwide. In the 1920s, it was a rival company, Post, that had the most market share in ready-to-eat cereals.However, during the Great Depression, Post cut its advertising budget significantly. At the same time, Kellogg‚Äôs doubled its advertising, with large investments in radio ads and positioning of its new product, Rice Krispies. The¬†investment in snap, crackle, and pop paid off, with Kellogg‚Äôs profits increasing 30 percent and the company becoming the market leader.Case Study 2: Toyota Addresses Energy CrisisSkyrocketing fuel prices and inflation plagued the U.S. #economy for several years in the mid-1970s. The energy crisis meant long lines at gas stations and concerns about the high costs of driving. Auto loan rates also rose sharply, as high as 17.5 percent.¬†Into this fray, Toyota debated what to do about marketing, including considering cuts to the advertising budget.Instead, the company chose to lean into its advertising, emphasizing its line of fuel-efficient vehicles and smaller cars. The gamble paid off as¬†Toyota surpassed Volkswagen¬†as the top import carmaker in the United States in 1976.Case Study 3: A Fast-Food ShiftIn the 1990-91 recession, McDonald‚Äôs chose to slash its marketing and promotions budget. At the same time,¬†Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chose to pivot. Pizza Hut and Taco Bell added and marketed new products, such as a stuffed-crust pizza and a taco value menu. This paid off, with Pizza Hut and Taco Bell seeing sales increases of 61 percent and 40 percent, respectively. For McDonald‚Äôs, sales dropped by 20 percent.Case Study 4: Amazon Changes How We ShopAmazon has been on the cutting edge of innovation and messaging for years. During the Great Recession of 2009, the company actually saw its sales grow by 28 percent. How? By focusing on new products, especially e-books. The3 company advertised digital books as a less-expensive, more convenient option, and consumers bought in. Introducing its new Kindle reader led to a spike in digital book sales and in on Christmas Day of that year, as those new devices were opened, the company saw more sales of electronic books than printed books for the first time.While all of these examples may not directly be relevant to your company, I think it's proof that in economically turbulent times, you can come out on top. I always like to think of the Warren Buffet quote, "Be greedy when others are fearful. And be fearful when others are greedy." #marketing #recession #recession2022 #advertising

Just 6 months ago, after the PANDEMIC ebbed, we had a JOB MARKET which was on fire, with TALENT being offered 5-10X of their CTC with joining bonus, perks, permanent WFH, unlimited PTO, ESOPS thrown into the compensation & benefits package. Job seekers were sitting on 4-6 offers & bargaining with recruitment/HR teams. Companies were jittery & chewing nails till the candidate(s) would onboard, as this was adversely impacting their product lines & customer deliverables.But now, we are seeing TECH GIANTS and STARTUPS slashing jobs across the board in the thousands from California to Bangalore. RECESSION which was a low whisper under the surface since a couple of months, has now hit BOLDFACED the global economy, with TECH spend being the first to be cut in organizations.LAYOFFS, sadly don't have an appraisal note attached, as it has nothing to do with INCOMPETENCE and LACKADAISICAL attitude but with the DOWNTURN.2022 has been like a SEE-SAW experience.

The business world is in a state of panic as a result of the impending sense of doom in the market. With expenditures being reduced and new projects being halted, many companies are struggling to stay afloat. However, data can be used as a tool to help businesses navigate through this difficult time.When everything else fails, can data help you sustain and stay profitable during a recession? The answer is YES!¬†As we enter into uncharted territory, it is more important than ever for businesses to have access to reliable information. Data provides businesses with the comfort and familiarity they need to make informed decisions during these unprecedented times. However, raw data alone is not enough; it must be transformed into valuable insights through effective data lifecycle management.We‚Äô 'd love to hear your thoughts about this, so please do let me know in the comments#data #management #business #recession #recession2022

Would you take a salary hit to preserve your colleagues' jobs and keep your company or department together?It's layoff season once again.While pundits are saying it's not going to be on the order of what we saw during 2008-09, it's still going to impact many companies.Tech is probably the bellwether, and the article linked below from Business Insider (paywall) summarizes the top tech company layoffs so far this year.But I'm not reading any stories about companies that respond to uncertainty by first tightening _everyone's_ belt so that the entire company can continue to function without the impact of a big layoff.Arguably, the disruption caused by a big layoff has an impact on morale, cohesion, trust, and productivity.  After all, why give it your best when you could be the next head on the block?What if everyone, starting with significant concessions from the C-Suite, chipped in a portion of their salary to cut the company's run rate and cover the projected amount that would have been otherwise saved by a layoff?What about you? Do you believe in our "musical chairs" culture, or would you be willing to make a personal sacrifice to support the team you work with every day?Please share your willingness in the Poll, and share with your colleagues so that we can get a significant sample on what I hope is an important question for many in the workforce.#recession2022 #team #layoffs #culture #workculture #downsizing #twitter #techlayoffs #badbosses #jobloss #careers #jobsearchadvice #jobsearch #corporateculture #csuite #paycheck #hrcommunity #peopleoperations #peoplefirst #humanresources (https://lnkd.in/gRjpeMpP)

With a looming recession, you might be worried about your freelancing career. But don't worry research shows that a freelancing career booms during a recession. I am giving you 4 points to prove the same:- 1. Companies hire freelancers more during a recession in order to cut costs. A full-time employee costs more to a company than someone who is hired on a contract basis.2. Recession is a huge opportunity for freelancers to grow their side business and turn it into a full-time job.3. If you are somebody who is working a full-time job and side hustling, your side hustle can provide you with additional bucks. Also if the threat of layoff is looming over you then you are blessed to have a side job that pays.4. On any given day a freelancer possesses more skills than an average full-time employee of an organization. This is because a freelancer works on multiple projects at the same time which requires different skills. When the economy is stable, it‚Äôs easy to feel secure about your income and your lifestyle. When the economy starts to wobble many people lose their illusion of stability. One of the best ways to restore a sense of control and confidence is by pursuing freelance work. There is so much to be gained from independent work that goes beyond extra income. #recession2022 #recession

Marketers must apply proper research into their advertising and marketing plans to tide over the tough times. Furthermore, a Harvard Business review paper of 2009 on marketing during the recession said that when survival is at stake, it is easier to get companywide buy-in for revising marketing strategies and reallocating investments.

Millennials And Demand: What Investors And Multifamily Leaders Need To Know"The U.S. now finds itself with a huge swell of housing demand and¬†not enough supply, and part of this demand is due to the millennial generation. As they begin to form families and move up in their careers, this large slice of the population is facing high housing prices and rising interest rates.¬†Home prices in the U.S. increased by 18.3% between May 2021 and May 2022, according to the¬†Federal Housing Finance Agency‚Äôs House Price Index, caused by a lack of supply and¬†fierce competition. Home buyers must also contend with rising mortgage rates, which is the result of the Fed‚Äôs attempt to cool inflation by¬†raising interest rates."

Spend wisely in the next 1-2 Year... High alert of Recession ...#meta #socialemediamarketing #layoffs #recession2022
-----------------------------
#RizngProYou're hearing the phrase often "Inflation is rising". The most current data from the research tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy show that India's unemployment rate declined to 6.43% in September 2022, the lowest level since August 2018, and after reaching a one-year high of 8.3% in August 2022. In the US, the Federal Reserve's monetary policies may be a factor in whether a recession will occur. With the looming threat of a recession, are people ready for what's to come?Chakri Lokapriya¬†opines that there is no such thing as medium-term decoupling in an economy. India is pretty active when it comes to imports and exports. If there is a recession worldwide, oil prices fall down and with strong demand, oil prices go up. He remarks that a recession would increase the fiscal deficit of India. He also brings up the point that there may not be such a thing as a real decoupling of an economy.¬†In this interview, Chakri explores whether this is a real recession or a technical recession, how India reacted with COVID-19 dissipating, whether this was engineered by the US government, whether inflation in India may be an engineered number and more.¬†#recession2022¬†#inflation¬†#rizngpro

How do internal comms teams feel about the doom and gloom of recession? Speaking to pals who work inhouse in internal comms teams, there's mixed views about whether there will be budget cuts to IC like there have been in previous recessions. Some say that since the pandemic, IC is valued more highly and is therefore a necessity that some businesses can't be without. Others disagree and think that their budget will be slashed next year, and their own jobs are at risk. I'd love your thoughts. #work #internalcomms #budget #recession2022 #budgetcuts

It is puzzling to me, especially when the economy is on the downturn, and the available labor force has nearly dissolved, that some are still reluctant to considering a pivot from status quo.  In terms of purchasing goods and services, when the economy slumps, many simply double down on choosing the lowest unit cost vs total cost, especially on the already lower ticket OPEX items, as though doing more of the same will change outcomes.Sure, on the surface, doing what has always been done is certainly "easier", but big picture, the negative impact of maintaining the status quo erodes margins, morale, and customer loyalty.Instead, be open to having a discussion with a vendor different than your own, to see what is happening in the marketplace, and what innovations are available.   You never know what you don't know.Worst case scenario, you learn that you have the best solutions already in place, and you've connected with a "plan b" contact for when things inevitably change.Considering alternatives is better than becoming the next Blockbuster, don't you think?#innovation #statusquo #complacency #tco #lifecycleassessment #lifecycle #roi #esg #economy #thegreatresignation #recession2022

The risk that the Fed will cause a recession remains high, and yesterday's strong equity rally seems to downplay that risk.

The recession is here! and it will only get worse. The housing market crash has started, and the FED is going to make sure that the housing market will crash. One of the biggest problems that many homeowners face is judgments that are attached to their properties. This will cause them to not be able to obtain any kind of financing whether through conventional or private lending. It can be very frustrating and will most often cause a homeowner to go through financial hardship, especially at times like this. My advice would be to contact the person or the entity who owns the judgment against your property and to find out the details and any possible settlement scenario. #recession2022 #marketcrash #preforeclosure #Forclosure #Judgments #housingmarket

There‚Äôs adjustable rate (ARM) options you can qualify for which offers a lower fixed interest rate for the first few years (I‚Äôm talking 5, 7, 10 years) then adjusts afterwards!

Small and medium sized trucking companies may be in for a bumpy ride as a freight recession looms over the industry. Freight experts have seen a slower pace of freight haulage as retailers and business cut back operations during a traditionally peak holiday season for trucking companies. Transportation professionals who have experienced prior recessions in the industry including 2008 and 2019, share some advice on how small and mid-sized trucking companies can survive another recession:- Take care of your drivers and other assets; by continuing to employ drivers and retaining those in your fleet, companies can come out of recessions full steam ahead to support shipping programs- Average 3,000 miles a week; for long-haul full truck load drivers this is the magic number to maintain steady operations. David Owen, founder and president of the¬†National Association of Small Trucking Companies¬†(NASTC) says 3,00 miles every week for 48 weeks of the year & getting drivers home for the weekend is a winning recipe- Control fuel and other operating costs; trucking companies should secure discounts on fuel wherever available, and consider implementing new technologies to automate load sourcing, pricing, invoicing and manual work tasks #transportation #truckingindustry #trucking #recession2022 #recession #brokerage #freightbroker #freightforwarding #truckdrivers #3pl #logistics

debet crises and what you have to Know.

Sadly, my timeline today is filled with posts of people who have been laid off this week (Twitter, Meta, Redfin, OpenDoor, HP, etc.). The Federal Reserve, in it's fight against inflation, has blatantly stated that the employment rate in the US must DECREASE. By making access to funds more expensive, businesses budgets will feel the squeeze. This will force significant layoffs. In turn, more people will be unable to spend, helping to decrease demand and thus, slow the economy and inflation. This article was from August, we knew it was coming, but it doesn't at all take the sting out of it. Is there something wrong with the design when a system fails if a great majority of its people are employed, well paid, and able to afford a comfortable lifestyle? What about the disconnect from the fact that in the face of the increasing inflation, there has still been a large population of people out of work? We've been hearing claims that there are 2 to 3 job openings for every person seeking employment. But, those of us who have been looking for jobs have been experiencing a different reality. There a many job postings, true, but few seem to be true openings that companies have any real intentions to fill. Are there no other, more humane solutions to increasing inflation?As someone that has been seeking employment for a year now, my heart goes out to those who have joined me in the search this week. I am blessed that it has been a choice to return to the workforce for us.  My family is accostumed to living on one income. But I know that the majority of the people that lost their jobs this week are not in that same position. I hope that you know that to us, you are more than a line item on a budget that needs to be cut, you are humans and we see you. ‚ù§ #work #people #jobs #economy #employment #jobpostings #jobopenings #layoffs #inflation #recession2022 #twitter #meta #hp #redfin #opendoor

#recession Business leaders in #europe and the #unitedstatesofamerica are speaking openly now about the reality of a recession over the next 12-18 months.#ceo 's are practically unanimous in planning and preparation (98% in The U.S.A and 99% in Europe) as they detail out future expectations during earnings calls, employee updates, industry surveys, etc. according to David Gura at NPR.  While the duration of the recession is expected to be brief at 6-9 months according to experts such as David Rubenstein of The Carlyle Group, many companies have already made tough decisions about #layoffs, future #hiring,  #capitalinvestment ,  #cashflow , and more.  Here are other considerations:üö© Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that consumer prices are up, unemployment is up in October 2022, and employer payrolls are expected to be down also (https://www.bls.gov/ ).  üö© Job cuts are all over the news and in our #linkedin feeds every day (https://lnkd.in/gztZjg75 ).  üö© Fortune reports that grocery staples are up 24% on average for 8 staple items that most families need (https://lnkd.in/gxPsJssy ).  üö© #diesel fuel shortage being warned by some experts will only add stress to an already strained supply chain for many (https://lnkd.in/g69p6akM). üö© While the date has been pushed back to December 4th, there still looms the possibility of a #railroad strike (https://lnkd.in/g_stfHFG ).üö© #gasprices starting to climb again (https://lnkd.in/gVf7KXiB).

My Monday Macro View: Confusion & Contradictions - RecessionThe following was an interesting article and provided a different, optimistic point of view. However, without going into facts, figures and indexes, following are some of the questions and thoughts, I ask myself to get an answer to - will there be a global recession? 1) Most of today's debt and increase in M2 supply was made at ultra low or negative interest rates.2) With a global monetary tightening in place, can the actors who absorbed this money supply pay it back? 3) Post Covid-19 there was an unprecedented increase in debt mostly in developing countries - with dollar Index near 20 years high and Fed's continued rate hikes, debt servicing for this debt is eating away at forex of many of these countries. Does this not involve systemic risk? 4) Indexes and figures are falling from their recent peaks. But they all still remain well above their averages. Food prices index has fallen, wheat, corn and rice too. But in many countries, they are still at least 100 percent more expensive than a year ago. 5) Energy bills continue to go up. I paid my last electricity bill which was more than double compared to last month. This will continue to put downward pressure on living standards across the world. 6) BUT is it possible that the elevated state of prices, rising interest rates, might have made us/policy makers cautious? Minsky Moment identified... Therefore nullified? It isn't easy to predict. It is almost impossible to predict economy. But we can mostly see the overall trajectory. I think we are heading for a massive correction in overall asset valuations... If not a recession.
