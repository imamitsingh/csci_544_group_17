Some of us tend to think about #racism, #antisemitism, and #intolerance as ugly relics from history books. But from time to time, we get nasty reminders, like the recent remarks from Kanye West and Kyrie Irving. Luckily, as Rabbi Nachman said, "if you believe something can be broken, believe it can also be fixed". I choose to believe that we can fix this, and I am gratefully that Eddy Curry, the former NBA player, who played on the Chicago Bulls, the New York Knicks, Inc. and Miami HEAT, chooses to believe too. Thank you, Eddy, for joining Project Max and speaking out against racism, antisemitism, and intolerance!  If you read this far, would you please consider sharing this post and making your own voice heard against racism, antisemitism, and intolerance? Thank you!Amir Gissin Eric Rubin Tamir Goodman Shay Doron Arik Zeevi Asher Polani Roni Reshef Hillel Schuster Yarden Vatikay Lee Igel Kerry Leigh Miller

It’s been a week since we were warned about the OpenSSL vulnerability. Since then, Sonatype has concluded a deep dive into the vulnerability, and we are sharing the need-to-know details of what we found.  💻💡 In this resource, Eddie Knight, Software and Cloud Engineer on Sonatype's Developer Relations team, has put together a piece explaining what CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602 are...and are not.

"Share with my thoughts" (LinkedIn suggestion). Hmmmm 🤔 Are you going to shadow ban me LinkedIn?? Nevertheless...Here they are: 1. I put my hands on a lot of people.2. I know cops that put their hands on a lot more people than I ever did.3. I do NOT know of any cop that ever put their hands on anyone because of their race.4. I know every time I ever put hands on someone, the subject was threatening to me or another person.5. I know the same (#4) for the more "active" cops.6. I know black or brown (hate those terms) cops that performed in the same manner.  7. I know if the subject resists, argues or fights, the subject is escalating the situation, not me. 8. I know I never wanted to be hurt or hurt anyone...But I would hurt the subject if necessary.9. I know most cops feel the same. 10. I know that if the subject is an a**hole, the cops can't fix what his/her family could not solve in a lifetime. Maybe generations.

Why must we address #racism & #classism to safeguard #animalwelfare? Housing problems are a top reason pets are relinquished to animal shelters. Some notes from article below: -- “Low-income communities & communities of color pay disproportionately higher fees to keep pets in their homes than higher income & predominantly white communities. -- In her 2018 report, “The Black Man’s Dog,” Harvard Law School Legislative Policy Fellow Ann Linder concluded that breed restrictions like a ban on pit bulls were “a new form of redlining to keep minorities out of majority-white neighborhoods.”-- While tenants [with pets] pay an average of $864 in deposits and $600 a year in extra rent, “the average dollar amount of extra damages caused by pets is $210 and many residents choose to pay for these damages out of their own pockets.”-- Landlords can and do weaponize the pets of low-income tenants….“A tenant complains about a leak or infestation, and the next thing they know, an animal control officer is knocking at the door. The landlord has called to report them as abusers.”-- Pet restrictions [and pet fees]... are one reason “attempts to rehouse pet owners experiencing homelessness are consistently unsuccessful.”

Growing up, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in high performance organized sports. Being a high performance athlete requires immense discipline. Imagine this compounded with racism. Racialized athletes have to work twice as hard,  since they are navigating spaces that historically and currently have not fostered a culture of belonging and anti-racism.The Government of Nova Scotia in partnership with the Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey, Canadian Sport Institute Atlantic, Recreation NS, Recreation Facility Association NS, and Sport NS launched its inaugural  #antiracism in sport and recreation week.

I've been posting about this theme for a while, and this pictured statement accompanied by Amira's statement....💯. To the point. They want you but they don't want all of you - the all of you that adds value to these spaces (your critical analysis, equity focus, interconnected identities, your depth) - they just care about the public facing narrative they are trying to create, send out, and desperately trying to believe/convince themselves of...despite voices telling them otherwise.If I have ever been passionate about being somewhere and you no longer see me there, it is highly likely that the space was toxic, harmful, unsafe, inequitable, and soul draining for me.

This weekend:-The editor of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) said this👉🏽 “The GMC has become an adversarial organisation, where lawyers and bureaucrats are pitted against doctors, where success is seen in conviction rates rather than better outcomes for patients, and where *discrimination* is so *institutionalised* that it is almost impossible to acknowledge. All this is delivered without compassion and with little common sense.”Professor Everington & Professor Esmail said this👉🏽 "If the GMC was subject to public scrutiny in the same way that the Care Quality Commission assesses healthcare organisations and general practices, it would be rated as inadequate and subject to special measures,"I agree but they missed out the words *RACIAL* & *RACIST*#Racism is the *burning* thread that runs through the complaints, disciplinary and referral pathway for doctors in the NHS from 🎬 to 🔚Black, Asian and minority ethnic doctors are 3x more likely to be referred to the General Medical Council (GMC) compared to our white counterparts. The majority of the cases are dismissed. Referrals to the GMC cause morbidity and mortality. All we ask for is *parity*Today, was the 4th Saturday that we stood in solidarity with Dr Valentine Udoye.

At the time of the first and second World War, the British needed all the help they could get. Sikhs were told of a war in another part of the world where there was suffering and injustice.Tens of thousands signed up and fought on the front lines. The British needed the best of the best and the bravest soldiers to get the job done. What happened to race discrimination when help was needed? Leaders weren't looking at the colour of skin. But, ability, skill and a heart to complete a mutual goal. Racism sits in the mind. How you view reality simply depends on the story you tell yourself. Where does your story come from? It's automatic.Can you believe all of your thoughts?Think about it. How many of your worries, actually ever came true? If we can learn anything from the wars (apart from not to have them), let's bring awareness that these soldiers fought together in the war with a common goal of humanity and justice. Respect to all of those soldiers, regardless of skin colour or gender who fought with the intention to bring peace and harmony and eradicate injustice.  #respect #mind #racism #remembranceday #sikhsinFrance #femalesoldiers #leadership #gender

Why do Westerners tolerate their countries being called racist? Why is it only the West that flagellates itself over its colonial past and over slavery, when all other parts of the world had slaves and engaged in colonisation? And why does the West tolerate climate policies that threaten to impoverish its citizens, while knowing full well that this will have no bearing on global carbon emissions? In this piece, I argue that the Western mindset remains Christian, even though Western individuals and governments have turned secular. I attribute wokeness to a subconscious longing for Christian ideas, such as the Holy Victim, Original Sin, Penance and Judgement.Do please read it and let me know what you think. #diversityandinclusion #christianity #christianliving #blackexcellence #racism

SLAVERY IS STILL POPULAR IN FIVE AMERICAN STATES AND LEGAL IN ONE, BUT WE'RE NOT A RACIST NATION, RIGHT? Difficult as it is to believe, in the year 2022 five states in the United States of America were asked to decide whether to keep the forced slavery of human beings on the books as law, or to prohibit that hellish practice. In one state, Louisiana, voters actually chose to leave slavery legal. That's right, the good folks of Louisiana have pretty much rejoined the Confederacy. In the other four states slavery was purged from the books, but despite that: Alabama: 265,606 voters said yes, "let's slap them in chains." Tennessee: 316,973 were all for slavery. Vermont: 14,883 said "you betcha." Oregon: 547,170 fans of human bondage voted to keep slavery on the books.I don't know about you, but regardless of the final results from the midterm elections, the votes from these five states make me sick, and once again leave me to question the future of this nation.#armukrainenow #supportukraine #glorytoukraine #kherson #russia #warcrimes #putin #slavery #racism

A good read for white women is "White Women" by the same women behind the documentary - Regina Jackson and Saira Rao.Book: "It's no secret that white women are conditioned to be "nice," but did you know that the desire to be perfect and to avoid conflict at all costs are characteristics of white supremacy culture? They deconstruct and analyze nine aspects of traditional white woman behavior--from tone-policing to weaponizing tears--that uphold white supremacy society, and hurt all of us who are trying to live a freer, more equitable life." Previously, left a space, along with multiple black persons, due to a white woman, and previously a white man supported by this white woman (before she stepped into this leadership position after the previous white man left - which the white man stepped into... a position that was wrongfully taken from a black man via outcomes of racism, insitutional biases rooted in whiteness, etc). The space is rooted in whiteness and institutional and systemic racism. We wanted to hold on, but holding on had negative health and wellness implications. This white woman, and space, was told by multiple people that it is racist, in addition to examples of how she and the space impacted non white, predominantly black people, via tone policing, gaslighting etc... and due to her privilege has never taken accountability, apologized, nor stepped down from the position she holds - and continues to be protected and cushioned by the people in this space. 🤷🏾‍♀️ #whiteprivilege #culture #societyandculture #society #equity #racism #diversity #books #documentary #belonging #workplaceculture #wellness #leadership #experience #people #health

IT'S OK TO CALL ME GWEILO - But maybe not always. A few months ago I was at dinner with a good friend who is Singaporean. We were in the company of two other Singaporeans whose command of English was not great. A lot of the conversation was in their Chinese dialect. The meal was delicious but probably not the sort of thing a lot of 'Western' people would eat. One of the dishes was fishheads. And yes, I partook. I even ate the eyeball (apologies to those with more sensitive tastes). I grew up in regional Germany where most of the animal killed was eaten and as such, if it is on the plate and deemed edible, it gets eaten.This attracted much admiration from my co-diners and the host. Many a favourable sentiment was uttered about my culinary open mindedness but in the conversation the word Gweilo was frequently used. I am sure those who uttered the term thought little of it. I was not bothered in the elast. Universally, the sentiment was that one of pleasant surprise that I as a 'foreigner' not only ate but enjoyed the 'local' Chinese cuisine (the dinner was here in Perth).All was friendly and I certainly took no offence.However, as the case report below illustrates how, in a different context the same use of a word can cause offence to an individual. The qualitative difference here goes to the diminution and invalidation of a person. In my situation, there was no invalidation. Despite the use of the term, the context was not aggressive.Words have the power to harm. In that context, a word must not be used.Indeed, calling someone a German may be defamatory (Slazengers Ltd v Gibbs (1916) 33 TLR 35).As the world grapples with identity, culture, nationhood and globalization, it seems challenging to deprive anyone of their linguistic habits but we should not lose sight that there are lines that should not and must be crossed. These lines do not exclusively exist in 'Western' societies. In the meantime, my friends can readily call me Gweilo.#societyandculture #power #globalization #culture #people #language #defamation #racism #culturalsensitivity #culinary

Hi,Please read this and at least hit a like and share.I have not posted much on LinkedIn until today, but I should raise a voice against corporate racism at Dabur India Limited work culture. One of my friends recently joined the Dabur India Limited Head office at the Ghaziabad U.P. location. The work culture is pathetic, and the superior can say anything to you. Recently my friend was showing his presentation to his Boss; my friend was justifying his campaign, but his Boss yelled & said, "ye Bihari soch; chhapra ki soch yahan mat lgao. Don't put your Bihari thinking Chhapra type thinking here". It's simply like someone is doing racism because he wants to put himself right. Ideation and creative differences can be understandable, but how come someone comments on your Identity, ancestors, and belongingness? Being a proud "Bihari", I can not tolerate this #racism at all. I request Dabur India Limited to check on his Senior Employee's behaviour toward junior Employees. Last but not least, If you are planning to join Dabur India Limited. Just leave the thought here only. I will keep posting this until Dabur India Limited takes action against that Senior employee.  #like #share #linkedin #india #Bihar #Proud #Racism #dabur #daburindia

𝗪𝗵𝘆?The solution often offered by the Europeans (known as the Western world) is to always project themselves as the savior. And they are not! Actually we saved  them multiple times and still do so to this day...African, South-American & Asian countries do not need help from Europe. Europe needs to give back what they stole from them and leave their resources and people alone! What Europe sees as help, is to portait themselves as the "Savior". They have this arrogancy to come in mess up the way of life (culture), disrupting human nature, dividing them in persons so they can box them into personalities and characterize them into "#diversities", so they'll get lost and are not able to find "#inclusion" anymore, as they lost their "sense of cultural belonging". As they than lost touch with their humanness and merely become symbols imposed by European standards and the way Europeans view the world. They are the ones who are totally depending on the poverty and independance of countries who have the resources to actually uplift themselves from their position they were forced to accept by Europeans through #imperialism,  #colonialism, #slavery and #racism, #education, #laws #capitalism and have them belief (#braindirted) they need help...Europe you can start helping the world by looking after yourself, fixing their own CONtinent and leave the GODtinents at peace.Those GODtinents were here long before Europe and did perfectly fine, by themself, untill Europe came to impose their ways, ruining them by dividing them. And now you want to help these countries, by giving them back a small piece of what Europe has stolen from them. There is no need for that kind of help. Just give back what you stole, robbed, destroyed, falsified and ruined, and we will be well on our way. And maybe we can come and help you, cause you'll be bankrupt and have no resources to turn to. To me that sounds like a plan. You good with that?STOP acting like you what humanity is, since we gave you the ability to become humans. If it wasn't for the melanated people, ⚪ people would be either wiped out or still living in caves. Period.*I said what I said & I can back it up too!If you are a ⚪ person, don't take it personal, you are a victim of those who implemented this system of capitalism as well, however we do need you to own up & take responsibity.

Greatrising to you,I wanted to share my early rising experience with you, about #awareness!I walked in this store to buy a croissant, as I'll be watching my son play soccer.A woman walked in front of me and there were a few employees unpacking things. One of the girls cheerfully greets the  woman. I was walking behind the lady, about 1,5 meters. The employee than saw me, paused while see looked at me... than said goodmorning to me also as I walked pass her. As I am used to racism, and have come accostum to it that I 99% of the time will not be greeted as well, I said hi and than paused.I turned around and said to her, you had to think about that, didn't you? She was a bit embarressed and said, uhmmm... yes.She than followed up, I am becoming more and more aware that fact that I'm doing this. I looked at her, and said: thankh you for your honesty. I understand completely. But this is all we ask of you. That you simple become aware.A load fall of her shoulders 😊.I want to hereby compliment all #people, who are doing their best, to want to change. I know it takes a lot 🤎I for one can not blame you, allthough it might come across like this sometimes. But mind you, we won't be able to cross this bridge, untill we build it first. A bridge build on the fundamentals of humanness, safety, trust and honesty.

I picked up a copy of “Anti-Racist Leadership: How to Transform Corporate Culture in a Race-Conscious World” by James D. White recently and I’m on my second read through it already.I started putting sticky notes on the edges of pages I wanted to go back to and I now I’m starting to run out of sticky notes!I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to #learn, #change, #grow, and #lead.   It is informative, thought provoking, and practical.

KEY QUOTE: "We, as a nation, recognize the necessity of having #ArmedForces to ensure the safety and security of the #homefront and the larger world, but we should always hope these forces face #battle only as a last resort. Our history tells of particular tragedy — in places like #Vietnam and #Iraq — when we entered into conflict we should have avoided. The #service and #sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is not limited to #ActiveWarfare. It can be found in the myriad manifestations of duty required by those who have taken the #OathToServe. It can be found in long #deployments and missed time with loved ones. It can be found in physical and emotional exertion. And it can be found in the strain of always preparing for the possibility of #war. Our military also has been a driver of social change. It desegregated before the country did. And it has offered a path of opportunity for many who desperately needed it, including those from #immigrant and #marginalized groups. But like the society it reflects, the #American #military is not immune from the divisions seen in the nation at large. Our political and military leaders must be diligent in rooting out #racism, #sexism, #bigotry, #homophobia, and the #extremism that has been on the rise in recent years. We have seen evidence that the #MAGA mindset has taken root to some degree in our military and among some of those who served. Many who stormed the #Capitol on #January6 were veterans. And the ranks of groups like the #ProudBoys are reportedly full of veterans as well. These people embody the antithesis of those who wore the uniform before them. Our brave veterans defeated the N*zis and the forces of #ViolentAutocracy more generally. They protected us from the #SovietUnion. They stood guard against a world that despised our diversity and our freedoms. This is the legacy we honor today. Our veterans have been the authors of many of the key inflection points in our nation’s history. They have ushered us from danger to hope, from strife to peace, and from division to unity. As we struggle to find our footing in an era of disorientation and peril, let us express our gratitude to those whose steadfastness and courage allow us to continue on our journey toward a more perfect union. To all of you who have served, we thank you. Steady."KEY TAKEAWAY: #DanRather takes the opportunity to distinguish between those #veterans who served in, for example, #Iraq, #Afghanistan, #Vietnam, #Korea or #WW2, and those who now find themselves seduced by the #MAGA #cult. One group we celebrate without reservation; the other we must treat with a degree of caution....#society #opportunity #thankyou #security #mindset #safety #leaders #diversity #gratitude Steven Streitfeld Paul Shoffner Paul Cobaugh Harold Lawson Robert Reich Richard Rosenthal Sharon Lawrence Rick van Leuven Kenneth Lagasse Marc Friedman Marc Foreman

Interesting article, but I disagree of the proposed actions to escaping the double bind. A firm that fosters and condones a culture of bullying, intimidation, and harassment will go to great extents to block individuals that are highly capable of being extraordinary leaders.Of my 25+ years of work experience there is a lot to be said about systematic biases within organizations. Contrary to #DEI initiatives, underrepresented minorities are NOT welcome in senior leadership roles. Consistent barriers, arduous processes, clear racism established to keep minorities in their place. The fake positive narratives, leaders are gaslighting, white washing the ongoing pattern of discrimination. It’s not us, it’s you trope.Mandatory training campaigns are clear messages there is something wrong, reported even, within the firm’s culture and leadership. DEI, sexual & workplace harassment, integrity, etc training does not resolve patriarchal behaviours that exist in racist cultures. Allies are required to take action. Ask questions. Report issues immediately. Bystanders stop accepting and continuing to perpetuate these workplace behaviours. Leaders with power use your power to more than influence, but insist on change. Workforce dynamics will significantly change with new perspectives.

Over racisme en discriminatie gesproken. Ditmaal is China de klos... maar dat valt minder op, want de keywords Zw.art en W.it zijn niet gebruikt. #wokeIn onderstaande video heeft Don Ceder (Christen Unie) het over kinderen op social media. Specifiek wordt benoemd "niet alleen #Tiktok, maar ook Instagram, beetje #afzwakken..." vervolgd door nu weten we ook dat #China een land is dat erom bekend staat die gegevens (in het kort gezegd) misbruiken. Dit laatste #bekrachtigd natuurlijk Tiktok, want is van Chinees fabrikaat. Waarom Tiktok die vele malen korter bestaat als een Facebook en Instagram die al jaren onze gegevens misbruiken, AI discriminatie faciliteren en niet aanpakken, continu meeluisteren, ookal heb je de app niet openstaan... wat expliciet wil zeggen dat waarvan het Westen Huawei betichtigd, zelf doet,...Het zal vast komen door de "doctrine of discovery" (die overigens nog steeds van kracht is en gehandhaafd wordt door de VN), ooit door de Christenen bedacht, dat die normen en waarden zo diep versleuteld liggen.Het Westen (ook zij die de Westerse waarden en normen zich eigen hebben gemaakt, wit & zwart) denkt het alleenrecht te hebben, te kunnen en te mogen oordelen over anderen hun handelen. De slager die zijn eigen vlees keurt, is een Nederlands gezegde die dit mooi illustreert.Racisme en discriminatie zijn geen wit privilege, we doen het allemaal... kleine hint: het heeft vrij weinig te maken met ras,... but ya'll ain't ready for that conversation yet.En iedereen het maar liken. Ging dit om een Afrikaans land, dan was nu iedereen eroverheen gevallen dat het discriminatie was... blijf het zeggen: #woke is een illusie.Er is geen echt besef, maar dat komt doordat de kern en hun volgers doordrengt zijn van normen en waarden die je ontmenselijken en kapitiseren (bij gebrek aan een beter woord).Je doet automatisch mee aan een kapitalistisch systeem en dat is wat alles in stand houdt, onze #levensstijl#knewknowledge #humanhistory #ourstory #frombelievingtoknowing #facts #love #instagram #Tiktok #facebook #linkedin #racism #discriminatie #diversiteit #inclusie # #ai #socialmedia #video #woke #zwart #wit #arabisch #aziatisch #Joods #alleswatandersis #allesbuitendenorm

I don't normally do this, and I feel very vulnerable talking about this on such a public platform but its necessary at this point. There comes a point where you have to say enough is enough and not suffer in silence. I've encountered racism multiple times in high school, university and never spoke up about it. It's passive aggression, microaggression and often masked in a way which can't be detected and often leaves an individual questioning their own sanity. This wouldn't be the same for white co-workers. This is the case of Adrian Brown who exhibits this exact pattern of behaviour. Real example : white co-worker sleeps on job and is not spoken to. I close my eyes after applying eyedrops for 2-5 minutes and I'm reported for sleeping and spoken to the following day, white co-worker is only spoken to after I point out how unfair this treatment is - it had been roughly two weeks since this white co-worker had slept on the job.To speak openly, the system in which we operate allows particularly white men to scrutinise in anyway, be incompetent and still rise through ranks and be the law unto themselves in and outside the workplace. I as a black man am tired of being scrutinised and held to such standards no one else is held to. I deserve to have places that are safe and that I can grow professionally and not to be discarded. I deserve the same grace and learning opportunities as my white counterparts.I am turning to my professional networks for support and advice, how do we change the system? How do you all handle working in racist environments day in and day out? Because I am truly tired.#racism #culturalsafety #workplace #microagression #concreteceiling

On this #VeteransDay lets reflect on the powerful #diversity of those who serve in defense of our nation and values. Let's continue to work towards celebrating the wonderful spectrum of difference that unite us. In addition, lets remember that we owe ALL those who serve, not just our gratitude, but our commitment to their wellness and prosperity upon return from their ultimate sacrifices. They deserve to return to safety, respect and opportunity. Sadly many return to be on their own in tough issues of mental wellness, violence against #women, #racism, and immigration among others. Below is some great insight into the growing diversity of our #military, and here is another link to an example of some ways we often fail veterans: https://lnkd.in/gmmRGE7TThank you to our veterans for all that you endure at home and abroad.

There has been much noise made recently about the urgent need for police reform in the UK, especially in regards to vetting of applicants and serving officers alike, and, the need for an effective internal discipline system. (I argue that hiring the right people into a healthy organizational culture pretty much negates the need to have a robust discipline system.)This piece from the Times today certainly makes the case for both measures. To the 'coppers' who can't keep their hands to themselves, their miniscule penises in their pants, and their mouths shut- you're no better than the criminals we're supposed to be protecting society against. In fact, you're far worse, because you took an oath to be one of the good guys. Oh, and by the way- thanks for handing our detractors in the #abolition and #defund movements even more ammunition to use against the vast majority of us who aren't bent. Assholes. #Gwent #police #heddlu #Wales #policereform #policemisconduct #corruption #misogyny #racismKelly Donovan Kim Prodaniuk Angelina Rivers

Comedian Trevor Noah’s thought provoking take on British racism: Comedian #TrevorNoah has responded hilariously to #British #racists who have taken offence to Rishi Sunak, non-white and of Indian origin, becoming the prime minister of the #UnitedKingdom.Host of The Daily Show, Noah said #RishiSunak, who is just 42, will probably "serve well into his 42-and-a-halves". "Let's not forget another important first. he is also the first prime minister who is an absolute snack," Noah said.The comedian mentioned that not everyone in the #UK is happy about Sunak becoming the #primeminister. He played a clip from a British radio show in which a caller explained why a non-white person becoming the #PM of the UK is not a good thing."Can you imagine me becoming Prime Minister of Pakistan?

If there is one thing that makes me feel sick it's the level of racism in some countries. 🤢 Huge thumbs up 👍🏻 and applaus 👏🏻for the entire Adriatic region!  From the moment I moved to Croatia 🇭🇷 I've seen how people in this region are. From my own experience, I would describe the locals as:👉🏻 Warm hearted 👉🏻 Hospitable 👉🏻 Generous That's why it is very encouraging to see this image below - with Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia all scoring very well on the level of racism. 👏🏻🙌🏻 I am positive that this low level of racism is part reason why Croatia is currently the most loved country in the world among remote work professionals - aka digital nomads. ❤️🥰We might not be among the richest countries of Europe, but we definitely belong among the most decent & welcoming countries in the world - showing great respect to all humans in a world full of colorful people! 👍🏻Cheers, 🥂Jan de Jong President Digital Nomad Association Croatia #Croatia#Racism#DigitalNomads#LivingTheCroatianDream

MDs. Can’t live with them. Can’t live without them🤷🏻‍♀️Toen ik in 2015 de deur van de medische faculteit achter me dicht trok, vond ik dat ik heel erg goed zonder hen zou kunnen leven. Alleen: ze blijven toch wel érg aanwezig in mijn leven, die artsen. Via Antwerp Management School en hun leiderschaps- en andere trajecten voor de zorg waarin ik doceer, via Raden van Bestuur waarin ik mag zetelen, zelfs op vakantie (toen ik exact een jaar geleden in Zanzibar een kniepees scheurde en veel tijd op een strandbed doorbracht -zie foto- op advies van een erg aardige Egyptische arts). En ik beland nog steeds met regelmaat in de handen van een arts, klunsje dat ik al eens ben. Ik coach artsen. Ik heb artsen in mijn vrienden- en kennissenkring. Ze hebben allemaal de opleiding geneeskunde moeten doorlopen. En dan vind ik soms wel sneu voor ze…In 1997 verscheen 'Making Doctors' (Simon Sinclair MD). Het boek beschrijft hoe studenten arts worden maar heeft het ook over machtsstructuren met effecten op gender & race binnen de artsopleiding die moeten herbekeken worden. Psychische problemen bij studenten in de medische opleiding komen vaak voor en worden weinig/niet (h)erkend; en hun docenten zijn overwegend zelf arts.Een systematic review uit 2016, bijna 20 jaar later (Prevalence of Depression, Depressive Symptoms, and Suicidal Ideation Among Medical Students door Rotenstein et al), leert dat 27,2% van de medische studenten last heeft van depressie of depressieve klachten. 11,1% van de medische studenten denkt aan zelfmoord. En nog steeds zijn de meeste docenten zelf arts.In 2020 schreef Kmiekowizc in een speciale editie van de British Medical Journal dat ook racisme nog steeds een probleem is in heel wat medische faculteiten in de UK. Hoewel 40% van de studenten uit ethnic minorities afkomstig is, volgens het artikel dat stelt dat "some universities are still oblivious to the issue of racism'. Er zijn dus nog wel wat issues. Het is niet altijd makkelijk, voor artsen én zeker niet voor studenten. Dus ik benader ze graag vanuit mijn hart. Ze verdienen het (meestal toch).Gisteren ging ik aan de slag met een clubje artsen, en enkele niet-artsen. Het ging over samenwerken in veiligheid en over meningsverschillen en hoe we niet zomaar alles kunnen aanvaarden. Een arts-diensthoofd vertelde voor de groep hoe hij steeds korte metten maakt met racisme en racistische opmerkingen. Hij zei: 'dit kan gewoon niet. Ik wil dit gewoon niet. Ik leid studenten en assistenten op. Ik duld geen racisme op onze dienst.' Mja. Can’t live without them, dus. Zeker niet als ze zo geweldig zijn als mijn favoriete artsen van de week: Dr. Evert Hamans, MD PhD (en niet alleen omdat hij aardige dingen over mij zegt op Linkedin 😉) en Michael De Koning (en niet alleen omdat hij écht grappig is). 🎶voor Evert: alles van de nieuwe van Ólafur Arnalds (Some Kind of Peace- Piano Reworks). Om te spelen wanneer je over het water kijkt. #MD #medicaleducation #racism

DEI 🔥 tip: Please don’t expect that years of inequities can be changed with cheap, quick, or easy solutions. White leaders, our tendency to rationalize—to try to convince ourselves and our colleagues that cheap, quick, or easy solutions are the only ones available to us—is actually our white fragility showing up. If you’re a white leader and you’re working to do better, thank you. What, if anything, is holding you back from more fully living and modeling your DEI values at your organization or institution?#dei #workplace #equity #inclusion #leadership #racism

Hi,Please read this and at least hit a like and share.I have not posted much on LinkedIn until today, but I should raise a voice against Dabur India Limited work culture. One of my friends recently joined #dabur at Ghaziabad U.P. location. The work culture is pathetic, and the superior can say anything to you. Recently my friend was showing his presentation to his Boss; he just looked for mistakes. It can be font colour, ppt Background, Heading size and many more. He was not good in his tone before as well, but recently he called my friend, "Ye jo tumne bnaya hai ye tumhare #Chapra #Bihar me chalta hoga yha nhi chlega." Being a proud "Bihari" I can not tolerate this #racism at all. I request Dabur to check on his Senior Employee's behaviour toward junior Employees. Last but not least, If you are planning to join #Dabur. Just leave the thought here only. I will keep posting this until Dabur India Limited takes action against that Senior employee.    #like #share #linkedin #india #Bihar #Proud #Racism

Two years ago the CEO of UPS, Carol B. Tomé made a public vow to use the company's resources to eradicate racial injustice. Three months later, Black UPS driver Ray Logan was told to deliver in neighborhoods with Confederate flags where residents he delivered to used racial epithets and threatened his life. He asked to change routes, and shortly thereafter was fired after 33 years with the company.Inside the company, too, he experienced horrific racism:"When I ran into my colleague and asked her why she asked not to work with me, she started crying. I pressed to know the reason—after all, I’d thought of her as a friend—and she said it was because I am Black. I later found out her boyfriend had called the UPS center manager and told him not to let her work with me anymore for that very reason. The manager complied with his request."The EEOC reviewed his case and issued a right to sue letter - his union steward resigned in protest over his treatment. Incredibly, UPS offered him just $5,000 to settle his lawsuit--an insulting sum, given he lost his livelihood, part of his pension, and his health insurance after 33 years with the company.We ask you share Ray's story and tag UPS. He asks simply, given UPS's public statements to eradicate racism: What will UPS do to address racism in its own backyard?#UPS #racism #BLM #lioness #lionesstoryhttps://lnkd.in/eNTQZ9E2

Often the most important events are not discussed or even seen.In the Netherlands there was recently a court case which changed how wage discrimination will be dealt with in the Netherlands and as such the EU.Mirjam Admiraal worked as a legal aid for Wehkamp, a major online retailer. She found out she was paid a substantially lower wage than her male and less qualified colleagues.She did not find justice at her place of work and took the matter to court. She won and was compensated for the lost wages and her losing her job.Now there is jurisprudence or case law for cases of wage discrimination. As discrimination can be suffered on basis of different properties this will most likely extend to cases of discrimination on basis of gender, sexuality, religion and race.Extrapolating, I see there is now also a basis to demand transparancy where wages are concerned. This is without a doubt an important step for humanity, justice and equality.Congratulations and thank you for standing up Mirjam Admiraal! 👏🏿 #work #thankyou #law #gender #legal #justiceforall #discrimination #racism #religion #transparancy #wagegap

Four years ago, our research at Pearn Kandola uncovered that the most common response of those who witness racism at work was to take zero action. ⛔As shocking as this revelation was, since then there has been a huge uplift in discussions around race.From the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd, to the spotlight cast upon the Black Lives Matter movement, issues of race equality have gained mass media attention, and public protest. 📰But when it comes to racism at work, has any progress been made?In our latest Racism at Work report, we replicate our 2018 study to determine whether there have been changes in both the perception and experiences of racism at work. Professor Binna Kandola OBE and Research Psychologist Norma Molla review how comfortable both employees and businesses feel discussing race within the workplace. 📈They also measure the efficacy of actions taken by organisations in attempts to combat racist behaviour.To explore their findings in full, click the link below to access the report.

It’s upsetting that Islamophobia is still present and festering in Canada. While in many ways I do feel safer and more accepted to openly practice my religion in Canada over the years, I know in other ways Islamaphobia has gotten worse. And Muslim women who cover their hair (‘hijabi’) are mostly the targets. I just read a post where a hijabi taking the CPA exam in North Vancouver was told to remove her hijab. My wife works and studies in Vancouver. She wears the hijab because it’s her choice. Millions of other women around Canada and the world wear hajab because it’s their choice. It’s an expression of privacy and modesty. When conservative and authoritarian states control people’s freedoms falsely in the name of religion, the problem is the regime not the head covering. What then when governments like France and Quebec aim to limit what a women can an cannot wear? What then when misinformed, Islamophbic Canadian tells a Muslim to take off her hijab or expresses severe hate?This is an uncomfortable issue for some but it’s even more uncomfortable for Muslims who experience forms of Islamophobia and there are few other issues I’m more concerned about. #islamophobia #islam #racism #discrimination #diversityandinclusion #hijab #muslim

It’s now been over a week since the focus of the NBA shifted from an exciting start to the new season to the ugliness of antisemitism, racism and disinformation. I could type extensively about the range of emotions I and many in the Jewish community are feeling, while highlighting the domino effect of hate we are seeing play out in real time due to the disinformation contained in what Kyrie Irving posted, and the lack of education on why these antisemitic tropes starting with Holocaust denial are dangerous as they lead to threats of violence and violence against Jews. There is a litany of historic and factual inaccuracies that are now being quoted, tweeted, shared and doubled down on across social platforms now further dividing the black and jewish communities. Addressing the disinformation is no doubt important but ultimately that is not going to be what leads us forward to a better place.If we can’t recognize this moment as a crucial opportunity to move with purpose towards creating unity between the Black and Jewish communities through open dialogue, historical exploration, the presentation of facts, empathy and realizing we both share the same enemy, White Supremacy, we will never escape this cyclical storm of evil stereotypes, senseless violence, harassment and bigotry. This is not an easy task. There are generations of hatred, decades of distrust and divide to unwind along with a history of traumatic experiences on both sides, though during much different times, that can be utilized to create a baseline of understanding. While there was the unity displayed during the Civil Rights movement to draw from, that is five plus decades removed, and despite the Jewish community presenting itself as an ally in the wake of the George Floyd tragedy in 2020, these moments of meaningful alliance have been few and far between since Rabbi Heschel marched alongside Dr. King. To be beyond clear there is work to be done on both sides, as there has been plenty of blatant racism from parties in the Jewish community for just as long as Jews have experienced antisemitism in the US. This cannot be ignored. Both communities know what it is like to be labeled and branded as “THE OTHER”. Both communities are viewed with hate, disdain and as impure by WHITE SUPREMACISTS.Both communities have the determination, intelligence, creativity, spirit and will to come together and fight back. So why haven’t we? Our common enemy is sitting back laughing at what continues to transpire as a result of this storm of recycled propaganda and hate speech.There is a lot to unpack here, which will need open dialogue, patience, grace, empathy and understanding. Sadly the education on the history of each community has not been taught properly nor thoroughly to either side and we now have generations of people who believe in many of these stereotypes and falsities, which continue to contribute to this divide. (PART 1 of 2)  #antisemitism #racism #community #jewishcommunity

Είμαι χοντρός, άσχημος με γκέι φωνή και αραίωση.Τουλάχιστον αυτό μου είπαν είτε "ευγενικά" είτε με πολύ πιο χυδαίο τρόπο αρκετοί #HRManagers, από αρχές Καλοκαιριού, μέχρι σήμερα. Συχνά ακούω την ατάκα "Η επιχείρηση μας δεν επιθυμεί να ταυτίσει την επωνυμία της με μια προσωπικότητα όπως εσείς", αφού πρώτα έχουν γίνει σχόλια για την εξωτερική μου εμφάνιση. Έστειλα δεκάδες βιογραφικά με την φωτογραφία μου σε εταιρείες που δεν μου απάντησαν ποτέ. Μήνες αργότερα, έστειλα το ίδιο βιογραφικό, χωρίς φωτογραφία, στις ίδιες εταιρείες και με πήρανε για συνέντευξη. Δια ζώσης ή μέσω βιντεοκλήσης και πάλι άκουσα τα ίδια. Έστειλα σε εταιρείες που δουλεύουν συγγενείς, φίλοι και παλιοί συμφοιτητές μου(σε #entrylevel θέσεις). Δεν πήρα απάντηση. Τους έβαλα να ρωτήσουν γιατί δεν με καλέσανε. Μου είπαν πως <<Δεν τους άρεσε η μούρη σου>>.Έκανα συνεντεύξεις σε διάφορες επιχειρήσεις, υπήρξαν #Recruiters που μου είπαν "ωραία τα πτυχία και η προϋπηρεσία σας, αλλά δεν έχετε συγγενή στην επιχείρηση" ή "Η διοίκηση δεν εστιάζει στα πτυχία, αλλά στην εμφάνιση". Με συμβούλεψαν και μου άνοιξαν τα μάτια. Ψεύτικες θέσεις εργασίας, για το φαίνεσθαι, το θεαθήναι, την συλλογή βιογραφικών, την απόκτηση ιδεών μέσω "διαδραστικών συνεντεύξεων και παιχνιδιών".Βλέπω προφίλ ανθρώπων στο #LinkedIn , που είναι σε μεγάλες εταιρείες και χωρίς καμία εκπαίδευση ή προϋπηρεσία, λαμβάνουν τρομερές θέσεις εργασίας. ΟΚ.Το χειρότερο από όλα; ΑΜΙΣΘΕΣ ΘΕΣΕΙΣ "ΕΡΓΑΣΙΑΣ".Η εκμετάλλευση δεν έχει όρια. Εκμεταλλεύονται νέους ανθρώπους με όνειρα, όρεξη για δουλειά και ταλέντο, δεν τους πληρώνουν ποτέ και μέχρι να φύγουν, έχουν βρει το επόμενο θύμα.Enough is enough. Συγχαρητήρια σε όλους στο #LinkedIn που ανεβάζουν για τις νέες θέσεις εργασίας τους, τις ακαδημαϊκές τους επιδόσεις κτλπ, αλλά γιατί δεν μιλάει κανένας για την σαπίλα, την κακή τρέλα και τον #ΡΑΤΣΙΣΜΟ που υπάρχει στην αγορά εργασίας;Υ.Γ.: Την δεδομένη στιγμή, αναζητώ εργασία και είμαι ακόμα χοντρός, άσχημος με γκέι φωνή και αραίωση στα μαλλιά.Αν θες, τσέκαρε το προφίλ μου.#work #job #bullying #mobbing #hr #recruitment #opportunities #greece #racism #career #fat #ugly #bold #gay #rights #equality

I want to share a disturbing experience I had this week in Halifax's startup ecosystem. It may help prevent future occurrences.I asked one of the main speakers at an event where I could get funding for my early-stage startup since hiring a developer costs money.Her response to me, I am Iranian, was to go to an Iranian community and ask the wealthy Iranians to give me money. I was shocked by this response. It was not only a racist and insulting response but also unprofessional from someone who has been in the startup and business ecosystem for many years.After I nicely explained to her that I am here in Canada to benefit from an equal system as a women entrepreneur who had successful businesses before, she still insisted that I could ask Middle Eastern communities for money if I didn't want to go to an Iranian community.Is this the equal, inclusive system everyone talks about at events and conferences?Some Halifax locals are not yet ready for the highly educated, elite newcomers to Canada. They think they can get away with discriminative and racist behaviors.Measures should be taken to train different stakeholders in Halifax organizations to stop subjective behaviors in the startup ecosystem.#startupfunding #halifaxnovascotia #racism

I heard about this incident, and was sickened, appalled and yes… mad. It is a prime example of why every system needs to incorporate an active DEI program. There is so much work to be done to understand the trauma associated with these types of racist assaults, and to minimize them from occurring.The only good thing that comes from this is that the University is now forced to assess their DEI policies, including hiring practices and student support services. #dei #equity #racialsensitivtytraining #trauma #studentsupport #racism

Great share, Horace F. Whittaker, Jr. Ed.D. Thank you for this 💯 Whether it’s #canada or #america, our legal “regulators” (i.e. state bars and law societies) continue to weaponize administrative “complaints” to further the #oppression and silence critics. You can’t make these things up. #racism #discrimination #humanrights #civilrights #justice The silver lining? At least these “complaints” won’t be investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated before the very same people, as is the case north of the border, or otherwise inordinately delayed without recourse. “Litigating civil rights for black people and for brown people in a majority white culture is like climbing up a hundred-foot cliff with a hundred-pound boulder on your back.”“Nevertheless, the FL Bar seeks to sanction/discipline the Girleys for speaking about their observation and experiences as civil rights attorneys. The Bar has labeled these comments as essentially untruthful, a violation of the oath of office, and possibly “prejudicial” to the judicial system.”

After an incredible private screening of #theblackpanther which saw almost 100 of our #Qld #Africanaustralian community and friends together centering #African cultures and celebration of all who we are..and now waking up to this👇🏿 https://lnkd.in/g76EuKwJ@QueenslandPoliceService  I am disgusted beyond measure.To continue to see and hear this racist vitriol coming out of those who suppose to keep us safe truly hurts. We have to agree that we have a racism problem in the Qld Police Service because without acknowledging it we continue to skirt around the issue and pin it to only "few rogue ones" . @KatarinaCarroll the Qld police Commissioner what are you doing about this? Fix it and fix it now. The members of the Police Service accused of this horrendous racist language, attitudes and behaviours must face very harsh penalties.  #Racism causes harm..racism can kill!#QueenslandPolice#RacisminQldPoliceService #endracism #notoracism@ScottMcDougall #theguardianaustralia

#IRNewswires #breakingnews#MeredithKammlerLondon, UKhttps://bit.ly/3DDjyUX (U.S. Atty (SDNY) conspiracy to obstruct justice).Lest We forget...November 11, 1831, Nat Turner hanged in Jerusalem, Virginia...The rebellion was suppressed within two days, but Turner eluded capture until October 30, when he was discovered hiding in a hole covered with fence rails. On November 5, 1831, he was tried for "conspiring to rebel and making insurrection", convicted and sentenced to death. Turner was hanged on November 11 in Jerusalem, Virginia, now known as Courtland, Virginia. His body was flayed, beheaded and quartered. In the aftermath of the insurrection there were 45 slaves, including Turner, and 5 free blacks tried for insurrection and related crimes in Southampton. Of the 45 slaves tried, 15 were acquitted. Of the 30 convicted, 18 were hanged, while 12 received mercy and were sold out of state. Of the 5 free blacks tried for participation in the insurrection, one was hanged, while the others were acquitted.The Supreme Court Justice was Jeremiah Cobb, and it was he, that ordered Nat Turner to be hanged, flayed (his skin was removed), beheaded and quartered.After Turner's execution, a local lawyer, Thomas Ruffin Gray, took it upon himself to publish "The Confessions of Nat Turner", derived partly from research done while Turner was in hiding and partly from jailhouse conversations with Turner before trial. Though seriously flawed, this work is the primary historical document regarding Nat Turner.#work #lawyer #supremecourt #research #privateequity #management #investments #work #law #money #law #corruption #legal #legalprofession #legal #lawyers #lawyer The Wall Street Journal The New York Times The National Law Journal MSNBC NBC News #AlexanderSouthwell Breon Peace Larry Mandala Baker McKenzie Dechert LLP Don Samuel Sally Yates The Washington Post USA TODAY ProPublica VICE News Howard Fischer Orin Snyder Manny Arora #money Margaret Garnett Daniel Gitner Fried Frank Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP #nicholassgoldin Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Affiliates Kirkland & Ellis Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz #blm #blacklivesmatter #racism #JimCrow #racialprofiling #DamianWilliams #ChuckSchumer #bribery #london POLITICO USA TODAY Dechert LLP Jones Day Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP #markets #investments #wallstreet #fraud #corruption #lawenforcement #police #lawfirm #money #investment #invest #media #news #marketing #investmentbanking Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP Latham & Watkins #privateequity

Essential Reading: Vamik Volkan on Large Group PsychologyApropos of the current global sociopolitical climate...TRAUMA, PREJUDICE, LARGE-GROUP IDENTITY AND PSYCHOANALYSISAmerican Journal of Psychoanalysis (full text below)Excerpt:Among the factors that help children to stop being “generalists” (Erikson, 1956) and absorb their large-group identity, we consider their identifications with the parents’ and other important persons’ narcissistic investments in their own large-group identities, as well as prejudices about Others. Psychoanalytic studies about transgenerational transmissions also illustrate how parents and other important adults deposit images and ego tasks in children’s developing identities.Under certain circumstances individuals subsume their personal identities behind their large-group identities and hold fast to large-group identity over individual identity openly or in hidden ways. https://lnkd.in/euSNXnB9 #trauma #psychology #midterms2022 #prejudice #racism #antisemitism #psychoanalysis #hate #traumaprevention #grouppsychology #socialpsychology

The call to the Church in the United States is to be an agent of reconciliation. The church is not broken, but we’ve allowed our racism and injustice to destroy us from within. Shock & Awe is a wake-up call for leaders who have been paralyzed by fear and inaction. The time has come for leaders across denominational lines to hear God’s call: Be ambassadors of reconciliation. We can answer God’s call together as the Body of Christ.

Well, I suppose some say, and not that I might say, although I might say that we should have done more to make things worse for the average American than they were. I think I think that it is possible when we look at creating possibility, that had we done more damage people would have blamed Biden more as they should have blamed Biden and Democrats more based on the fact we had no solutions to anything and do not care to. Ultimately we will achieve staggeringly large tax cuts for the rich in spite of the will of the people. Doing this makes me tingle.Satire.Not a real quote.#trump #election #veteran #VeteransVoteBlue #votevets#morality #humandecency#jaildoctors #journalism #arizona #obama #economy #georgia #pelosi #violence #ownthelibs #russia#racism.#prison #inflation #rape #getthevoteout #florida #northcarolina #nationalsecurity #legal#putin #fromwithin #crime #women #Novemberelection #guns #ohleg #moredocuments.#romney #utah #2012election #mormon#GASPRICES #JESUS #legal #privacy #intelligence#affront #finalstroke #indignity #lastlick #limit #matchinthepowderbarrel #overload #provocation #strawthatbrokethecamelsback#VoteHerOut .#leaders #empathy #ethics#fundraising #rationalthought #adulteducation #ohio #ohiostate #vote#climatechange #Qanon #election #texas #GregAbbot #warning #choosing #republican #vote #act #american #democrat #danger #toxic #mankind #corrupt #theJesus #God #jail #dies#specialmaster #florida #transport #immigration #within #justice #voters #maga #department #dictatorship #threat#felon #desantis #FLORIDAFREE #settlement #hoax #nationalsecurity #maga #republicans

Racist remarks about people's appearances, speech, and identities, as well as harsh judgments about their qualifications, are often so common that they barely register with the person dishing them out, making them all the more insidious.But they can take a serious toll on mental health and create a hostile work environment. Therefore, we need to be aware of such things and to do our best to avoid inflicting them on others. If you want to know about some common but unsuspecting microaggressions, then Read our blog “10 Things You Never Thought Were Microaggressions” 🔗 https://buff.ly/3A3gYpa #ToughConvos #dcmagna #microaggression #racialremarks #racism #equality #race #democracy #blackallies #blackmen #endracism #blackpeople #diversityequityinclusion #diversity #diversityandinclusion

Today, the Church is faced with an incredible opportunity. We are called to give God’s hope in Jesus Christ to all who have been touched by racism. We can do this by bringing our own racial biases and ignorance into the light of God’s presence and grace. Will you join in this holy journey as God calls us to be ambassadors of reconciliation?

👨🏿 It's #movember and its time to talk about Black Men and DIABETES 🍭So many health problems in Black Men can be linked back to institutional, structural and medical racism• According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the prevalence of diabetes in non-Hispanic Blacks is 11.7 percent, versus only 7.5 percent in non-Hispanic whites.One of the biggest reason is SOCIOECONOMIC factors.. which can be tied directly to YEARS OF RACIAL INEQUITY IN THE US"Obesity is one of the most significant risk factorsTrusted Source for the development of type 2 diabetes. Black Americans, especially Black women, statistically have higher rates of obesity than white Americans. ResearchTrusted Source has shown Black Americans face inequities, such as lower socioeconomic status and limited access to nutritious food, that may contribute to these higher rates of obesity.In one 2014 studyTrusted Source, researchers investigated the link between poverty and diabetes prevalence. According to this study, Black Americans and poor white Americans have higher rates of diabetes than non-poor white Americans.In addition, under-resourced socioeconomic groups experience higher levels of stress, which is believed to increase diabetes risk in people who are predisposed to the disease.Multiple studies have shown associations between both acute stress and long-term stress and the development of diabetes. However, more research is still needed."https://lnkd.in/eFH7z6gG#diabetes #diabetesawareness #blackmen #africanamericanmen #blackhealth #blackhealthmatters #menshealthawareness #menshealth #medicalracism #institutionalracism #racism #fooddesert #health

Organizations like the National Institute of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are now utilizing Critical Race Theory (CRT) to link transgenerational trauma—and the structural systems of oppression that cause it—to a myriad of measurable life-shortening health issues no longer attributable to debunked genetic claims of race.The significance of these findings, once fully comprehended, will be transformative; they scientifically verify both the existence and essentiality of individual Liberty, by enumerating the toxic effects of suppressing It.https://lnkd.in/g4RujHS2...#criticalracetheory #crt #democracy #racism #government #equality #blm #economics #capitalism #socialism #trauma #oppression #thirdoption #nationalpublicbank #inclusivity #creativity #justice
