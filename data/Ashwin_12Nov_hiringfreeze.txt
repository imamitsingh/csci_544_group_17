Here's 1️⃣ reason why your resume is not working. It is missing……core competencies.
Core competencies are so important 🔥
because they list the specific skills
that hiring managers can look at quickly.
Without it, what they see 👀 is someone
who doesn't really understand
what they bring to their day-to-day roles. 😳 There are common core competencies
such as leadership, delegation,
time management organization,
critical thinking, creative thinking,
and problem solving skills.
Core competencies give you an additional benefit which is…

Please don’t forget about the thousands of people impacted by layoffs who did not work at Meta, Twitter (insert other big tech name where people got unbelievable severances). Some of us (me) just never wanted to work at  social media companies where you were just a number. That doesn’t indicate skill level.#contentdesign #layoffs #meta #contentdesignleader #opentowork #opentoconnect

Sadly, I am a part of the 13% #metalayoffDespite not-so-pleasant news, I was lucky to work with many incredible people. This support, level of professionalism, knowledge sharing and empathy of every single person I've met at Meta are impressive. I want to especially thank Katy Flynn for her above-and-beyond-carrying attitude. If anyone is in a need of Technical Recruiting expertise in Hamburg, or Germany remotely - more than appreciate any help since I am  #OpenToWork. I’m Ukrainian 🇺🇦 citizen holding my German 🇩🇪 visa. This means that my timeline for the job search is quite shortened and if I do not find another job this visa expires.

Hi connections,As a part of my curriculum at the UW Foster MSIS, I recently analyzed the various security and privacy concerns at Facebook over the years and presented them with some amicable solutions today. As I prepare myself to build tech products that affect the masses, understanding the network and data architecture is very important in order to design secure systems and mitigate risks. I would like to thank all my team members for their efforts - Gayatri, Asma, Pankhuri, Ghrinjs and Sabreena.This is a tough time for the tech industry with several firms announcing #layoffs. My deepest sympathies to all those affected by it. I strongly believe in the idea of community and this is a time for all of us to stand strong together. So if there’s anything that I could help you with, do not hesitate to reach out!

With so much that is happening around us, it is difficult to keep your mental strength. I was struggling to find the determination to start a healthier life and I came across this podcast.

Helping others and being compassionate are part of human nature (I like to see it that way). LinkedIn Recruiter 𝐅𝐈𝐑𝐒𝐓 filter is the ability to find people that are open to work. And I guarantee you, good recruiters will want to look for those people first - at least, they are my primary focus. It just makes sense. Either you want to put the green banner up or just add open to work where only recruiters can see, DO NOT ever THINK THAT THAT WILL MAKE YOU LOOK DESPERATE. I felt that before, but the moment I decided to add the green banner to my profile, I got my current job through networking within a couple of weeks or even less. Layoffs is a business decision, it’s not a personal failure. You’re more than that 💙🙏🏻💙#layoffs #greenbannergang

“Meta laid off 11,000 employees but is that the only cost-cutting measure possible?”• Layoff is “losing livelihood” for 11,000 peopleThis is just one of the companies that is making it to the headlines but so many start ups, tech companies in India are doing that as well.I have done cost & process analysing for 3 years professionally and even as a third party hired to “cut down cost” : our first resort would be reducing internal inefficiencies, perk up budget. Layoff would never be an option. When I actually research and deep dive further in general for companies :• Can the free food to employees be not cut instead?• Can the events and grandeur be cut down? • Can the perks like gym, “salon”, etc be not cut down for employees? • Can budgets be not reallocated? • if employers sign contracts for employees, can there be no way that there is protection given to employees for a couple of months mandatorily before layoffs ? • Profits are never split upto employees but losses are always somehow trickled down to them• Should not every company be mandated to keep fund reserves atleast to support 6 months of employees even if the company makes losses?  It is exactly like how BSE / NSE asks for reserve fundsJob security has been a concern for so many with news. “what if it is us next” And this results into so many unaddressed issues like anxiety, trauma and more. And this also makes me realise the importance of “savings” an old age word which is trickled down by parents but GenZ is not used to it. We believe in “living in the moment”Having an emergency 🆘 fund is important. How are you feeling about this?#usa #metalayoffs #metalayoff #layoff #cost #tech #layoffs #finance

Along with the many other layoffs we've been hearing about recently, I'm disappointed to share that my company has also eliminated me. Even though my time at Underknown was cut short, I'm proud of the content we've been able to create on our show, Around the World, and the impact I've had since I started. (Over 45 million views on Facebook alone dating back to May)With that being said, I have a lot to offer in my next role. My experience spans across production management, video editing and content creation, project management, podcast hosting/production, and on-air broadcasting. I've worked in a variety of sectors such as entertainment, sports, and business/entrepreneurship.If you know of anyone who is hiring or needs assistance on any projects, please keep me in mind. I'm open to any and all connections and really appreciate your consideration. #layoffs #jobsearch #opentowork

"Consultations""Headcount optimization""Rightsizing""Job reductions"What other unhelpful, sugarcoated and indirect ways have you come across for saying "layoffs"?Genuine question: Does the term really matter if the action is the same? People are losing jobs. They are losing livelihoods...this means not just a paycheck but a sense of identity, steady source of income, meaning and relationships. Already minoritised and marginalized communities will be most impacted. Even in companies taking a "racial equity lens" during layoffs aren't getting it right...facing resentment from survivors and laid off employees alike.What are the best, or at least, the least harmful things you've seen organizations do when they're considering #layoffs?
-----------------------------
In light of the recent #layoffs you have most likely seen on LinkedIn, I want to again offer my resources to help anyone affected.Most of us have been taught to carry all of our stress on our own, but let's be honest...

For everyone, take note of how an employer treats folks on the way out. Just as important, if not more, as the way they treat people on the way in. Note, who remembers it’s people not just employees at the end of the day, treats them with dignity, and empathizes with resources, severance, and more. For those who haven’t experienced layoff before, remember, this can be you one day and as employees, we should all be mindful of this. #peoplefirst #layoffs

#Meta layoffs 11000 workers#Twitter lay off half employeesMany of the employees are also doing the same ... #byjus and #unacademy are completing to see who can fire employees faster! The problem with edtech startups like #byjus , #unacademy and #vedantu  is they don't have any Ed and they don't have any tech either!Hire fast Fire fast , this has been the trend ..It's really heartbroken after reading the post of the people who are part of the #layoffs.Is it really necessary to lay off employees for the reason of cost cutting?  Is really nt fair ...I just don't understand what is the point of working so hard to get into these #big #companies when they're #laying #off #thousands of #employees.We are not failing as an employee or an individual ,,Actually companies are failing as an employer, business owners ! It's a #bitter #truth..It's a humble request to everyone if possible please try to help these employees who lost their jobs in every possible manner because Stretching your hand to a needed person is much better than raising your hand above the head ,infront of God ...! Do the right thing, in a right manner, at a right time ..🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻#layoffs #helpajobseeker #behelpinghand #standout

Potentially unpopular opinion incoming.. But I've wanted to post about this topic for a while, so here it goes.Every time I see a post on here from someone who hasn't been active in months/years, and they're asking for help finding a job after a spontaneous layoff.. Only one thought comes to mind."Where were you when things were going well?" 🙃Yes, it's a shame that spontaneous layoffs have hit so many people. Nobody deserves to lose their job so abruptly, especially so unceremoniously. But it makes no sense to me when people expect their network -- a network with whom they've never engaged and have no real connection with -- to help them find new work 😐𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙗𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙪𝙞𝙡𝙙 𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨 𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙜𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙬𝙚𝙡𝙡. 𝙄𝙩'𝙨 𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙜𝙞𝙫𝙚 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚.You give to your network when you can. You share your knowledge, expertise, and stories. You listen to them, you advise them, you engage with them. You use LinkedIn to make friends and business contacts.And in turn, you can hope that they'll be there for you when you need them most.But if you're never on LinkedIn, and you only show up only the second that YOU need something...You kind of give off the vibe of that one friend from 10 years ago who only shows up in your life when they need to borrow some money 🤷‍♀️I'm all for helping people, but I just can't understand those who expect their network to come to their rescue, even though they never cared about their network when things were going well.𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙗𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙪𝙞𝙡𝙙 𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨 𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙜𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙬𝙚𝙡𝙡.

Meta Layoffs ✂️It’s heartbreaking 😔One of my friend joined Facebook 3 months back, it took months of preparation be part of one of FAANG companies.Yesterday he called me and expressed himself that what anxiety and fear he is going through….From 3 months back to this day,he keeps telling me that mass layoffs happening all around whenever we talk.He said he is feeling that same thing today as there has been anxiety all over internal communication channels, and nobody knows what will happen Tommorow, how many good byes……He said it’s 3 am in morning and everyone is checking their mails and internal groups… it’s tensed all around ! He needed support, 🥺Companies and startup’s have to come upfront to help them as they are one of the best talents ! We at AlmaBetter coming up with initiative of hiring rather than laying offs ! Interested candidates can refer to openings and can become part of young and energetic team. 🚀Drop in your resume 🙈📩#faang #layoffs #meta #engineer #hiring #facebook #startup #team #communication #resume #openings #help

I'm looking for a TA Leadership role. How can you help? A referral, making an introduction, providing a LinkedIn recommendation, commenting words of encouragement. I would appreciate any and all support right now.This week has been hard. I even wrote a post about it on Thursday. After pouring my heart out to help support so many on how to move forward after being laid off, yesterday I got a firsthand seat on a zoom to hear the same news for myself. I was so surprised! (now I understand the depths of everyones feelings in that moment- why me? how do I tell my family..especially my kids? etc.) After the call, I was numb to my thoughts and feelings most of the day because as a leader, (which btw- I've always said you dont need a title to be a leader!) my people came first. I immediately turned to help those affected yesterday. I spent most of my day having conversations with others who were also impacted, offering support and words of encouragement. I also had a lot of conversations with those that were not affected (Thank you to all of those that reached out to me! I appreciate you!) but, the important part was to also send them words of encouragement. They may not be working alongside me, but now I'm only one call, text, or LI message away! The folks that I've worked with, and alongside of,  for the past 1.5 years are some of the most talented and wonderful people that I know. I only want the best for each person as they continue their professional journey. (I told y'all I love BIG!) Yesterday I changed my banner to "Open to Work" (Thank you to all who noticed and made introductions.) Today, I'm putting my status out there for everyone to see that I'm looking for a new TA Leader role. If you are looking for a TA leader who can build and lead great teams, a leader who encompasses company values, one who becomes your brand ambassador and believes in your mission and your people, one who understands senior leadership and the importance of moving the company forward in growth and profitability- with a true leadership mindset, one who works as a team and collaborates wholeheartedly in a way that is mission driven to the organizational goals, one who pivots on a dime and jumps in throughout the organization based upon the need for company success (L&D, employee engagement, etc) without direction, one who truly understands that when you take care of your people...they will help take care of the business. There is so much more to me than this post, my profile, and even my resume. All these things are just words and I believe my actions and the results speak so much louder. I'm excited to see what happens next on my journey, as I have so much to offer any great organization. Always remember...Kindness, Changes Everything! #opentowork #leadership #talentacquisition #layoffs

#Pharma2022 #Layoffs!No Offence to anyone or to any organisation who has made fun of low ctc's & start-up companies who has been ethical to their Professional work and Employees.Recently 20,000+ employees were laid off by Cognizant, 400+ by Bioclinica, 10-20 % laid off by Healthminds, 400+ by Novartis, 550+ by accenture ,100+ by Covance ,232+ by Iqvia, 6000+ by Sanofi, 25% from TCS, 270+ by PPD, 350+ laid off by Quinecsa, 100+ by Syneos , 850+ by Parexel, 360+ by AbbVie , 300+ by Indegene, 1,400+ by Takeda, 2300+ by AstraZeneca recently and there are rumours of layoffs in Wipro as well (around 20 laid off for now) & Big layoffs coming for Novartis, Sumitomo, Valneva and there are many more which are not on the news yet.Kindly note, I'm not highlighting companies instead I'm highlighting the current situation. I'm pretty sure all the companies had their reasons and the laid off employees accept that too. So, when anyone says I want to get into Pharma Domain. Kindly research thoroughly and try to get into a good company rather than just going after the high ctc’s and MNC’s name in the CV. Growth is everywhere!! P.S. I didn't write this post to scare you off but just a reality check of what is happening in the market.#pharma #pharmacovigilance #research #biopharma

I have heard of several companies laying off employees recently, and so many people are impacted. If this is you, know that I have, unfortunately, been in your shoes twice before and know how painful and disruptive the experience can be. You are NOT alone. You WILL bounce back. You ARE worthy.Atlassian continues to hire at this time and has done throughout the 1 year and 9 months I have been here so far. For someone who has experienced the fear of #layoffs in the past, the continuous growth at #Atlassian has been really encouraging to me. Maybe there is a role here that feels like a good fit for you? Let me know if I can help refer you.

The true empathetic way of laying off employees on visa is by giving them extra days on payroll equivalent to the period for which you wanted to give them severance pay.If you're a CEO or C-level executive who is planning on laying off employees in US, I'm sure you want to do it as empathetically as possible and it's not an easy decision for you. The best way to show empathy to employees on visa in US is to give them time on payroll equivalent to the time you planned to give them severance pay. This will give them extra time to find a job in addition to the 60 days given by USCIS at the end of which, they need to pack their lives and leave US.Btw this is my personal opinion.#visa #h1bvisa #layoffs

#meta employees get a 16 week severance package along with other benefits from their layoff. #randstad  gave us an additional 1 week of pay and our remainder PTO days (which we were only given 8 days in a year). I’m not saying a layoff is easy for anyone, but it is much easier for some than some others right now. Please consider reaching out to not just people posting about their layoffs from large organizations, but anyone looking for a job, and respond to people who are reaching out to you. Not all of us get the same benefits as others during these times. #awareness #layoffs #jobsearch #hiringmanagers #recruiters #newjobs

To the Facebook/Meta peeps who got laid off; I am very sorry, and my heart goes out to you. I have a very good working knowledge of what you’re probably feeling, right now. I found myself in a similar boat, only a few months ahead of you. The first week was harder than I’d ever anticipated. Hurt in ways I never saw coming. Felt like there was a battle going on in, and for, my soul. Turns out, there actually was. I would love to chat with anyone of you who would like to talk. I can tell you more about the hope I have, and the way it has worked out for my good, and far beyond what I could have ever asked or imagined.  #facebook #meta #layoffs

It is very unfortunate to see many people are getting laid off in IT industry. #Twitter, #Meta and many more are in the list. If you are looking for a job in Tech industry, you can apply at #Visa.

That is the culture of Visa, we all are part of one family. You will get the opportunity to work on world class payment products. Here is the link  https://lnkd.in/gEezC2YG.

I've worked for Meta for almost 6 years. This morning I woke up in a panic to some of the worst news I've ever received. I was part of the #metalayoffs. I'm still processing what this means. Unfortunately my husband was also part of layoffs last year for his company, and so we're both currently unemployed. This leaves us to make some really tough decisions. And in desperate need of work. As part of my #30daysofgratitude challenge this month, I want to share my gratitude for everyone who greatly impacted my life at Meta. I was pushed beyond my comfort zone and asked to grow in ways I never thought I could. My time there was absolutely invaluable.  And there are so many of you who contributed to that. Stephanie Carroll Angela Gonzalez Frederick Chandra John Marullo who were the best teammates I could have asked for, and truly cared about me as a person. And I know we will be friends for many years to come!So what's next?Well, I'm open to new opportunities! Now more than ever I ask my network to support me by sharing my profile and keeping an ear out for opportunities that would fit my experience. Please share my profile and resume as much as you can. And share any job postings you come across that would be a good fit! My experience includes: events, project management, people manager, recruiting operations, people operations, program management. #meta #facebook #layoffs #opentowork

I Was A Full-Time Employee @ Meta for 3 Days...For the past 3 years, I have worked at Meta Platforms mainly in iOS Mobile Development as a Software Engineering Intern - taking on and completing projects that Full-Time Software Engineers face in an average 12-week sprint. I loved working at Meta, and I have grown so much as a programmer & teammate through my past experiences. I was ecstatic to accept a Full-Time Software Engineering Role to work at the company and started on November 7th.I felt so prepared to contribute and collaborate in just this first week, but unfortunately, I was part of the employees impacted by the #MetaLayoff.  Fortunately, this means I am back on the job market and I am looking for a new role as soon as possible! I'm excited to take the skills I have built at Meta into another position.As I start this journey, I would be so grateful for any and all advice support, and referrals in this next chapter. Thank you in advance for all the love and assistance you provide in this challenging time.As I part ways with Meta, I want to thank all of the teams I have served on in the past. From Instagram Design Systems to Facebook Public Groups,  I have learned and grown so much in the presence of such skilled and ambitious colleagues. Additionally, to my first experiences on the Menlo Park Campus as a part of FBU, I'm so thankful for all of the forever friendships that were formed back in 2019. To others no longer at #Meta that find themselves impacted by this news similarly, let us all have faith. Even through these trying times, there is something great JUST FOR US at the end of this testimony. Everything happens for a reason, and I look forward to the day when I think of this time and smile.  #openforwork #opportunity #techcareers #recruiting #layoffs #layoffs #harvarduniversity #softwareengineer #blackintech #grateful

Sometimes, #layoffs are absolutely necessary for the survival of a company.However, most times they’re done by companies with plenty of cash in the bank, just to reach some arbitrary number “The Street” wants. I’m proud to work for a company that plans for the long term and places so much importance on its employees.11,000 people are losing their jobs at #meta today. More than 3,000 at #twitter just last week. As much as I disagree with those companies, their products, customer experience and how terrible they are for our society, I can’t help but feel bad for those employees affected and their families. Those two are not mutually exclusive.Just in the last couple days I had a a few recruiters reach out with some cool marketing positions (but as you can tell I’m not going anywhere). If you’re a marketing leader looking for a new gig, reach out on DM and I’ll be happy to pass along your name to these recruiters.

My timeline is flooded with news of another major tech company doing #layoffs and I am saddened to hear it. For anyone in tech I strongly encourage you to check out the job opportunities at PandaDoc, I've been with the company for over 2 months now and can't stop raving about how amazing it is. If you're in my network and we've previously worked together, I'd be more than happy to refer you should I believe you'd be a good fit. #tech #jobopportunities #network  Offering any and all support that I can to my LinkedIn family!

Recently, layoffs have made things worst in times of recession and a falling economy.With the big layoffs that happened last week, I visualized the layoffs data for the past three years (2020-2022) from layoffs.fyi on tableau for better insights.Please have a look at my Tableau Story:https://lnkd.in/gA_P7sgsMy findings from the analysis of data on Tableau are:⭕ From 2020 to 2022, the year 2021 had the least layoffs.⭕ Because of Covid, the first Quarter of 2020 had the most layoffs, while the rest year was stable.⭕ Unfortunately, the year 2022 has the significant layoffs since the start. ⭕ Month of November with the highest number of layoffs in 2022 (Because of Meta layoffs).⭕ The top three countries facing the most layoffs are the United States, India, and Brazil.⭕ Consumer, Transportation, and Real State industries are most affected, while Legal, Product, and Aerospace industries are least affected by layoffs in the USA.⭕ Meta, Uber, and Peloton have had the highest number of laid-off employees in the past three years. Also, worksheet 6 shows no significant layoff trend for the past years.⭕ San Francisco Bay area, New York City, and Boston have the highest layoffs.⭕ Companies in IPO Stage have the most layoffs in all three years.⭕ This is surprising, but Total layoffs and funds raised are directly proportional. Increases in fundraising have also caused layoffs.⭕ In the Bay area, fundraising has caused fewer layoffs than before. Similarly, a decrease in fundraising has caused more layoffs.I hope it gives a better understanding of layoffs. Suggestions are always welcome.#layoffs #bayarea #usa #jobs #usajobs #bayareajobs #metalayoffs #meta #tableaupublic #tableau #dataanalytics #data #visualizations

Terrible week and it’s so hard to find words. While I was not impacted by the RIF at Meta/Facebook, it’s heartbreaking to see so many talented colleagues and team-members either leave the company or enter a multi-week consultation process to find out definitively if their role is impacted. These people are the best of the best in their jobs and it has been a privilege knowing them and working with them. Design is a small world and if you’re a hiring manager out there, this is a rare opportunity to add world-class talent to your team. Check out the resources below.If you’re an impacted designer or UX professional (at Meta or any other company given how bad these past few weeks have been) and need a friendly ear to discuss options, review your portfolio, or just talk, I’m a DM away. Please don’t hesitate to connect.#yougotthis #layoffs #careers

It is good to see employers who are investing in the last moments of someone’s career by helping them transition to a new career. When a large employer here in Omaha let 1000+ people go a few years ago, some of the employees got severance, but most all non-union employees got career counseling.  It was helpful, but 3-4 months to determine the next best step would be helpful to almost everyone.  Good data.. where does your company stand?

The job search. Where to begin? I am having this conversation a lot now. #maang as the go to companies no longer offers the express hire path. Where to look? Where to begin. Step 1 is NOT the resume update. That follows. The first step is plan and perspective. Where do you want to go. Your goals. Your desired impact. Your culture fit. Your assets…what do you bring to an organization. Second step is market survey. Who is growing. Who has people working on exciting problems. Where do you have a network to tap into. Did you know the “east apply” button is a tool created by the job posting websites to generate revenue? It is NOT to get you, the candidate betters odds to be invited to interview. There is an “application fallacy” that is not well understood. Job posting sites want as many applications as possible. Then, you end up in a crowd with 100s or 1000s of applicants. Talk to humans. I recently reached to an organization to talk about a role I am researching. It took 7 people and a few messages to get 1 meeting. I will take that vs 300 easy applied and 5 interview invites. Oh…third step is networking. Fourth step in parallel with networking is to update the resume. Many job seekers skip steps or go out of sequence. The job search is much like the sales process. Step by step. This is what we do at Archer Career, take job seekers from here to there, guiding the path and navigating the steps and rock slides. #metalayoffs #layoffs #jobsearchadvice #jobsearchhelp #jobhunt #career #archercareer

Want to be a blessing? FOR FREE! 1.) Search the following hashtags: #openforwork #layoffs #laidoff, #lookingforwork  etc.  2.) Look for post from people who were just laid off and/or looking for work. 3.) Comment on their post so more 👀 will see it. They’re stressed and knowing they’re not alone means a ton. Hope changes things. They don’t have to be a connection.  You don’t even have to know them, but you could end up completely turning things around for them.  👍🏽  #beablessing

Facing #layoffs or in a competitive #jobsearch? Follow these tips to learn how to stand out and land the offer.It’s estimated that 250 (if not thousands) apply for each job opening. Take time to really stand out for 10-15 of those, rather than randomly applying to 100’s of jobs. Here’s how:✪ Make sure those 10-15 positions are “target companies” and places where you really want to work.✪ Connect with a handful hiring managers, recruiters, and others from those companies on LinkedIn. Follow company pages, too. Find some people at your level who might be good referral partners. Like and comment on the posts of these people.✪ Reach out for informational interviews and learn more about the company and industry – don’t ask for a job but you’re seeking advice on moving into the industry and perhaps the company.✪ Create a stellar resume that really communicates your brand/strengths.✪ Ensure your LinkedIn profile is packed with keywords and is compelling when the recruiter / hiring manager comes to read your content.✪ When there is an opening, make sure you are qualified.✪ After applying through the proper channels, send your resume/cover letter to the hiring manger and let him/her know you applied. Engage your referral partner.✪ Send thank you notes.✪ Send 90-day action plans.Remember – your job is to STAND OUT from the competition to win an interview – and then to win the job offer.How else can you stand out?#careers

Institutional DeFI (a.k.a. never before have we needed more privacy, transparency, and credibility)Decentralized finance (DeFi), which uses blockchain-based smart contracts to execute a variety of financial services activities, has seized the attention of technology developers, investors, and financial institutions. DeFi protocols have already enabled nascent markets in the crypto-asset industry on public blockchains, such as borrowing and lending, as well as decentralized exchanges. Imagine the potential if the technology were applied to streamline transactions in foreign exchange, equities, bonds, and other real-world assets. This will require the creation of digital representations, or tokens, of real-world assets to bring them onto the blockchain. The cost savings and new business opportunities of creating a “tokenized” version of real-world assets for transacting through DeFi protocols could be significant for issuers, investors, and financial institutions that can adapt their technology and business models. #hupry is hiring; follow the Linkedin Page for the detailsFollow #hupry 👉 https://lnkd.in/eifJ6ypC#hupry #cybersecurity #privacy #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #ai #aiforgood #aiforall #ml #bigdata #datascience #dataanalytics #dataanalysis #data #datasecurity #datagovernance #financialservices #healthcare #scienceandtechnology #privacycompliance #privacycompliance #deeptech #deeplearning #devops #neuralnetworks #layoffs #layoff #engineers #java #javascript #python #mathematics

🛑 If you have been laid off and you are on a U.S. employment visa like the H-1B, first take a breath and know that you WILL get through this.Next, start taking proactive steps to plan for future U.S. visa stamping success. Don't panic or ignore the regulations. Even though it may be a while before your next U.S. visa interview, the time to prepare is now!Here’s what you need to know for your future visa stamp interview: - If you lose your job, your original employer will most likely notify USCIS of your employment being terminated. For the H-1B visa, once you cease to be employed, you have a maximum 60-day grace period to get another employer to sponsor you for H-1B employment, arrange to change to another status that allows you to stay in the U.S. (more on that below), or make plans to leave the United States. - At your next U.S. visa interview, your situation will be more complicated than your first application, and there is a higher risk for a visa denial or a 221(g) administrative processing outcome. You need to work proactively to prepare for that interview. - The Consular Officer will want to know the specifics of what happened when you lost your job, and what you did afterwards to comply with U.S. immigration law. Don’t be vague! - It is best to be proactive when sharing this information with the Visa Officer, and not appear to be withholding information, such as when you switched to another employer, how you changed status, and when you left the country. - If you choose to change status to a B visa to have more time in the United States, how you frame your situation and discuss what you did during that time at your next visa interview is crucial. For example, when you’re on an H-1B visa you can have “dual intent” to stay in a temporary visa status even though steps have been taken towards obtaining U.S. permanent residence, but on a B visa, you can’t. So be prepared to give additional context and explain your situation in an honest, authentic, and concise way. By getting organized and having a plan, someday soon you will look back on this period as just a small blip in your career in the United States. #H1B #layoffs #visainterview #visaexperts #consularprocessing #USembassy #USconsulate

I'm endlessly bummed to wake up every day to news of layoffs to folks that are either directly in my network or part of the greater #talentacquisition ecosystem.  As a #recruiter  myself, I know we take great care in being many folk's first opportunity to connect with a company and brand - and it's a tough thing to have that end prematurely. I'd like to help our folks in recruiting specifically as I know after the pandemic boom, a lot of us probably weren't anticipating this slowdown happening so abruptly.As a LinkedIn employee I am able to gift a number of LinkedIn Premium Subscriptions for 6 months. LinkedIn Premium is a great tool for those seeking new employment. IF YOU ARE A RECRUITER OR ARE IN TALENT ACQUISITION - Please feel free to message me directly if you would have a use for this membership and I'd love to send this gift your way.  I would love to pay this forward to some folks that are looking for a hand and don't know where to go next - and maybe some day we can help each other down the road.  I only have a couple of these left so I will update when they are taken.Also - if you want to message me for any help or resume help - I'd be happy to help if I can at the moment.  I have a lot of connections of course and tend to get inundated quickly when I open this up, so I will do the best I can to help.#linkedinnetworking #layoffs #network #linkedinlife #recruiterjobs

Meta lays off 11,000+ workers to cut costs in the wake of poor profitability & rising costs.📌What lies for Meta (Facebook) in the future: The end of Meta or a Trillion Dollar opportunity. 📌Mark Zuckerberg's net worth was approximately $100 bn & Facebook was a $1 Tn company in 2020 (only 1 in 5 companies to have a market cap more than this).📌Mark's current net worth is only $37 bn & Meta's market value has dropped to $560 billion.𝐀 𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲:👉People made fun of Mark when he paid $1 bn for the photo-sharing app Instagram, questioning what he would do with it.▶And now the whole world is dancing on reels & Instagram is now worth $100 billion+.👉Then, after he paid an enormous $19 billion for WhatsApp, he was criticized by some for doing so because WhatsApp lacked a viable business model. ▶And now, even if WhatsApp goes down for just 10 minutes, we assume that our network or phone is to blame.👉But in 2014, he paid $2 billion to acquire Oculus. ▶And he's into something really big with this.📌Here’s what👇: 👉Virtual reality mimics the real world by utilizing our spatial memory.🧠👉Today, people use their mobiles and laptops for 6-7 hrs every day.👉Mark Zuckerberg's goal is to make the virtual world seem realistic so that we will spend more time there than in the actual world. And people would socialize, work, and do all of their activities there.📌Mark is spending a lot of money on that to make the virtual world more lifelike.▶For instance, when on video conferences, we are aware that the person (avatar) we are speaking to is not physically present. 👉Additionally, the avatars also have a cartoonish appearance.👉For this, special Codec 2 avatars will be introduced, which will be extremely human-like. Furthermore, the audio quality will be such that you'll think the presenter is standing right in front of you.👉And if he would successfully do it, then we’d be spending more time there. (This might seem like a scam, but it'll soon become real; either by Mark or anybody else)That’s Mark’s vision. Mark Zuckerberg might become the 1st Trillionaire in history if his ambition comes true.📌𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐚?🔴However, something is not right here!👉This year, the virtual reality division of Meta has lost $9.4 billion.👉And the revenue from its reality labs had decreased by 50% annually.👉On the other hand, its primary businesses (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook) have seen a spike in sales and marketing costs but not in revenue.▶Despite this, Mark says that he will increase his investments in the virtual world goals in the next years.👉Do you think Mark Zuckerberg's fighting attitude will help him to achieve his vision of virtual reality?🤔#business #meta #facebook #layoffs #career #future

Leverage TA to build flywheels. Flywheels that build an employer brand. Flywheels that identify top talent.Flywheels that help you nurture passive candidates.Flywheels on top of employee referrals.Flywheels that deliver a premium experience for candidates.Business will bounce back. The engines you build will differentiate your growth when it does come back. And, the cost savings, the revenue generated will pay off multi fold.TA is not a cost function. It is a strategic lever.

For some reasons, we have always glamorized the difficult to work with, moody and eccentric leaders.They are considered as role models and the stories of how they made employees life hell are celebrated.How tough they were to work with, how they took No for an answer, how they pushed employees to the extreme and how their ventures got success because of them and then alone, a popular narrative throughout last few decades.Many people are in awe of what Musk is doing at Twitter. But, trust me, getting fired without any prior notice is not fun. It breaks my heart to see the posts of former Twitter employees who are forced to stay positive as bad mouthing your former employer is considered a red flag.Being yelled at, shouted at in public, being insulted and ridiculed is not something human beings should go through. It affects our mind, activates our flight or fight response and impacts the overall health.It's high time we change our role models, change the stories we want to take inspiration for.Insensitive leadership shouldn't be glamorized and appreciated if it comes at the cost of crushing human emotions. Their are enough CEOs and leaders who have got significant success despite being empathetic, caring and vulnerable. In a world getting crippled by mental health ailments, we need new set of role models who acknowledges the problems and work accordingly. A leader mandating employees to work 12 hours a day for 7 days, firing them without any planning or communication should be called upon and criticized not appreciated. Many of the recent Indian startups have done the same. Firing people in a single day notice just breaks the entire dream and future planning of a human being who based it basis the job. This century needs different set of leaders, the workplace problems and challenges have changed, the employees expectations and admirations also.Leaders with high IQ and low EQ shouldn't be the inspiration now, leaders with kindness, empathy and maturity should be.#layoffs #leadership #twitter #musk

The past two weeks have been a whirlwind on LinkedIn and my heart goes out to both those that were directly impacted by #layoffs but also the people that were left behind and are now worried about when the next round may come while carrying an even heavier workload. I think finding a company that is cash flow positive, growing with intention, and focused on providing a psychologically safe working environment is more important than ever. I know there are definitely still a ton of companies out there that offer that but I would also encourage you to take a look into Calendly. We're still #growing (with intention), we've been #profitable for years now, we aren't reliant on getting another round of funding, and the culture really is focused on #startwithhuman.

After a rough morning, I have been impacted by the #MetaLayoff along with some of my amazing, brilliant colleagues and will have to say goodbye to a company I truly loved. Despite the few months I spent in my role, the knowledge and experience I have gained working with content policy and risk analysis has been invaluable. Most importantly, thank you to my amazing mentors Gabrielle, Adrian, and Osaguona for imparting your wisdom and guidance on me. It made starting my first full-time job less scary and intimidating knowing I had y’all in my corner. Also, thank you to my incredible manager Joseph for being a great support system and always prioritizing my well-being, goals, and career development. Contributing to the Risk Management and Intelligence organization for the North America region has been an opportunity of a lifetime. Yet, I am more than eager to see what the future holds and where I can make an impact next. This layoff may have hurt, especially as a new grad in a new city, but I have trust and faith in my resiliency and abilities to bounce back even better! If you or anyone in your network knows of any opportunities in operations, HR, consulting, risk management, or other exciting roles, please share 🙏🏾 #layoffs #meta #jobhunt #facebook #instagram #techindustry

This morning I unfortunately got the news that I was part of the 13% layoff at #Meta Just a year ago I was gearing up for the interview process excited about the opportunity ahead. Meta was such a wonderful place and I am extremely grateful to have worked with the industry's best Designers and Recruiters. With that being said, I am open to opportunities and looking to take my passion for recruiting to my next role! Feel free to message me for openings or leads.#opentowork #layoffs #techindustry #metalayoffs

It’s been a rough month in tech.Companies like Meta, Stripe, Opendoor, Lyft, Coinbase, Shopify, Netflix, Microsoft, Snap, Robinhood, Chime, and Twitter have done massive layoffs.Even juggernauts like Apple and Amazon have implemented a hiring freeze.Yet, in every challenge, there is an opportunity.Many startups have solid foundations and will come out of the ashes stronger.Airbnb and Uber came out of the previous recession. I am pretty sure history will repeat itself.For everyone hiring right now, here you go, a solid database of +700 starts that have let go +110,000 people.A lot of great talent is looking for their next thing.#layoffs #hiring

At this point, most of us on here know someone who's been affected by the recent tech layoffs, or have at least heard about them.My curiosity drove me to dive deeper into this. Here are some interesting things that I found:-28% of all layoffs in 2022 occurred in the first 12 days of November-Twitter laid off the most workers relative to their total employees, around 50%! The next behind them is Opendoor at 18%-The most affected industries are finance and real-estate-Bay Area saw the most layoffs, with over 3x more than the runner up, NYC#tech #layoffs #dataanalytics

Lots of people are dusting off their resumes these days. This can be a pain, so I've created a template and tips to help get you started. Not saying that this is the very best format, but hey, it's what I used when I landed my job at LinkedIn! The key point is to focus on sharing your results - not your job description. Results differentiate you from others in the same role. Hope this helps and share it/tag someone that may find it useful! Be awesome. #layoffs #resumetips #resumehelp

While the recent Twitter  layoffs and impending recession layoffs are disheartening to watch, let us try to learn some lessons from the new unpredictable situations.Here you go.•	There is nothing called job security.Even the top-positioned employees couldn’t keep their job on Twitter.Everything depends upon the need of the company.•	You are always replaceable at a job.Your experience or skill set won’t help you hang in there.There will always be people who are willing to work more to replace you at a job.And the company will find them less expensive than you!•	It's not just Twitter, it can come to anyAnd though not just yet, it will soon come to any company, if the recession follows.Jobs are riskier than businesses.•	Entrepreneurship allows more control than taking jobs.If you own a business, the whole decisions are upon you.You are able to plan your life according to your income and are not answerable to anyone over you.•	It is almost impossible or very difficult to build wealth with a job.It is because getting a salary raise is a rare occurrence in a job.But in entrepreneurship, increasing income and thus building wealth is always possible with new strategies.•	Always remember that a job is a temporary income.Never take up permanent expenses like EMI upon job income.You can always lose your job and find no way to pay EMI.Invest in entrepreneurship and that helps you meet permanent expenses.With the right market study and learning, anyone can be an entrepreneur.The current layoff situation should be a wake-up call for all of us to think twice before depending solely on a job for our livelihood. #business #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship #building #learning #jobs #help #layoffs #planing #market

US$ 15 Billion. That's the amount Pharma giant Eli Lilly lost in market cap yesterday.Because someone paid $8 to get a Twitter Blue verified account impersonating the company and tweeted :"we are excited to announce insulin is free now"Shares of other top insulin players also suffered.***But this post is not about insulin or Eli Lilly or Pharma industry. Not even about how irrational share markets could be.This post is just to remind ourselves once again that we are living in very interesting times.This instance is just a glimpse of what happens when:- The Global digital town square is a private property. Aren't town squares supposed to be public property? - When you can easily 'buy' credibility and a voice in the town square by paying $8 - When the richest and supposedly the smartest person in the global village (err..town) can dictate the rules of engagement at the town sqaure on his whims- When you overnite fire half the people maintaining the town square without even fully understanding its plumbing, lighting, or landscaping***For now, #twitter has suspended Twitter Blue. But whoever said a genius can unilaterally make quick decisions discarding all institutional expertise and experience, please know:Such geniuses and their decisions have consequences that go far beyond them.#decisionmaking #leadership #layoffs #twitterblue

I think we should all be critical of companies who claim to be committed to prioritizing #diversity #equity and #inclusion but are laying off huge swaths of the professionals they employ to do that work on their behalf internally and externally (ERGs, HR, recruiting etc.). #Tech in particular we know has a diversity problem and I’ve see a number of folks who’ve dedicated their careers to fixing this problem  be part of the recent #layoffs and it is disheartening and a little frightening for what that could mean for representation in the industry. To the #DEI professionals who’ve found themeselves displaced — I am rooting for you just as hard as I know you’ve all always been rooting for us 🙏🏿🤎

Are You Being Quiet Fired? | As companies face tightening budgets, many may be considering trimming their workforce. But of course, outright layoffs are expensive and risky. That’s why some have turned to a subtler strategy: quiet firing, or intentionally creating a hostile work environment that encourages people to leave “voluntarily.” The authors’ new research sheds light on how employees can tell if they’re being quietly fired, including changes to work responsibilities, compensation, and communication, and offers ten tactical steps workers can take before throwing in the towel. #QuietFired #Layoffs #HostileWorkEnvironment #CompanyCulture #Belonging

Yesterday morning, I woke up to the unfortunate news that 11,000+ of the workforce at #meta were laid off. Sad to say, I was part of this group.While it is sad news, I appreciate getting to meet some of the nicest and most talented people I ever had a chance to work with. It made work enjoyable and fun. I, especially, will miss our game nights. 😜  During my 2+ years at Meta, I learned a lot from everyone (managers, engineers, designers, data scientists/engineers, researchers, product managers, etc...). I, also, had the unique and rare opportunity to build features in Instagram, which is enjoyed by literally Billions of humans around the world. That never ceases to amaze me.  As my journey with Meta ends, I'm excited about the next adventure. I'm starting my search for Senior Engineering roles and will be bringing my 13+ years of experience in Mobile (Gaming, Banking, AR/VR, Utility, Hardware Companions, etc..) My email is also open for any leads or reachouts! ehab@hamtaw.com #metalayoffs #layoffs #opentowork #badgepost

Friedrich Moritz August Retzsch’s painting, known as “Check mate” hung in the Louvre until recently.It depicts a forlorn man losing a chess game to a haughty devil as an angel looks on.The story goes that a chess master was visiting the Louvre and upon observing the painting, noticed something strange…The man hadn’t lost.In fact, he could still win.His King had one more move. To quote Walter D Wintle:“ If you think you’re beaten you are. If you think you dare not, you don’t. If you’d like to win, but think you can’t, it’s almost certain you won’t…. Life’s battles don’t always go to the stronger or faster man. But soon or late, the man who wins, is the one who thinks he can.”A lot of our problems relate to our attitudes and how we wish to perceive things. Being open and willing to see the moves that you can still make, could be the difference between personal victory and defeat.Wishing those out there who have been affected by the latest #layoffs the strength to see the moves that they can still make, even if you feel defeated.✌️

A story of #layoffs and #foreignworkers with a #happyending -- please read! #youhaveoptions A number of years ago, a former client reached out to me following a layoff from a #fortune500 company. He had been a C-level  employee, earning a serious salary, with corresponding obligations in the U.S.  It should go without saying that the #layoff knocked the wind out of his sails.  But he didn't have time to wallow; this was before the #60daygraceperiod was put in place, and so we had to find a solution for him urgently. He had had an idea for a #startup percolating in the back of his mind for some time, and the layoff forced his hand. He decided to launch!  Because he was from a treaty country, we were able to change his status to #E2visa, based on his investment in his own startup company. He and his family were able to remain in the U.S. during the #changeofstatus so that his children's schooling was not interrupted.  His wife was able to obtain #workauthorization as his dependent, which she had lost with his layoff. Had he not been from a treaty country, we also had an excellent case for an #O1Avisa. Ultimately, the layoff led to a #careerpivot that set him on a better path. I am protecting anonymity, but suffice to say that today he is ultimately much #happier and more #successful!#SanFranciscoLawGroup is here to support people who have been laid off. Please feel free to use my network -- I am happy to make introductions! If you are a foreign national, let's talk about your visa options!

Last morning I was part of the 11,000+ employee layoffs at #Meta. I was only at Meta for 3 months and feeling very disheartened as it is my first time dealing with something like this. I feel for everyone who is experiencing this and wish you all the best of luck in your futures.I want to thank my recruiters Ana Raquel Silva and Mamello Zokwe for giving me the chance when I first interviewed for a position at Meta. I would also like to to thank my manager Abdelrahman E. for always believing in me and giving me the support and guidance from day one. I really wish I could’ve worked with my great team for more than the 3 months I was an employee at Meta. But, I believe everything happens for a reason and hopefully this opens the door for new opportunities. Having said that, I’m currently open to work. If you have any opportunities relevant to my experience in Dublin or Remote please reach out to me at alkhedhir.alshadeedi@gmail.com or here on LinkedIn. Experience summary:Risk Management and Intelligence Market Specialist focusing on the MENA Region.

They say LinkedIn is the new #Facebook, but I bet you've never seen so many people from Facebook using LinkedIn.Most days, I’m awoken by one of my daughters stepping on my face, but yesterday I was awoken by an email from Mark Z. I was included in the 11000 called on to do extraordinary things outside of #Meta. After spending most of my career in executive roles at #startups, it was great to learn how to launch products that touched 2 billion users. I had an action-packed time at Meta, launching numerous products that either increased the safety of our #creators  or helped them make money.Most recently, as a Meta #Fintech PM, I owned the #authentication and #identityverification (#kyc #aml #idv #compliance #tax) of the creators and businesses who want to #onboard onto Meta’s over 80 #web3 and #payment products. Some new products our team recently helped launch were - Instagram #NFTs and #Subscriptions- #Oculus #Avatars - #Reels Stars and Play Bonuses- #Creator #MarketplaceIn my first year, I worked at Instagram where I launched products that increased #trust, #safety, and #algorithmic #transparency on the platform, launching:- Inform Treatments: increased transparency and minimized 3misinformation around Covid and elections - Sensitive Content Control: allowed users to manage the filters on the content #ranking #algorithm - Account Status: allowed users to understand why they were enforced against and could appeal any unfair decision Some links about the cool work I was able to do: -  https://lnkd.in/eGNDPT5h-  https://lnkd.in/erFejQRC- https://lnkd.in/eNf5HZgS- https://lnkd.in/eVgjHK24I am #opentowork and excited to learn about new opportunities at companies of all sizes.

Like thousands of others this week, I was part of the recent #MetaLayoff layoffs and am now looking for a new opportunity. While I am sad I won't be able to continue working at the company that I've spent the past 3 summers working at and with the people I have built relationships with, I'm still extremely grateful for the opportunities and connections the company has provided me these past few years. I loved working at Meta, and I have grown much as a programmer & teammate through my experiences. My heart goes out to those at Meta who were similarly affected. I'm now looking for a new grad / entry level Software Engineering role, either in the Seattle area or remote. I graduated from the University of Washington with Interdisciplinary Honors as well as a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Washington, and have completed 3 successful internships in Meta's fast-paced environment (iOS + full stack / backend web). I'm most experienced in iOS with additional skills in Java, Hack, and React Native, but I'm always excited to learn and apply new skills.  As I begin this journey, I would be grateful for any advice and referrals in this next chapter. If you or your connections know of companies that are hiring, please reach out to me via comments, DMs, or email (aaron.meheret@gmail.com). I'd be happy to send my resume or chat about opportunities. Thank you in advance for all the love and assistance you provide in this challenging time. As I part ways with Meta, I'm extremely grateful for the teams that I have worked with in the past, as well as the friendships I formed on the Menlo Park campus as part of FBU in 2019. To those similarly affected, I have faith that we all have our own path and these things happen for a reason. Doors close only for another to open, and I'm excited to see the opportunities awaiting us in the next chapter.  Thank you for reading and wishing everyone the best through this uncertainty.  #openforwork #opportunity #techcareers #recruiting #layoffs #layoffs #universityofwashington #softwareengineer #blackintech

My feed’s heavy with reposts of #metalayoffs badges & others who’ve lost their jobs in the #techlayoffs. Yours too maybe. But that’s not all I see.I also see an equal number of leaders in the #trustandsafety, #cybersecurity and #infosec communities offering support. 👏 Not thoughts and prayers, but actual support. Building bridges, making relationships and the community stronger and larger simply because it’s the right thing to do. I’ve only ever seen this type of camaraderie among groups who’ve (literally) sworn the same oath. It’s tremendous and inspiring. I’m proud to feel a part of this community and I bow to the Buddha in each of you. 🪷Thanks to Don Pinkus & Christopher Price for their inspiring posts & for walking the path. For those who need it, here are two great resources for those impacted at #meta.=========If you want to be contacted by companies interested in hiring you:https://lnkd.in/gPZmgVGjIf you are interested in hiring ex-Meta employees:https://lnkd.in/g8pTqjW4 #community #layoffs #osint #nisos

I’ve had to walk into the room after being laid off with tears and fear in my eyes, trying to keep a positive face for my baby. I’ve had to lay off child care while taking on the full time job of job hunting, interviewing, and completing technical interviews. I’ve lost countless hours of sleep and sanity due to the certainty of my future, my family’s future, being ripped out from under me. If this is something you’re going through, you are not alone. I will gladly review your resumes, hold mock interviews with you for feedback, or discuss pros and cons of job offers with those of you looking. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly for assistance, or even just for an open ear to talk about the weight of what you’re going through. Curves in the tunnel make it hard to see the light at the end. Your light is not lost. We’re #bettertogether #layoffs #hiring #resume #jobhunt #interviewing

If you’ve been laid off while on a visa, I know how scary the 60 day grace period can be. Here are three concrete things you can do if you are on a visa and have recently been laid off:💡 Extend your 60-day grace period to a total of eight months by filing a change of status from H-1B to another category, such as a visitor, student, or dependent spouse. You can use our free visa picker to see what visa might be right for you.https://https://lnkd.in/gVvPZ5BS💡 Create your own venture! This is an amazing time to start a new venture. While investment in later stage companies has declined, pre-seed and seed are still thriving and actively deploying capital.https://formally.com/individuals💡 You should start interviewing with new companies that are still hiring as soon as possible. Here is a link to some of the many employers (including Formally!) that are still looking for amazing team members. Here is a list of companies that are sponsoring visas and hiring. https://lnkd.in/g3PHbaY7******************************For employers:1️⃣ Comment below if you are hiring and willing to sponsor visas2️⃣ If you want to take advantage of this amazing moment to hire great talent and need help sponsoring a visa for an employee, dm me.

My 5.5 years journey at Meta came to an end, unfortunately I was a part of the layoffs yesterday at Meta. Coming from India and directly working at Meta (FB) was like a dream come true. I had immense pleasure working with many awesome, cool, talented people and I will miss my work at Meta. I want to thank all incredible talented Metamates, friends, my managers and leadership  for awesome support during this incredible journey.I feel so grateful and proud for my time spent at Meta working on meaning full and cutting-edge technologies. A mission to connect the un-connected through Open Cellular project has inspired me to join Meta, later on I got chance to work on proving a cost effective LTE Total site solution (TSS) again to enable un-connected in remote areas. For past 2.5 years worked on Meta Connectivity flagship project to enable RAN disaggregation solutions for which I built OpenRAN test facilities.Currently I am #opentowork and looking for new opportunities. As like many others I’m also on H1B, so time is crucial to find new job.  If you or your connections have any roles for RF Engg, Hardware Engg, RAN, O-RAN, Program Management please ping me on LinkedIn or share to my email srinivas.sriram@icloud.com#opportunity #RAN #RF #O-RAN #metalayoffs #layoffs #opentojobs #openforopportunities

Today, I woke up to the unfortunate news today that I was among the 11000 laid off at Meta. This was very hard on me as working at Meta/Facebook has been my goal since Freshman year, and I only got to spend a few weeks (In the Engineering bootcamp) at the company before I was laid off. I honestly enjoyed these last few weeks, I learned a lot, met some very smart folks, and pushed code for production.This is a very hard post for me to write as I am currently on an F1 Visa on my OPT, and already used most of my unemployment days, and would need to find another position related to my field as soon as possible, I can provide my resume (also available on my profile), and other information if needed.From my own calculation we had 90 days of unemployment, and I have exhausted around 85 of those days, before starting my employment at Meta - meaning I have around 5 more days of unemployment, after which I will have to leave the US.I have previously interned at a few companies including Arista Networks, Smartiron I have experience working on Back-end Systems, Infrastructure, and Front-end. Please feel free to reach out if you have any opportunities for me at abdul.a.abouzeid@gmail.com. Thank you.#Meta #Metalayoffs #layoffs #opentowork

Which is the right meditation for me ? People surf through meditation channels on Youtube as if they are selecting from a grocery list, then they keep jumping from video to video, and don’t know which one to settle with. Meditation brings calmness with awareness in your system. We want the most out of one meditation, but meditation is slow and steady progress. The mind loves time-travel, worrying about what will happen in the future or dwelling on regrets and blame from the past, meditation anchors it to the present.Allowing the mind to stay in the present, by accepting the mistakes of the past, and relaxing with the anxieties of the future makes the mind become gentle with the thoughts, that enter and exit.I follow Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Ji’s meditation as each meditation is so deep and Gurudev gives enough time to settle, there are fine nuances taken care of, and I love Gurudev's voice to dive deeper. There are hundreds of them on Youtube. Find any, play it, close your eyes, sit in a comfortable position and you are on. I usually shuffle them, as otherwise my mind knows the meditation-lyrics and start's guessing what’s coming next in the audio. Begin with any.Stay Strong. Indulge. #meditation #stress #happiness #future #layoffs #

With the news coming from the tech sector over the last week, it’s an extremely difficult time for the individuals impacted and their families. The sector has seen immense growth over the last 20 years, and will continue to be a valuable part of the Irish economy.

🐟Just keep swimming. We have all seen the posts. Folks who have worked their entire careers to get where they are there only to be laid off. I am connected to thousands of recruiters - comment on this post if you are looking for a role or looking to hire and connect with each other here! Recruiters - if you have job searching tips - leave in comments!Being laid off is emotionally draining and difficult. Especially for the person laid off, the folks still at the company who have lost their teammates and are also now required to do additional work and the entire circle of family and friends of everyone involved. At Jobot, we have nearly 700 recruiters who specialize in helping people get jobs. I’ve spent the majority of my career in recruiting and here are some tips:1. Update your LinkedIn and resume. Seems simple but dig deep and show your skills and accomplishments. 2. Focus on your mental health. Treat getting a new job like a regular job and take time on nights and weekends to unplug from your search and spend time doing something you love. 3. Since getting a new job is a job, set aside time to apply to every good job you see, explore options and connect with hiring managers on LinkedIn. The important thing: You are just looking for one Yes. The right Yes from the right company. Keep giving your best in every exchange and interview as that will increase your chances of getting a Yes that you want to say Yes to!Sending you good thoughts for a good job!💙🤖Heidi Golledge Find a good job at: Jobot.com#jobs #job #recruiters #recruiting #hiring #career #linkedin #mentalhealth #careers #layoffs #layoff #staffing

If you are affected by the recent layoffs in tech (Meta or elsewhere) and you are based in the UK on a Tier 2 visa, please consider applying to the UK Global Talent Visa.

HBR keeps serving me timely and relevant articles (I’ve got lots more to share!) but this one really hits home for a variety of reasons.I was laid off in late August from a job I really enjoyed. Like most people recently laid off, I was fully invested in the role and the company, envisioned a long career and didn’t (and still don’t) have a fully updated resume, LinkedIn profile, and my networking skills (never great to begin with) are quite rusty. I took the “take some time to process” to an extreme and only now a couple of months later am I really starting to jump into ‘the search’ and get myself back on track.If you or anyone in your network are looking to connect with someone who has a diverse range of skills and experiences honed over a 20+ year career that includes B2B SaaS startup experience (with a successful exit), an obsession with growing revenue through customer service via ‘value enhancement’ tactics, a stint in the cannabis industry, a leadership style that values employee engagement and growth, cross-functional consensus building, and a relentless focus on ‘The Team… The Team… The Team’, let’s talk.And for anyone reading this that is in a similar situation and wants to just chat/vent/share recipes (I make a great French Toast; spoiler alert: orange zest is the secret ingredient); whatever you want to talk about, feel free to reach out to me for some straight up networking. I will do my best to provide any advice and/or intros to anyone in my network.#opentowork #opentonewconnections #networking #jobseeker #layoffs #community

I don't really have words to express what I feel when I login to LinkedIn the last few days. On one hand it's heartbreaking for all of those impacted by layoffs and on the other it's heartwarming to see the way people are reacting with empathy, concern, care and ultimately human kindness to help those impacted. We need to all pull together and help how we can.I don't have much to add because all the words of wisdom have been said by those much smarter than I. But if you have been impacted please know, you have an army of people looking out for you and ready to help. In a small way, we here at Activision are ready to help with our Talent Bridge Series. We will be hosting a series of virtual career fairs as a  format to hear from business and recruiting leaders about opportunities at Activision and our studios. The first event is this Friday November 11th from 12-1 PT and will feature Daniel Nelson CTO of Infinity Ward.

#hotnewtrend 🙈( This is not about the people who have lost their jobs but the desire to make a difference vs plat on a trend ) Many VC firms are launching new funds for people laid of. Just a few questions :1. Why ? What’s the investment thesis here ?  I am assuming a VC firm has a fiduciary responsibility to invest based on an investment thesis rather than a sentiment or good PR ?that the people laid of are better at building Businesses Then others were not Let off or or others who Chose not to take a job  I am focused on entrepreneurship by choice 2. If the aim is to help these people and help the fund too -wouldn’t it be better to place these people in the funds own firms at decent salaries  Or get them on projects for same firms. 2 million will impact more people & And ensure the existing firms have  a better chance of succeeding than just 20 companies or around 40 people.3. The good ones will anyway raise funding by the need for a separate fund?4. And yet if there was still a desire to help them out in actual  Entrepreneurship And do it separately than the  existing method then why not start an incubation programme where they can meet like-minded people and the idea can go through a vetting process like the  antler programs🧠Just wondering especially in an environment where where less and less decisions of VCs seemed to have turned out that well and we want more companies and individuals to succeed. #entrepreneurship #pr #funding #job #investment Day One Ventures #environment #building #venturecapital #layoffs
