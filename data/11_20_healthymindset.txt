It's about who you are becoming in the process of getting to your results.The mindset you take on.The actions you take to get there.I was burnt out.Husle mode 24/7.Not living my life to the fullest.I felt out of alignment.And i didn't know how to guide my soul to the next level.üëâ  Past traumas, wounds, low engery, being out of alignment, and being someone who I AM NOT, were all the reasons for holding my potential back.ü¶ã  Until i figure out how important inner work is. üî•  Mindset does play a huge role in your business, work, how you treat your family, and most importantly how you treat yourself.‚ú®  Inner work is the biggest part of creating a healthy sustainable lifestyle.Drop a ‚ù§ if you felt this post!P.S.

Affirmations are a proven and powerful way to help you manage your mind, have a healthy mindset, and achieve your goals. A lot of people think that affirmations are just a bunch of words you say to yourself and then forget about them. But they‚Äôre so much more than that. They‚Äôre actually a form of self-hypnosis that helps your subconscious mind accept what you want in life‚Äîand actually make it happen. Affirmations can be used for a variety of things, including:‚ö°Ô∏èImproving your self-confidence and self-esteem‚ö°Ô∏èStrengthening your relationships with others‚ö°Ô∏èManaging stress in your life Affirmations are a great way to get your mind in the right place. They can help you change your life, even if it feels like nothing is changing. If you‚Äôre not sure where to start with affirmations, here are some examples of positive affirmations: ‚ö°Ô∏èI am in control of my mind. ‚ö°Ô∏èChaos does not become me. ‚ö°Ô∏èI possess the ability to go beyond the expectations I have set for myself. ‚ö°Ô∏èMy path to solutions is limitless. ‚ö°Ô∏èI am able to overcome any obstacle that comes my way.I use affirmations daily and have seen a huge difference in my life. I‚Äôm happier, more confident, and less stressed out. If you‚Äôre ready to make some positive changes in your life, try using affirmations for yourself.So today, I decided to share some affirmations I wrote for my biz bestie recently when her thoughts were exhibiting chaos. I hope you enjoy them and feel free to use them yourself!If these resonate with you, I'd love it if you'd share them with your biz bestie or anyone else who may need to hear these words today.#mindsetcoaching #entrepreneurship #healthymindset #affirmationsoftheday #contentmarketing #contentstrategy #mindsetforsuccess

Boost Brainpower Try the Pushup TestMen who can do 40 or more pushups and women who can do 16-20 or more pushups are 96 percent less likely to experience a cardiovascular event than those who can only do a few.You're done if you have to stop and rest or put a knee down.¬†Just crank out as many true pushups as you canIf you're a man and can do 40, or women, 16 to 20, that's awesome (You are an outlier if you can do it.)Tests like these aren‚Äôt perfect.

A very powerful and thought provoking statement I read today which relates to my life and might have helped me in more than 1 way. Patrick Bet-David is someone who I have followed for over 7-8 years now. In my dark times a few years ago, I asked his help on Instagram to guide me through my downs of Entrepreneurial journey and somehow he read, replied and guided me over a few months. I feel lucky to have such people helping in my journey over the years and I call them my mentors even though they wont fit the regular mentorship model but I got to learn so much from them directly or indirectly. If you feel helpless at any point in your life, ask for help. I can assure you that universe has a way to provide it to you in ways you can't think. Healthy Mind makes a healthy life..I wrote this post in hope it can bring someone some support, so share it with someone who may need it..

Someone recently referred to me as a ‚ÄúHeart Doctor.‚Äù Not in the medical, cardiologist type doctor, but a healer of hearts. I reflected on this and thought, this is exactly what I do! I help heal your broken heart. üíî Your damaged heart. üíî Your guarded heart.üíî Everything heart related, whether you know how to access it or not. If you‚Äôve experienced trauma, heartbreak, or don‚Äôt even know how to feel emotion because you have so many walls around your heart, I‚Äôm your gal. I know what that feels like. To grow up not knowing how to feel or how to even allow anyone into your heart. To then open your heart and have it trampled on by someone you trust. To be blind sighted and experience total assault of the heart. My heart has been through it all and I‚Äôm standing on the other side with a repaired heart because I did the work. It doesn‚Äôt have to be painful, but it does require addressing some of the things that your heart has experienced. ‚ù§Ô∏è Let me help you knit your heart back together.‚ù§Ô∏è Figure out the right kind of walls to have up around your heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è And ultimately, go on a journey with you to heal your heart.

A Fun Way to Test your StrengthIt‚Äôs no surprise that greater muscle strength means greater health. But how do you measure that? A 2018 study found handgrip strength to be a proxy for measuring overall body strength and muscle mass.You could test your grip strength using a dynamometer. I don‚Äôt have one of those, so a suggested substitute is hanging from a pull-up bar for as long as possible.Thirty seconds for women and 60 seconds for men is a good target.Grip strength is a good bio-marker because it reflects the overall condition of your skeletal muscles.You can use one of these squeeze trainers to improve your grip strength or just hang from a pull-up bar.I‚Äôve had a daily exercise regimen since I retired from corporate life. I haven‚Äôt missed a day in over eight years. I love being in my mid-sixties and feeling strong and energetic. And I love challenges like this to see if I can keep improving.To learn how to thrive in your third chapter of life and be a role model of well-being.

Yesterday I was reminded of a famous quote by Albert Einstein. He defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.I realized that I was doing the same thing over and over again for years in my relationship with food. I would get on the scale hopeful that it would tell me that I was a good person only to get upset with the number either not moving down fast enough or, heaven forbid, that it went up by 100 grams!! Then I would get back on my diet and obsess about every single crumb that passed through my lips, every drop of sweat getting me closer to my "goal weight".Despite all this energy spent on dieting and exercise, binge eating was just a Tim Tam away from getting me back into my insanity loop. I wish I didn't have to say this but...Diets are the #1 cause of eating disorders, yet society still promotes it, like it's the only way to live. We get sucked into the belief that dieting is the answer, that our bodies are unworthy the way they are, & that we need to be thin to be healthy and happy If dieting actually worked then 95% of dieters would not have gained the weight back, in fact, these dieters gained back more weight than before the diet Dieting promotes unhealthy weight loss through highly restrictive eating and exercise plans, It lures you in with empty promises like ‚òÄÔ∏è lose 10kg in 4 weeks‚òÄÔ∏è 7 Day lose 20lb ‚òÄÔ∏è intermittent fasting‚òÄÔ∏è 10-day rapid weight loss cleanse .....It seems like a dream come true, so we fall for it, but our metabolism slows down which means you have to eat even less to see results on the scale. Our results are short-lived because eventually we can't ignore the nagging food zombie nagging in our ears and we find ourselves in a binge coma. We go back to google and find the next best diet preaching even more restrictions and we start the process all over again. As someone who has battled with my eating for almost my entire life, along with many, many others, I know how damaging this cycle can be.

Do you ever feel this way?üí¢ Busy, but nothing gets doneüí¢ Tired, but sleep isn't helping üí¢ Anxious but you don't know whyOften times we get overwhelmed with so many different things in life, and we aren't sure what to do to help.   Neurofeedback ia a great tool to assist with all if these things and more.  The Neurofeedback system is mathematically formulated to read the electrical activity of the brain, communicating to the brain and Central Nervous System,  notifying the brain when it starts to go off path.  The brain will self correct and come back to "real time", continuing in the pattern it was originally on.  By self correcting over and over,  it helps our minds to feel calm,  rejuvenated, more focused and less stress, and assisting with managing our anxiety and mental health.  Neurofeedback has helped many to train their brains and manage their mental mindset.  Neurofeedback is a game changer to a healthier lifestyle.   #NeurOptimal¬Æ #Neurofeedback #parkerneurofeedback #calmmind #bettersleep #lessstress #manageanxiety #betterfocus #healthymindset #mentalhealthhelp

It sounds like some kind of Halloween spookiness that the head would be separated from the body. When talking about health, why do we so often differentiate between physical and mental wellbeing? We are adamant that both are interconnected and equally as important. In this video we discuss a few ways that you can care for your physical and mental health simultaneously. #mentalhealth #mentalwellbeing #healthymindset #support #performance

Do you know that a physically fit healthy body tends to increases the proportion of endorphins in our mind by reducing body-induced mental stresses. Endorphins are considered as ‚Äúfeeling good‚Äù chemicals that are released by our brain to make us feel positive and jolly. Thus, a healthy body leads to a healthy mind.#transformwithvindeep and change your lifestyle by improving your way of eating. #healthylifestyle #healthyfood #healthyeatinghabits #physicalfitness #fitnessmotivation #positivemindset #healthymindset

Today I listened to a podcast about the abundence mindset and how to get the most out of the time in our days. They mentioned how habit stacking not only increases the amount of things we can get done in a day, but also helps incorporate new and healthy habits. Habitat stacking can be drinking water daily, but adding lemon to it to get more vitamins in. Being able to check off tasks throughout your days, big or small, can significantly increase your productivity and even boost your mood! My goal is to habit stack 3 new things to my daily routine.  #productivity #habitsforsuccess #healthymindset #betterlife

If we can shift our mindset to focus on who we want to become, the identity we are striving for vs. fixating on the goals we think will solve our problem, we will be more connected to our future self and the habits we instill to get there.¬†At the root of habit & behavior change is our identity, who we believe we are, who we have been in our past and who we want to be in our future. If we allow this identity and this desire to guide us, we will reach that identity much sooner & smoother than if we are consistently setting ourselves up for disappointment with unrealistic goals.¬†Save this post for when you need a refresh!

Morning!!!We should be building up self resilience in a world that is filled with a lot of noise. We chat to the brilliant filmmaker Salomon on just that. How he leads his family to good values and strong mental stance.There‚Äôs a lot of situations that are out of control at the moment in the world. We need to focus on building our own strength for continued growth and happiness.Salomon, a son to missionary parents who opened his eyes to the world, is a self-taught filmmaker whose international background‚Äì‚Äì‚Äìa childhood spent in Johannesburg‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì , Dubai, and Sydney‚Äì‚Äì‚Äìfigures strongly in his distinctive, visceral yet meditative work. His textural and experimental style tries to find new ways of exploring visual and narrative storytelling - always with a human story at its core.His work has garnered recognition across the world, with inclusion in both the Saatchi & Saatchi and 1.4 New Directors Showcases, two Golds and three Silvers at the YDAs, a Gold Cannes Lion, multiple AICP wins with work featured at the MOMA, shortlists for Music Video of the Year at Shots, Best Alternative Video and Best New Director at the UKMVA‚Äôs - and a growing list of awards from the industry including the British Arrows, Cannes D&AD.These honors are all the more extraordinary for a young director ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì , who is just a couple of years into his commercial film career. His body of work includes short films like ‚ÄúRocket Wars,‚Äù which documents the stunning aerial fireworks battle of a Greek village, as well as commercials for Puma, Adidas, Top Boy, S7, Valvoline etc, and music videos for artists like Justin Bieber, Giveon, Little Simz, Skrillex, Don Toliver, Prince, The Weeknd, Daughter, Bearcubs and Young Fathers.Salomon currently lives in New York City with his young family, where he is in the early stages of putting together his debut feature, MOTHERLAND ¬†and writing his second, ICONOCLAST.IG @salomonligthelm #mentalwellness #mentalhealth #mentalwellbeing #bemindful #meditation #thepowerofnow #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmotivation #selfcare #selfhelppodcast #selfhelp #highvibes #healthymindset #manifestation #positiveintentions #positiveliving #raiseyourvibration #inclusion #film #writing #music #work #storytelling #career #happiness #growth #dubai #like #video #building #sydney

Even if you have a busy morning, you can still eat a healthy breakfast. Here are some tips for doing so:1. Plan ahead. Make sure you have all the ingredients for a tasty and healthy breakfast and eat at home, rather than buying junk food on the run or skipping breakfast altogether.2. Eat slowly. Pay attention to what you are eating. This gives your body time to digest the food and absorb the nutrients before you start rushing again.3. Spend a few moments appreciating your life and connecting with gratitude.#joyfulliving #gratefullness #gratitudejournal #relationshipanxiety #health #mentalhealth #holistichealth #storyteller #storiesmatter #wellnesscoach #holisticwellness #bemindful #planbefore #eatslowly #beactive #healthymindset #mindsetmatters #wellseekers #lucianazzaro

I know how it feels to ride the entrepreneurial highs and lows, with and without support. If you are going through a period in your life where you have doubts, don‚Äôt give up. You need to keep in mind that you are not alone in this. We all go through stuff like that. All business owners sometimes have doubts, or experience some type of failure. That is fine ‚Äì we just calmly persist. I'm going to tell you the secret to moving forward. It's you. You are your greatest asset. If you begin to acknowledge that you can do whatever your mind tells you, you will have the power to unleash the potential that has been hiding inside you for a very long time.However, you also have to be realistic and be yourself. Whatever your version of success is, challenge yourself and pursue it. Be kind to yourself and just do it.Small steps will lead you to where you want to go and who you want to be. Here are five of my top tips to support you to move from being a secretly struggling entrepreneur to taking bigger, bolder steps that move your business forward with confidence.Read the full blog here. https://bit.ly/3RTRvEK#thegoalsguy #WorkLifeBalance #HealthyMindset #workoptionallifestyle #AchieveYourGoals #EntrepreneurLife #FinanceCoach #SuccessMotivation #SuccessfulPeople #SuccessTips

I published my book in 2020 with three main motivations in mind:- To give people hope that you can recover from something horrific and traumatic- To show the devil that he hasn‚Äôt won in his attempt to take me out- To prove to myself that I can overcome anything, including the scary reality that my story would now be available for the world to readI never imagined people other than family and friends would read my book. I certainly didn‚Äôt imagine someone in another country downloading my book. But it happened. I got paid royalties for ebooks sold in Australia. Not one ebook. Multiple ebooks!I‚Äôm speechless. Humbled. Grateful. And honored that someone found my book and wanted to read my story. And I hope that it accomplished my overall goal in publishing my book.

Have we ever wondered why we get stuck with a negative thought for a long time?Our body is created with optimal bias where we are inclined to see more of the positives, there may be so many good things that would have happened throughout the day .On the other side, we are focused and obsessed of the negative criticism or comment leading to a unexpected toxic stuff that catches our attention causing imbalance.We always seek balance its with the same mechanism we keep thinking about the negative thought on why we got labelled, what made them to criticize us that way, how and what we can do it to cope up with it and same thought goes on and on, it gets rewired in the brain and becomes a pattern or an toxic thought leading to a meaning and thereby an unresourceful frame of mind.These thoughts make us think more and more about the same situation going around the same emotions in a spiral manner.A.What is wrong?B.How it can be rectified?C.how frustrated this could be?D. How could they do that?The sooner we acknowledge the better, as we know where focus goes energy flows it expands into reality if it is being focussed too long.Human minds takes longer time to shift from loss to gain .This is the exact same pattern we saw in pandemic, though its been a year, we constantly keep saying about those consequences ,the losses thereby delaying our outcomes.Before this focus could impact the physiology its important to ask certain questions to overcome these negative thoughts.Questions to deal with negative thoughts.1.What can I do to make this circumstance easier to handle?2.Have I ever encountered something similar before? 3.What have I discovered from my past experiences that might be useful today?4.What did I think about when I felt this way in the past that made me feel better?5.What could possibly go wrong?6.What scenario is most likely to occur?7.What would I be able to do to survive if the worst occurred?8.What results from thinking in this manner?9.Will this perspective enable me to solve the issue? 10.Would a different angle be more beneficial?When you can see things from a bigger picture, things usually don't seem as daunting, your mind calms down, and you may start to see things more clearly once you are able to have a wider perspective. Clarity will allow you to identify practical solutions for whatever is bothering you.In order to get your thoughts out of your brain and slow down your mind, it is frequently helpful to actually write out your replies to these questions. Additionally, having the answers in front of you in writing might help them stick in your memory and appear more real than if they were just additional thoughts added to what was already running through your head.#negativethoughts #negativeemotions #emotionalintelligence #emotionalwellbeing #questionsworthasking #memories #frames #thoughtfortheday #healthymindset #awareness #selfregulation

So what is YOUR biography?From 1-10 what rating would you give your health and happiness, if 10 meant  amazing health and extremely happy and 1 would be poor health and an unhappy state.Did you know that your beliefs and emotional state have a direct effect on your health?For instance:Are you a jealous person?Are you an angry person, always feeling that life is chaotic and just not fair?Is it a challenge for you to ‚Äújust go with the flow‚Äù?Do you have loved ones that you haven‚Äôt spoken to in years?Do you hate your job?Do you feel guilt or shame about something?Are you someone that has dealt with any kind of abuse, and never fully healed from it?Do you suffer from anxiety?These types of scenarios left to fester inside your body, will absolutely create pain, inflammation, and even disease. If you are currently sick or dealing with pain, it would be wise to look at any fears, insecurities, unresolved situations, that you have been avoiding.If you want to be a healthier person and experience your best life, you MUST make the appropriate mindset changes along with changing diet and exercise.#mindset #intuitivecoach #healthcoach #healthymindset #liveyourbestlife #emotionalhealth #mentalhealth #anxiety #depression #stress #painrelief #weightloss #thyroidhealth

ü•ÄSuicide is the act of intentionally ending one's own life. It is often associated with mental health and can be caused by a variety of factors. The rates of suicide have been on the rise for the past few decades, especially among young people. When life becomes too much to bear, both emotionally and physically, it's common to think about ending it. Allowing a suicidal person to express his or her thoughts can help relieve depression and pent-up negative emotions, and may prevent suicide.‚úÖKnowing the signs of depression is the starting point for getting your loved ones the help they need. It‚Äôs important to identify warning signs of mental health struggles and offer support. Reach out to check on your family members, friends, and colleagues who may be exhibiting some of the signs and symptoms.üëÜüèº If you or someone you know has depressing thoughts or feelings.

This has always been my motto. It is incredibly important to feel the hurt, disappointment, etc, when things don't go your way.  But when you live in that state and don't work towards healing or solutions for the future, that is when you become stuck. When you become stuck in feeling sorry for yourself mode for extended periods, it will actually create stress on the body.  Can you guess what comes up next?  Chronic conditions like high blood pressure, pain, anxiety, depression, etc, if you don't already have it.  If you do, these conditions will become worse. None of it will be able to be explained. That's why it is important when things hit us, we need to take a little time to reflect and understand our feelings about the situation.  But then once you do, you need to take action and work towards healing. What would you say is your motto?#chronicpainwarrior #mindsetmatters #mentalhealthjourney #happylife #healthymindset

Yesterday, I submitted my last student loan payment. True story, I almost cried, and then I spent some time reflecting.¬†#studentloans are a massive conversation right now, especially state side. Here is what I learned over the past 10-11 years of paying off these #debts:- It‚Äôs crazy #overwhelming, and for a long time, I just shut down. Bare minimum payments, bare minimum traction.¬†- It took a loving, supportive partner to help me stomach and step-up tackling the overwhelm. I am deeply #grateful for him.¬†- Our financial #educationsystem could use some work (and that‚Äôs putting it lightly). Financial literacy is key to a #healthymindset and financial stability. Paying off any debt is insanely #empowering.¬†- The student loan conversation is important. I think straight forgiveness will help many but isn‚Äôt a full proof plan to tackle educational costs or a financial understanding of what it means to enter into any loan, especially at 18. We need to open this conversation to the many facets that have brought us to this point.¬†- I recognize and am grateful for my ability to have paid these debts off. Yes I work hard, but as these past few years have taught us, nothing is promised - your health, economic stability, jobs, etc‚Ä¶So there is a bit of luck in all of this.¬†To all my #LinkedIn homies still going through any #debtmanagement, my hat is off to you.

Read biographies, and you‚Äôll find that people's success is often the product of overcoming misfortunes in life. They take what was offered, make the most of it, surmount the adversities, and give back to impact others.Now, think about your life.Do you complain about your genes, your family, or your education? For every complaint, there may be someone out there who had it harder to begin with, yet they thrive nonetheless.¬†üíØStart with where you are now, accept the reality of what you have, then use the resources life has given you to create something marvelous.There are no rules to limit what you can achieve.

Let‚Äôs talk about stress?¬†Dealing with stress should be done gently. All physical, emotional and psychological factors are accompanied with biochemical reactions in the body, it reminds us that the body is constantly communicating with our cells.Often prescribed medication is required and it really shouldn‚Äôt be discredited but let‚Äôs look at holistic ways we can reduce stress.There is no right or wrong way, and what helps one person will not be the same to another. It‚Äôs about allowing oneself to use their own guidance to know what works for them.Here are some suggestions;Remove all high processed foods from your dietEat slowly in a calm environmentKeep coffee to a minimum (2 cups a day)Stay hydrated - 2 litres a dayGet out into nature everydayGet to bed by 10.00 pmMeditateDo something you enjoy eg: movies or dancingSpend less amount on Social MediaDo something you have been procrastinating aboutKeep your work and living space tidyTry natural herbal medicine and essential oilshttps://linktr.ee/emmabitz¬†#stressfree¬†#holistichealth¬†#makechanges¬†#healthyeating¬†#mentalhealthawareness¬†#healthymindset¬†#meditatedaily¬†#selfcare

Back from a 4 day solo canoe adventure in Manitoba‚Äôs backcountry - a trip that I almost cancelled. This is my fourth year of going on a trip alone to somewhere remote and wild, and because of the sheer busyness of this season I contemplated cancelling.Despite the busyness, the cold, the snow, etc‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt willing to sacrifice this trip and instead chose to uphold my committment to dedicating self-care time - even though it means time away from work and family.  I have prioritized myself and pursing my passions, while at the same time being immersed in an environment that allows me to disconnect, self reflect and recharge.  A space that challenges and exercises my mental and physical abilities.  This is indeed my Disney Land, and Mother Nature is my Therapist. I bring this up because being ‚Äúselfish‚Äù often carry‚Äôs negative connotations, when it isn‚Äôt always a bad thing. The key is surrounding yourself with people who support you, both at work and at home. This self-care time is likely different for everyone, whether spent alone or with others, it is whatever allows you to heal, grow and start living a more purposeful life.  So my question to you, when‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôve been ‚Äúselfish‚Äù? Life is short, no time like the present‚Ä¶.#selfcare #metime #rechargeyourself #selfreflection #healthymindset

Many people ask the question..."Can Neurofeedback help with Trauma?"People with trauma or PTSD often wonder why they can‚Äôt move on from past events, even if they happened years ago. Through talk therapy, they may come to understand that they are no longer in danger, yet may continue to experience heightened anxiety, panic, flashbacks and nightmares.This is because trauma affects more than just our thoughts. Trauma changes the brain and body in ways that talking and reasoning may not be able to reverse. Healing from trauma requires healing the brain and body‚Äôs biology, not just our thoughts.Neurofeedback is one of the new promising, evidence-based tools that can help address the deeper, underlying biological changes that result from trauma and PTSD. NeurOptimal¬Æ Neurofeedback is a non-invasive,  natural way of training our brains to have healthier patterns and a healthier mindset.   #NeurOptimal¬Æ #Neurofeedback #parkerneurofeedback #neurofeedbackandtrauma #neurofeedbackandptsd #healingfromtrauma #braintraining #resilientbrain #healthymindset #mentalhealthmatters

When you have low thyroid function, you make more thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Your thyroid is controlled by a gland in your brain, called the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland makes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH tells your thyroid how much thyroid hormone it needs to make.If the thyroid hormone levels in your blood are too low, your pituitary gland makes larger amounts of TSH to tell your thyroid to work harder. If your thyroid hormone levels are too high, the pituitary gland makes little or no TSH. By measuring TSH levels in your blood, you can find out if your thyroid is making the right level of hormones.In order to get the full picture of what‚Äôs going on, it is always a good idea to get a full thyroid hormone panel including TSH, free T3, free T4, reverse T3, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies.

Can I tell you a secret?I don't have a step-by-step morning routine that I follow religiously every. single. morningI use toBut then every morning I didn't stick 100% to it, I would get frustrated and overwhelmedFrustrated with myself because hi my name is Lauren and I'm a recovering perfectionistI thought I had to have this elaborate and perfect morning routine and that I had to stick to it every. single. morningI felt overwhelmed if I didn't, thinking well there goes my whole day out the door (honestly that's how it felt üôà)Until one morning I gave myself permission to do what I wanted to do that day (not what I did yesterday or what worked for me last week but that day)I noticed how much more grounded, calm and excited I was for my daySo the next day, I did the sameI realized it was more valuable and transformational for me to start my day how I wanted, rather than hold myself to this strict morning routineBecause here's the thing, life happens and the more you can flow with it rather than against it, that's where the true magic lies ‚ú®Maybe you dreamt of being your own boss one day, now you are but you're still trying to stick in this 9-5 schedule you once had or feel bound to because "that's what everyone else is doing"I get it, I use to tooInstead of prioritizing checking everything off your morning routine every. single. morning, honor yourself each new day and decide what is going to best support youStart your day asking yourself: "what is going to help me align with and step into my fullest potential and the next level version of myself, today?"When you start trusting and believing in that your success is inevitable, you can let go of that pressure to be "on" it all the time and to work around the clock...#selfhealingjourney #soulwork #beyourbestself #futureself #healingjourney #theuniversehasyourback #theuniversehasyourback #beyourbestyou #freeyourself #becomeabetteryou #trustyourintuition #healthymindset #selfempowerment #wellnesswarriors #limitingbeliefs #gracenotperfection #positivethought #selfheal #healingvibrations #selfgrowthjourney #mindsetcoaching #lifecoachingtips #confidencecoach #empoweringothers #positiveintentions #InspiredAction #livewithintention#worthiness#embracechange#mindsetshift

In your field ... do you find it difficult listening to a narcissist or a workplace bully go on social media to talk about how they are an expert in workplace bullying or narc-abuse? Many of them do that to cover their trail of damage in their wake. October is domestic violence awareness month, but workplace violence can be just as damaging. Particularly in a place that is prone to turn the ever charming narcissists into its leaders. The one thing left out of our college education (I think in most fields) is how to get along, or survive, or manage ~ work place bullies. The conversations come close, but they don't address it head on. When the 'fearless leader' also happened to abuse dogs in order to publish their expert findings, that person didn't think twice about inflicting harm on others for his own gain. Now, he can make or break careers. For example. I have a hard time with social media .... scars are not yet silver. So I tend to try it, then back away, then try again. We all have vulnerabilities. We all have things to work on. We all have resources to turn to in order to help us navigate the landscape. Dr. Ramani is one of my favorite go-to experts. #traumahealing #healthymindset # #socialmedia #leaders #workculture #postpandemicgrowth https://lnkd.in/gmSb9Rha

üéÉ Millions of kids will dress up in costumes and masks today. They will pretend to be someone else for a few hours of fun.¬†¬†Every other day, too many youths feel like they need to be someone else or hide beneath a mask of unhealthy body image standards.¬†¬†Body image dissatisfaction is a leading cause of anxiety disorders among American teens, according to the National Institute of Health.¬†¬†‚ÄúAdolescents may be especially susceptible to experiencing anxiety in response to body dissatisfaction and sociocultural pressures about physical appearance ideals. The pressure to conform to sociocultural ideals and engage in social comparisons with peers is of central importance during this developmental period, making negative appearance-based evaluations especially salient.‚Äù¬†Help steer conversations away from unhealthy body image expectations with the kids in your life.¬†¬†Here are three things you can teach them (and do for yourself!) to help them improve body image.¬†¬†Body image dissatisfaction is scary stuff!

[WELLNESS WEDNESDAY]Take care of your health and wellness!

Ask yourself these questions to check your status:
- have you had enough sleep?
- do you eat enough healthy food?
- have you drunk enough water?
- how do you feel?

It is important to always check your health and wellness because if these are neglected, all else will dysfunction. Always be conscious about the pillars of wellness: exercise, food, sleep and mental health. 

Health is wealth! It is never too late to start living well! Live well and healthy!

üó£Ô∏è October is Mental Health Awareness month!Honestly, these days... If you are NOT thinking about the mental health of your staff, then you're missing a valuable opportunity as a leader. It's easy to get sidetracked and think that it's up to others to manage and maintain a healthy mindset in the workplace. But as leaders...There is so much that we can do to support the well being of our teams: ‚úÖ Make mental health visible ‚úÖ Train for spotting early signs of mental health struggles‚úÖ Recognize team members' needs‚úÖ Ongoing support systems‚úÖ Help create boundaries & a culture of check-InsMake time for Mental Health Awareness in the workplace. #MentalHealthAwareness#WorkLifeBalance#HealthyMindset#LinkedInTopVoices

Many of us become self-centered with our needs and hyper-focused on why our own needs aren't being met without realizing what someone else's needs are being impacted by.  I could be worrying about trivial things while someone else is facing a life-or-death decision.  Many times this is a knee jerk impulsive reaction The key is the longer we complain about what our unmet needs are the more they just sit there.  So might as well give yourself a little bit of time in the day to be upset about your unmet needs and vent about it if you need to.  Then, when ready, tell yourself you're done with having unmet needs for today, get up off the complaint pedestal, and strive to take care of your unmet needs so you'll make room in your life to fulfill someone else's life with extra kindness because they need the extra compassion and appreciation#leadershipdevelopment #leadershipcoaching #leadershipmindset #compassionateleadership #culturebuilding #healthyrelationships #healthymindset #kindness

The Toxicity of Hustle CultureüéØ Who doesn't knows about the Hustle Culture? If you don't and I was to explain it in a few words, it's pushing yourself above your limits, and removing intrusion to achieve a goal,Pushing yourself to the hardest.And after that goal is achieved, wash rinse, and repeat.¬†¬†It may look pretty in a Bollywood movie or a motivational quote " Push yourself" Work the hardest as life is a race" etc.But often times we work ourselves to the bone, attach our self-worth to success, and punish ourselves if we do not succeed¬†Pushing ourselves more to the brink of snapping.¬†News flash that's not good. it is good to set a goal work hard for it and aim for success but it should not be at the expense of our other needs. We, humans, are social beings. if we cut the cord of meaningful interactions with people and see them as meaningless distractions it's only going to hurt us.¬†Don't get me wrong trying your hardest is not wrong but it's wrong if it glamorizes workaholism.It's not healthy to brag about working ourselves to death.It's better to have a healthy work-life balance, not solely focusing on work and having relations with people around you.Having a relaxed work-life balance actually increases productivity. It's okay to stand still for a while and not do anything.#worklifebalance #healthylifestyle #healthymindset #hustleculture #achieve #productivity #success #work

A heavy emotion, on the other hand, maybe alerting you to something.But before you can decipher what it is alerting you to, first take some deep breaths and ‚Äòstay‚Äô with it for a few minutes, until you calm down your nervous system.Then, take a pause and consider:- Why is it here?- What is it for?- What do I need to pay attention to?- Is there any action I should take?Do you struggle with embracing your emotions?

Conversation with the Ascended Masters Me: So why are we here?Answer: To continue learning and developing. For soul expansion. It takes many lifetimes to learn the lessons you chose for yourself.Excerpt from AWAKEN TO YOUR TRUTH"The understanding of why you're in physicality will allow you to alter your perception of the challenges that are presented to you.You are a soul using your body to experience in order to learn, grow, and develop your soul. You have incarnated for soul expansion.With every obstacle there is an opportunity to learn. The greater the challenge the greater your growth.Surrender to what is with gratitude and forgiveness. Be at peace to be in alignment with your soul.Trust and know you are never alone always loved, supported and guided by your divine team of angels and guides.Move forward with confidence. Clarity will come. You are awakening to your divine truth to live in peace and harmony with all around you.

I just love the confidence Clairemarie has now that she‚Äôs fought and contended for a healthy body and lifestyle‚Ä¶‚Äú The picture on the left popped up in my memories.  Over a decade ago, this picture was posted on someone else‚Äôs Facebook page, because there is NO way I would have posted it.  My mantra was never, EVER, get caught in a picture sideways.  This is a picture as close to my top weight of 400 pounds as I have ever found-I always avoided being in photos.  I was horrified, disgusted, and extremely ashamed when I saw this photo. But something made me post it. And while I cried tears for the old Clairemarie, I also appreciate her courage and willingness to keep trying to get healthy for her daughters, her family, and herself.  Thirteen years between these photos; and now I don‚Äôt mind standing sideways for pictures at all!üêõü¶ãüíú‚Äù #healthymindset #Optavia #grandma #fitover50 #healthyfamily  #weightlossgoals #weightlosscoach #healthylifestyle

There are many other routes to reach the destination you want to arrive at. A common misconception about reaching your goals is that as long as you set your goals, act on them, and keep working your ass off, you'll get it. WRONG. Sometimes, the results we want to see may not show up. It happens. When you encounter times like these, just keep on pivoting! Find new ways to get those opportunities and achieve those goals. How do you bounce back from not getting the opportunities you want? Share it in the comments.#goalsetting #goals #betteryourself #successmindset #healthymindset

We think. Therefore, we are conscious beings. But we are more than that‚Äîwe are also self-aware.To generate any kind of change, it is vital to becoming aware of various internal processes at each Aspect of Being. This includes body awareness, emotional awareness, metacognition, spiritual awareness, as well as taking conscious action.We can all practice deepening awareness on our own, while a life coach can definitely help the client find the blind spots and go even deeper.In each type of awareness, we define it in three levels: detection, acknowledgment, and fully embrace.Detection is a simple observation, the realization that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs there‚Äù ‚Äì such and such state, sensation, emotion, or thought.Acknowledgment means ‚Äòstaying with it for a little longer, welcoming these elusive phenomena, even if it appears displeasing initially.Full embrace welcomes whatever comes in life. Coaches help with this process of discovery by using a variety of tools, including meditation, emotional literacy exercises, thought-reframing, and constructive habit development.Want to learn more coaching skills?

Just as we are what we eat, I believe we are what we think. While we cannot ward off all illness or unpleasantness, we can create a healthy sense of well-being by choosing to create a more positive mindset that focuses on good health, vitality, and a more optimistic way of thinking.  Living with this intentionality helps us build resistance, resilience, and create new healthy habits that help us look and feel better from the inside out that increase our happiness quotient, life balance, and well-being.Try thisInitiate one activity  each day to brighten your mindset. It could be yoga, meditation, reading an inspiring quote, exercise, writing journal, or a combination of many thingsChoose a me-time activity each week that helps you revitalize and refresh your body and mind.  Is it  weekly chat with friends, reading, a hobby, getting outdoors--you decideWhat diet routine could you add or subtract from your diet that would help you look and feel better?Start & end each day with gratitude--write or say out loud three things you are grateful for each and every day.Stay healthy, and stay super awesome!Best,Jane#wellness #vitality #mysuoerawesomelife #creativity #reinvention #healthymindset #resiliance

Our experts Corina Erismann from @newlife.portugal and Josh Dickson from @resurfaceuk explain how retreats can help people suffering from depression.Originally known as ‚Äòmelancholia‚Äô and dubbed ‚Äòblack dog‚Äô by former UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, depression is an ever-increasing issue for our times.Maybe it‚Äôs the pandemic effect or the increasing cost of living, or perhaps we‚Äôve all raised our expectations, but it feels for many of us like life is letting us down. According to Corina Erismann, a clinical psychologist and counsellor at New Life Portugal, a member of our curated collection of retreats, the last few years have left us all asking some very deep questions about the meaning of life.‚ÄòDepression is becoming more prevalent, especially after Covid 19,‚Äô says Corina. ‚ÄòThe isolation, working from home and facing adversity, notably seeing our loved ones die or nearly die‚Ä¶this has made more people ask all the big ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô questions. They ask why they‚Äôre working so much, why they live in such a stressful place, and what‚Äôs really important in their lives.'Josh Dickson, a trauma therapist and clinical psychologist, who runs Resurface Retreats, adds: ‚ÄòDepressive triggers can include grief and loss, being rejected, illness, lack of sleep, trauma, money problems and stress. It‚Äôs important to note that depression results from the way we think about these events and is usually dominated by thoughts of being helpless or powerless.‚ÄôHead over to website to read the full article and browse some of the retreats that can help with depression. https://lnkd.in/dbkiZFSN#melancholy #queenofretreats #depression #covid19 #workingfromhome #lackofsleep #trauma #meaningoflife #purpose #therapy #wellbeingretreats #wellnessretreats #mentalhealth #healthymindset #mindfulness #winstonchurchill #stress #anxiety #selflove #griefretreat #sleepretreat #healingretreat #purposefulliving #bethankfuleveryday #thinkpostive #happinessisachoice #focusonthegood #changemaker #goodvibes #positivemindset

Yesterday I was reminded of a famous quote by Albert Einstein. He defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.I realized that I was doing the same thing over and over again for years in my relationship with food. I would get on the scale hopeful that it would tell me that I was a good person only to get upset with the number either not moving down fast enough or, heaven forbid, that it went up by 100 grams!! Then I would get back on my diet and obsess about every single crumb that passed through my lips, every drop of sweat getting me closer to my "goal weight".Despite all this energy spent on dieting and exercise, binge eating was just a Tim Tam away from getting me back into my insanity loop. I wish I didn't have to say this but...Diets are the #1 cause of eating disorders, yet society still promotes it, like it's the only way to live. We get sucked into the belief that dieting is the answer, that our bodies are unworthy the way they are, & that we need to be thin to be healthy and happy If dieting actually worked then 95% of dieters would not have gained the weight back, in fact, these dieters gained back more weight than before the diet Dieting promotes unhealthy weight loss through highly restrictive eating and exercise plans, It lures you in with empty promises like ‚òÄÔ∏è lose 10kg in 4 weeks‚òÄÔ∏è 7 Day lose 20lb ‚òÄÔ∏è intermittent fasting‚òÄÔ∏è 10-day rapid weight loss cleanse .....It seems like a dream come true, so we fall for it, but our metabolism slows down which means you have to eat even less to see results on the scale. Our results are short-lived because eventually we can't ignore the nagging food zombie nagging in our ears and we find ourselves in a binge coma. We go back to google and find the next best diet preaching even more restrictions and we start the process all over again. As someone who has battled with my eating for almost my entire life, along with many, many others, I know how damaging this cycle can be.

One of the biggest things I've learned since leaving my 15 year  #retail career is that I was terrible at creating boundaries. I was afraid to say "no" because I was fearful that I would- lose an opportunity- create conflict- be seen as selfishI learned at a young age that putting others‚Äô needs over my own kept me safe. This was the perfect environment for becoming a people-pleaser/over-giver. and it leads to burnout.It can feel scary to start articulating your needs and saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to the things that aren‚Äôt aligned.If this sounds like you, I'll be hosting a workshop in December, The Weekend Immersion, and would love for you to join. It's a $33 investment for deep healing and life perspective.We go deep into the reasons for burnout and how you can reclaim your emotional and physical energy in the workspace and relationships.

"LOSE 18 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS"This is what a very popular weight loss company has on their home page! Why would this be appealing to us? Does it seem healthy or reasonable to you? The diet industry has trained us to think this is okay. Meanwhile they are doing damage. The vast majority of people that are able to lose weight that quickly regain it just as quickly. It's a sham!The diet industry has created an artificial context that has led us to believe that we are broken, and we have to be fixed.

"Discipline now = freedom later"Imagine your health as your childhood.You spend years growing and wishing that you were older.Learning from the things you do right and wrong‚Ä¶Your parents show you the ropes‚Ä¶Praise you when you do well,Discipline you when you do wrong.How to act and what to do in certain moments‚Ä¶As a kid, you hate it‚Ä¶You can't grow up fast enough.Counting down the years until we can finally have a little independence and freedom.But then, all of a sudden, you are an adult.Things aren't all plain sailing‚Ä¶You have responsibilities, bills, a job and maybe even kids of your own now.No hand-holding through every scenario anymore.On top of all of the responsibilities, you also have to try to stay healthy.A demon that many of us struggle with‚Ä¶And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs my intention to make things a little simpler in that department.So how is your health like your childhood?You need to start from somewhere, fresh with no knowledge‚Ä¶Learning the rules, tricks and hacks as you go.You must stay disciplined in order to grow.Eventually, you get to where you are happy‚Ä¶Then you can enjoy the freedom of eating and doing what you like, in moderation‚Ä¶You now understand the consequences of what you do‚Ä¶And the response required in order to stay healthy.So think of me as your fitness parent‚Ä¶I can show you the ropes, just like when you were young.#discipline #freedom #stoic #quotestoliveby #mindsetshift #parenthood #healthymindset #growthmindset #bbcasiannetwork #sikhmuscle #theindianbodycoach #completehealthrewire

üí•  JACK'S 3RD WEEK CHECK IN üí• Jacks 3rd week check in guys and he is already 5kg/11lbs down! 3lbs to go until we reach 1 stone down. Well done buddy let's keep pushing and making those results. Jack works unsociable hours so doesn't get to train sometimes but as you can see we still make results regardless, his plan is specifically tailored around his needs. So the food on his plan is food he likes and enjoys eating. Jack is also allowed a cheat meal once a week where he can eat whatever and how much he wants in one sitting. Remember guys this change is a lifestyle change that has to realistically suit your needs to make it doable. This kind of lifestyle change has to involve training you enjoy and food you enjoy for you to be able to remain disciplined and motivated.‚ñ∂Ô∏è If you‚Äôd like results like these, drop me a message now with the word ‚ÄòRESULTS‚Äô and we can chat about you being part of our October intake of clients.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî#fitnessforlife #personaltrainerintraining #fitblogger #thefitlife #personalfitnesstrainer #coachingnutrition #healthymindset #nutritioncoaching #workoutinspo #onlinepersonaltraining #personaltrainerlife #weighttraining #healthyeating #trainingday #healthandfitness #LookGoodFitness #lookgoodfitnessltd #weightlossadvice

If you‚Äôre trying to lose weight, you need to do it the right way!You‚Äôve been told or at least think that you have to measure, weigh, and track food in order to lose weight. WRONG! You don‚Äôt. This creates a negative relationship with food which is only to your detriment.¬†Let‚Äôs debunk the common things you‚Äôve been told about losing weight and I‚Äôll tell you what you should be doing and what works!‚íà You don‚Äôt have to measure, weigh or keep track of your food in order to lose weight.¬†‚íâ You don‚Äôt have to weigh your food to know portion control. The key is being in tune with your hunger cues. If you are attuned to your hunger cues, there is no reason to weigh your food.¬†‚íä You don‚Äôt have to log your foods to know if you are in a caloric deficit. Food is fuel, you need fuel to get through your day. If you are feeling low energy, that‚Äôs a sign you are under eating.¬†‚íã Counting macros, carb cycling, or flex dieting isn‚Äôt necessary to lose weight. When you have a healthy relationship with food and don‚Äôt restrict yourself you will lose weight.¬†As parents we need to focus our energy on other things like‚Ä¶ not worrying about numbers associated with foods. With all you‚Äôre juggling as a parent, you don‚Äôt have time for that!Share this with at least one other person today you think would benefit.¬†#healthymindset #healthyfood #healthyfoodchoices #healthynutrition #healthynutritionchoices #foodforhealth #foodformindset

Are you getting 10,000 steps a day?Good for you. Science has confirmed that this is an indicator of overall health. But, the Universities of Sydney and Southern Denmark show that to get the most out of your steps, pick up the pace. A faster pace - like a power walk - showed benefits beyond the number of steps achieved.walking faster has beneficial associations for dementia, heart disease, and cancer.The study found that if you regularly walk briskly (like 3 to 4 miles per hour), you have a lower mortality risk. The benefits are even greater for those who are 60 or over.¬†So, keep walking and pick up your pace. It‚Äôs good for your body and your brain. There‚Äôs a definite link between fitness and improved memory, reasoning, sharpness, and judgment.¬†Track your pace and steps, and you will be amazed at how quickly you will see progress.To learn how to thrive in your third chapter of life and be a role model of well-being.

Stress is universal and it is definitely a creeper.Sometimes we don‚Äôt even recognise just how stressed we are and more importantly we don‚Äôt always realise the impact that stress is having on us. And of course, our reactions to stress are different according to mentalhealth.org ‚ÄúWe all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life events, personality and social and economic circumstances.‚Äù.As we are increasingly bombarded with scary headlines about all of these realities from every angle - the news, social media, documentary‚Äôs etc‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not surprising that we are feeling stressed out with covid anxiety and now climate change anxiety‚Ä¶so how do we go about managing our feelings?Sometimes it‚Äôs the little things that we do that make a difference so today on #StressAwarenessDay we‚Äôve shared a post on our website with some tips on what you can do to help manage your stress and anxiety‚Ä¶ we hope it‚Äôs helpful!https://lnkd.in/eGjavXNN?#stressawarenessday #reduceanxiety #stressmanagement #holistictherapist #wednesdaywellness #lookafteryourself #emotionalwellness #healthandwellbeing #wellnesswednesdays #wellbeingwednesday #wellbeingwarrior #wellnesswednesdaychallenge #wellnesswednesday #healthymindset #fillyourcup #findyourhappy #taketimeforyou #tipoftheday #wholistichealth #womeninbusiness

Have you heard of quiet quitting?Can you believe that 50% of our workforce are quiet quitters?¬†Quiet Quitting is not the answer. It seems almost counterintuitive but when you are feeling a lack of trust, communication, consistency, or value‚Ä¶ some of that is on you. Instead of ‚Äúquietly quitting‚Äù, it‚Äôs time to level up and find ùíÖùíäùíáùíáùíÜùíìùíÜùíèùíï ways to engage in your work.¬†1. Have direct, honest conversations with your supervisor about your workload, concerns, and suggestions.2. Set boundaries and don't say yes to everything.3. Be proactive in finding ways to engage in your work that work for you.4. Seek help if you're feeling burned out.¬†Burnout is a real thing. And in this day in age, I think we‚Äôre all more susceptible to it than we think. -You may fear retaliation or retribution if you speak up.-You may feel like you have no other choice but to quit quietly.-You may feel like you're the only one struggling or that no one else cares.-You may be afraid of rocking the boat or making waves.But, don‚Äôt quit quietly. Speak loudly - so that you ignite change.¬†#quietquitting #Propertymanagement #Propertymanagerlife #quietquittingyourjob #quietquittingadvice #levelup #levelupyourlife #worklifebalance #worklifebalancegoals #worklifebalancetips #lifecoachadvice #balancedlifestyle #balancedlifestyleliving #balancedlifehappylife #healthlyhabitsforlife #healthymindset #healthymindsets #healthymindsetgoals #balancecoach #productivity

What we put ON our bodies is just as important as what we put IN our bodies. It‚Äôs important to pay close attention to the ingredients in our skincare products. Our skin is the largest organ of our body and since it is porous, it absorbs whatever we put on it. If the products contain harmful ingredients such as harsh, toxic chemicals, colors, and fragrances, those ingredients make their way into our body, our blood, and our lymphatic system.It is important to read labels and learn about what ingredients to avoid.  A good motto to go by is if you can‚Äôt pronounce it, don‚Äôt use it üòâFor a few recommendations, head to my website and check out some ‚ÄúProducts I Recommend‚Äù  üíô ....#healthymindsethealthybody¬†#livingabundantly¬†#healthymindsetgoals¬†#functionalwellness¬†#mentalblock¬†#dealingwithanxiety¬†#mindbodyspirithealth¬†#emotionalhealthmatters¬†#personalfreedom¬†#healthythinking¬†#healyourmind¬†#mentalhealthwellness¬†#healthymindset¬†#growthmindset¬†#personaldevelopment¬†#mindsetshift¬†#mindsetmatters¬†#mindsetiseverything¬†#successmindset¬†#mindsetcoaching¬†#limitingbeliefs¬†#reframeyourthoughts¬†#personalgrowth¬†#mindsetiskey¬†‚Å†#growyourmindset¬†#positivepsychologycoach¬†#learningchallenges¬†#growthmindsetbelievers‚Å† #healthysoul¬†#mindhealth

Do you feel like this‚Ä¶You‚Äôre stressed all of the time? It may present itself as physical symptoms like:Back painTightness in our shouldersUpset stomachsDid you know that often stress comes with an emotion that needs to be acknowledged.Acknowledgment of the emotion can be critical to releasing the stress. Here is a great practice for seeing the emotion in your stress. Over the period of a week, whenever you feel stressed, write down the emotion that you are feeling. Do so without judgment, only acknowledge what the emotion is and see by the end of the week how you feel about your stress. Often we will see an opportunity to work on our response.What are your thoughts?#stressmanagement¬†#healthymindset #mindshift #personaldevelopment #balancedlife #stressmanagementtips #midlifehealth #mentalhealthrecovery #mentalresilience #holistichealth #selfawareness #midlifewoman

Happiness is a choice.  Sounds simple right?  In reality as we walk through our daily lives impacted by stress, frustration, resentment, jealousy, hatred, guilt, fear and depression...causing happiness to feel like an insurmountable hill to climb.The reality is, happiness takes practice.  It's easy to be fun loving when things are great, but making a choice of happiness when you're down takes conscious effort. What can you do?  The list is extensive, but my "go to" is clearing my mind of negative thoughts - especially historical baggage I drag around like and old box of junk from house-to-house.  Like that old box, you just need to let go.  Things like exercise, sleep and organizing your life are huge; but so is practicing compassion, love and empathy for others; surrounding yourself with likeminded people.#happiness #happinessisachoice #empathy #people #love #wellbeing #healthymindset #gavinheath #mindfulness

"Your mind's thoughts are disturbed by its fears." It's YOUR mind, so stop letting it guide you in its disturbed state. "You can watch the neurotic mind without getting involved."The Untethered Soul, Michael A. SingerPerfect love casts out fear. When you are afraid of change, love stronger intentionally."Peace is realizing that there's no possible way to prepare for the worst or the best, so we just live for the thanks. Be thankful for everything, not labeling anything as good or bad, but noticing it so that you can be grateful for its unraveling and the revealing of wisdom and abundance." (Soulbalm)I had to catch myself from listening to the mind trash. All is awareness, love and gratefulness in the present.

Living a healthy lifestyle we often focus on taking care of our bodies through exercise,  clean eating, and taking natural supplements to have better health and well-being.   But what about our minds?  How is our Mental Health?   What are we doing to train our brain to have a healthier mindset?One amazing tool that has been found to be very beneficial in training our brain, is Neurofeedback.  Neurofeedback is a non-invasive,  natural way of training our brain to have healthy patterns.  Sensors read the electrical activity of our brain, (like an EKG reads our heart), while listening to music that is mathematically formulated by NeurOptimal¬Æ to communicate through the NeurOptimal¬Æsystem, providing information to our Central Nervous System and our brain.  Little skips in the music alert our brain when it starts to go off track.  The brain recognizes this, self corrects and brings back to the present moment.  When the brain self corrects over and over,  it creates healthy patterns,  which helps to train our brains for a healthier mindset and a healthier lifestyle. HAVE YOU TRAINED YOUR BRAIN TODAY?üí•üí•üí•#NeurOptimal¬Æ #Neurofeedback #braintraining #mentalhealth #healthymindset #calmmind #betterfocus #balancedsleep #lessstress #manageanxiety #healthylifestle #mindmanagement #noninvasive #holistichealth

En dan opeens is het daar... een duidelijk antwoord op wat ik nu eigenlijk wil gaan doen in mijn leven. Ik wil geen middelmatig leven leiden, ik wil het grote voorbeeld zijn voor mijn kinderen en hen laten zien dat ze alles kunnen worden wie ze maar willen, als ze er maar durven voor gaan.Met heel veel plezier kan ik aankondigen dat ik een opleiding als Breakthrough Coach ben gestart bij Els Van Laecke. Want dat is wat ik wil gaan doen. Ik wil samen met mensen werken, niet meer met producten. Ik wil tot de kern doordringen van wie ze zijn en hen helpen in die zoektocht om hun beste versie te worden, of om hun business naar the next level te tillen. Want daar ligt mijn sterkte. Of het nu op gezondheidsvlak is, of mentaal vlak, of op businessvlak. Ik ga doorbraken behalen met alle personen met wie ik in zee ga.Wish me luck. Want dit is wat ik zal gaan doen. Op fulltime zelfstandige basis. And... I will succeed!#breakthrough #elsvanlaecke #coach #people #healthymindset #thisismyfuture #marketing #believeinyourself

Deepavali musings...What is the biggest challenge in your life?¬†Being resilient, aware in my mind, being my own cheerleader, counselor, in spite of all the lemons that the life throws at me, through the lows, hurdles and sad endings, onto greater, superior things and improved chapters.Mastering my mind is my biggest challenge.¬†¬†¬†What is your biggest challenge professionally?¬†It is hard to tell as every day comes with a new interesting challenge. Most challenging of challenges generally involve people. A human is the most complex and volatile of all living and non-living things, after all.¬†¬†Navigating through conflicts of interest, engaging and appealing to an opinionated audience, bringing together people with different perspectives, being a cheerleader in most difficult times are some of the biggest yet rewarding challenges at work.¬†¬†¬†Wishing everyone lots of love, light and prosperity on this Diwali, the festival celebrating victory of good over evil, light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance; and of accomplishments overcoming challenges!HAPPY DIWALI!#work¬†#life¬†#challenge¬†#mastering¬†#awareness¬†#healthymindset¬†#continuousimprovement¬†#continuouslearning¬†#musings¬†#midweekmotivation¬†#wednesdaywisdom¬†#diwali2022 #deepavali2022

I came across this article by #HBR on the impact of getting feedback. If you don't know how to respond to feedback with a growth mindset, I can see where it would be detrimental. But that doesn't make it less valuable. When we aren't open to feedback, we aren't open to learning and growing. It's not always warm and fuzzy, and that's the point. We have to learn to manage the good and the bad in a productive way. In my own businesses and in the corporate setting, I always encourage feedback because if we don't know what we are doing wrong, or what we could be doing better, we cannot improve.

Self Appreciation Post: I‚Äôve learned a lesson while I‚Äôve been hitting the gym. It‚Äôs that the loud approval we are looking for is within. You have the be the one to be proud of your progress. The people will only focus on what do do wrong because if they are going to shoot you they pray the shoot themselves. You point a finger 3 are always pointing back. I have a lot of vocal supporters I thank you, to the silent ones who only break silence when I do something wrong I thank you as well. Albeit annoying but both parties help me in my journey to achieve this goal to a healthy style and mindset. Here‚Äôs to a new me. I only pray I‚Äôve learned the strength in loyalty to keep going #fit4less #selflove #healthymindset #growingup

11 WAYS YOU‚ÄôRE BLOCKING MONEY#Money doesn't solve all your #problems but having access to it sure does help lessen your limitations.In business, it's crucial that you have a #healthymindset around money.You can't let your money stories (which can reach all the way back to childhood) determine your present and future relationship with it.If you're letting those old stories make your decisions and rule your life, it'll be very hard for you to grow in business.A mindset of #negativity surrounding money will keep money away from you because‚Ä¶you believe it to be ‚Äúbad,‚Äù and we avoid things that are bad, or you feel there‚Äôs ‚Äúnot enough,‚Äù and won‚Äôt seek or accept it.1. You keep saying/thinking, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford it.‚Äù Do a #selfcheck: can you really not afford it? The words you use become your #reality, so the next time you don‚Äôt want to buy something, say that. Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI can't afford it.‚Äù2. When you think of money, #dread fills your whole body. Um‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt have more of what you dread. So try to think about some fun things you can do with money!3. When someone offers to pick up the bill, you argue and/or refuse to let them. If you can‚Äôt give yourself the grace to #receive, then money won‚Äôt find its way to you!4. You can pay for someone else‚Äôs dream...but not yours. (Hey- Money is something to be enjoyed... by YOU, too!)5. As soon as you imagine the possibility of doing or having something you‚Äôd like, you immediately think ‚ÄúI wish!‚Äù and let the dream go. Anchor into that #dream, instead. And focus on the logistics of things - the how, what, where, when. You‚Äôll achieve them more easily when you‚Äôre in the #momentum of thinking about doing them!6. When someone says they are buying a #luxury, your immediate reaction is ‚ÄúOh, what a waste!‚Äù This kind of attitude makes you less likely able to enjoy money, and not being able to enjoy something makes you resistant to it.7. You #haggle every single time. You get discounts, deals, and coupons‚Ä¶ but money always seems to be a #struggle. Although haggling can be fun, too much of it restricts your creativity with making more money, as you‚Äôre more likely to focus on spending less instead.8. You keep saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this for money.‚Äù Let‚Äôs be honest - Who are you trying to convince?9. Your socks have holes and your shoes are about to surrender!! And you still #delay replacing them. (Nope. Don‚Äôt even try to tell me it‚Äôs for sentimental value.)10. You don‚Äôt want to #talkmoney.‚Äù Whenever you plan something, you won‚Äôt discuss the #cost, and just keep saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about money.‚Äù Of course money isn‚Äôt something to be worried about. But avoiding talking about it is a form of pushing it away!11. You experience a lot of #shoppersguilt. You buy something, and then you fret if you overspent. Trust you made the right decisions!!! The more you trust your choices, the more conscientious and deliberate you will be!Let me know in the comments: How many of the above are you #guilty of?

Aren't You Tired of Making Excuses? ü§î As much as we hate to admit it, we all made excuses before, and some of us still continue to do so every now and then. Whether it's to get out of things we don't feel like doing, trying something new, or simply because we refude to step out of out comfort zone.üõë  We choose to take the easy way out, by making excuses.While some excuses might appear harmless, the truth is that every excuse you make takes you further away from reaching your full potential. üó£ What are some outcomes of following through and showing up for yourself: ‚¨á ‚úÖ Allows you to stop harping on past failures‚úÖ Focus on your Strengths an build on them‚úÖ Experience a new way of being by becoming the person you want to beüëâ When you learn to be present and focus on what's happening in a given moment, you'll be able to take action.

This is SOOO accurate üéØ I üíØ% Believe in Having Fun At Work and Enjoying What I Do‚Ä¶. Especially With Awesome Co-Workers!!!! There are ALWAYS going to be tough days in ANY company (where you find human beings involved - working or leading ‚Ä¶ because, hello! We are IMPERFECT people, and we don‚Äôt ALWAYS ‚Äúget it right‚Äù), but there has NEVER been a day that I‚Äôve walked into work, where my mood, mindset and spirit wasn‚Äôt lifted by the amazing folks I work with and the guests I have the opportunity to serve. It‚Äôs truly in the GIVING that I feel like I am the one receiving.

Failures shouldn't be complete downfalls. üôÖ As a society, we try our best to avoid it out of fear and embarrassment. The tendency is when we fail, we do our best to cover it up and hide the situation. However, failures should be celebrated as much, probably even equally as our successes, because failures teach us what's wrong and not working. And when we take these defeats as opportunities to learn, we are an inch closer to achieving our goals! üéØLearn from your failures, take the learnings with you, move on, then start anew! ‚ú®‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢#success #mindset #quotes #inspirationalquotes #inspirational #positivetruth #instaquotes #motivationalquotes #healthymindset #napoleonhillquotes

FEEL GOOD FRIDAY üòÉ At Mindspan we are HUGE advocates of expressing gratitude - it creates so much goodness in the brain, and it's also one of the highest forms of emotional experience we can have! So why not kickstart your morning by letting us know in the comments something you're grateful for... big or small, there are no right or wrong answers! Perhaps it's an experience, a moment, an action, a person... maybe even a meal!#coaching #lifecoaching #businesscoaching #coachingtips #gratitude #grateful #mindset #selfempowerment #healthymindset #mindcoach #lifecoachesofinstagram #leadercoach #mindsetiseverything #growthmindset #mindsetshift #mindsetgoals #mindsetwork #powerofmindset #journal

TRUST THE PROCESSIt seems there is a silent race to ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù sooner than everyone else. How to manifest. How to be successful. How to heal your wounds. It‚Äôs not a race. If you think it is, you may be disappointed that you haven‚Äôt ‚Äúfigured it out‚Äù yet. Life unfolds line upon line, precept upon precept. Trusting the process as you discover your gift to manifest, feel into your version of success, or heal one wound at a time will bring much-needed ease to your life.Once, when I was arguing with God about a situation that I was not willing to accept readily, feeling shame for not having it ‚Äúfigured out‚Äù like ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù, I asked why I was faced with doing something I did NOT want to do. With hot tears running down my face, feeling I was out of options, crying like an abandoned 5-year-old, he answered, ‚ÄúBecause I love you.‚Äù¬†It was as if he had wiped my tears and given me the biggest hug. I knowingly and willingly accepted my circumstances and realized there was something bigger to come. Removing the resistance I had to life-changing events I didn‚Äôt know I needed was a relief! I had to let change be good for me even when I didn‚Äôt understand why. I was learning to trust the process (over and over again), so I could grow. Letting go and looking forward IS how you trust the process. That is where you witness personal growth in the works....#mentalhealth #problemsolving #healthymindset #gowiththeflow #anxiety #peaceofmind #personalgrowth #life #trialanderror #difficultlife #depression #emotionalmaturity #emotionalwellness #EI #trustgod #trusttheprocess

The big update is here!ü§©I am also now a Personal Trainer with The Gym Group at their Glasgow South location. ü´∂For the past four years, I've had the pleasure of impacting over 150 lives as an online coach.But I've always enjoyed and missed (since the pandemic) coaching people in person as a personal trainer.So here is that!I genuinely believe that the gym is so much more than just to:‚≠ïÔ∏è Building Muscles‚≠ïÔ∏è Strength‚≠ïÔ∏è Cardiovascular health‚≠ïÔ∏è Stamina‚≠ïÔ∏è FlexibilityThe gym is also:‚úÖ A sanctuary from the stress of work and busy life.‚úÖ Something you can control in a world that often feels totally out of control.‚úÖ A ritual of discipline and effort.‚úÖ A daily dose of emotional well-being.‚úÖ A promise kept to our future selves towards healthier ageing and a better quality of life.‚úÖ A sense of community to meet like-minded people trying to better themselves daily.And much more.Wish me luck in building a community and a safe space where everyone is welcomed and feels they belong!#BigUpdate #nutrition #fintessmadesustainable #coaching #nutritioncoaching #ftinessjourney #fitnesslifestyle #support #habitbuilding #training #losingweight #weightlossjourney #weightloss #weightlossmotivation #fitspo #fatlossjourney #fatlossmotivation #dieting #dieter #weightlossstruggle #weightlosssupport #healthyweightloss #healthymind #healthymindset #fitnessmotivation #fitnessinspiration #cardio #liftingweights #workout #knowledge

A good philosophy to live by for those who feel underappreciated is, genuinely support others in need as you wish others would have supported you in your time of need.This is not an idealistic concept. It's the natural law of cause and effect. You might not know WHEN or WHERE the ball will land because you can't see the whole picture YET. But if you have chosen to release it, you know with conviction, it will land. So sit back and have a drink üçπ while you wait üòâ #karma #choices #causeandeffect #trust #trusttheprocess #philosophyoflife #healthymindset #prospective #transformationalcoaching #patience

Today I am celebrating Julie‚Äôs health transformation story. Like many people, she made a New Year‚Äôs resolution to lose weight last January (2021). There are some who start that same New Year‚Äôs resolution, but give up too quickly, or try to lose weight with a diet such as keto, low carb, intermittent fasting, etc., instead of adopting a healthy lifestyle. When losing weight with a diet approach, what is not changing is one‚Äôs mindset and habits. People can lose a few pounds and then gain it all back.¬†Julie enabled achievement of her New Year‚Äôs resolution because she started an optimal health and wellbeing lifestyle program. It‚Äôs the same lifestyle program that I started in July to lose weight and get healthier.¬†Here is Julie‚Äôs story:‚ÄúLet's talk about those New Year's resolutions!Last January I started my journey to health and Icouldn't be more thrilled to be going into 2022 70 pounds lighter and feeling AMAZING as a healthier version of me!!!! Now I am in control of my health, it's not holding me back anymore!‚Äù#healthylifestyle #weightloss #healthyeating #healthymindset #habitsofhealth #holidaymotivation #newyearsresolution #healthcoach#lifelongtransformation

Morning!!!We should be building up self resilience in a world that is filled with a lot of noise. We chat to the brilliant filmmaker Salomon on just that. How he leads his family to good values and strong mental stance.There‚Äôs a lot of situations that are out of control at the moment in the world. We need to focus on building our own strength for continued growth and happiness.Salomon, a son to missionary parents who opened his eyes to the world, is a self-taught filmmaker whose international background‚Äì‚Äì‚Äìa childhood spent in Johannesburg‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì , Dubai, and Sydney‚Äì‚Äì‚Äìfigures strongly in his distinctive, visceral yet meditative work. His textural and experimental style tries to find new ways of exploring visual and narrative storytelling - always with a human story at its core.His work has garnered recognition across the world, with inclusion in both the Saatchi & Saatchi and 1.4 New Directors Showcases, two Golds and three Silvers at the YDAs, a Gold Cannes Lion, multiple AICP wins with work featured at the MOMA, shortlists for Music Video of the Year at Shots, Best Alternative Video and Best New Director at the UKMVA‚Äôs - and a growing list of awards from the industry including the British Arrows, Cannes D&AD.These honors are all the more extraordinary for a young director ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì , who is just a couple of years into his commercial film career. His body of work includes short films like ‚ÄúRocket Wars,‚Äù which documents the stunning aerial fireworks battle of a Greek village, as well as commercials for Puma, Adidas, Top Boy, S7, Valvoline etc, and music videos for artists like Justin Bieber, Giveon, Little Simz, Skrillex, Don Toliver, Prince, The Weeknd, Daughter, Bearcubs and Young Fathers.Salomon currently lives in New York City with his young family, where he is in the early stages of putting together his debut feature, MOTHERLAND ¬†and writing his second, ICONOCLAST.IG @salomonligthelm #mentalwellness #mentalhealth #mentalwellbeing #bemindful #meditation #thepowerofnow #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmotivation #selfcare #selfhelppodcast #selfhelp #highvibes #healthymindset #manifestation #positiveintentions #positiveliving #raiseyourvibration #inclusion #writing #writing #music #inclusion #film #work #storytelling #career #happiness #growth #dubai #like #video #building #sydney

Do you think about packing in your existing life and making a radical change? What‚Äôs holding you back?Is it fear of success/starting again/moving countries, telling you that you are not good enough ‚Äì or are you listening to other people's fears? üí™üèº You have to push away the fear. We all have this voice, the inner critic, and while its intentions are good, the trick is to keep growing beyond the voice. In a podcast with Paul Kennedy, we discuss how learning to let go of other people's fears helped him to step up another level. Paul explains why he wants to inspire you to break free from your comfort zone and experience life in a new environment.  Remember mindset, confidence and trusting your gut is everything.

According to our (Hindu) ancient scriptures, the conch  was the first thing that came out during the Churning of ocean  by the Deities and Shri Vishnu held it in the form of weapon. The speciality of conch is that the vibrations emanating on blowing it destroys the disease causing germs in the atmosphere. That is the reason it has a important place in Ayurved and medicine. When the conch  is blown before the start of puja, positive energy is emitted from the conch.This energy reduces the strength of distressing frequencies.Spiritual health benefits of blowing conch :1. Blowing the conch helps keeping your mind free from negative thoughts.2. Uplifts spirituality.3. Genrates zeal & positivity to begin the day with focused mind.Neuroscience says that there is strong bond between sound and emotional states of human brain. Blowing conch shell and listening to its sound and conch self itself has a lot of uses. Cosmic energy of the earth gets magnified on entering the conch shell. These vibrations radiate positive vibes and eradicate negative energy from surroundings. The blowing of conch shell makes the atmosphere holy, pure, and conducive for the spiritual growth of the individual. It also augments the positive psychological vibrations such as optimism, hope, determination, and willpower. These can also be felt by people listening to it. Brain‚Äôs response to the sound of the conch shell is studied using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings.The EEG signals result from recording the electrical activity produced by firing of neurons in human brain. The moment Shankh is blown our brain is emptied of all thoughts and one enters a state of Trans where he/she is more receptive.Wishing you and your family a very Happy Diwali.Live The Integrated Lifeüôèüôèüôèüôè

Winter is here and the holidays are just around the corner. Although many are filled with joy, others find this time difficult to navigate. Be kind, uplift, and support one another.Seasonal Affective Disorder occurs when the days get shorter, thus less sun and the temperature cools off. Those that are energized by the sun may experience¬†a shift in their mood. They may have decreased interest in activities they enjoyed, as well as increased anxiety and feelings of sadness.¬†#WellnessWednesday#Selfcare¬†#Selfcarematters#CommunityCare#CommunitySupport#Healthyboundaries¬†#JustBreathe#Peaceofmind¬†#Balancedlifestyle#HealthyMindset¬†#SelfReflection#Mentalhealth

Push oder Pull Methode? Wieso Gesundheitsapps nicht im Gesundheitsmanagement reichenDer Markt an Apps zu Gesundheitsl√∂sungen ist riesig. Ob Meditation, gesundes Leben, Stressmanagement, mentale St√§rke und und und.Ebenso sind sie im Vergleich zu normalen Schulungen kosteng√ºnstig.Was ist denn nun so falsch an Apps?Die Erwartungshaltung f√ºr den Nutzen im Gesundheitsmanagement.Erwartungshaltung: Mitarbeiter finden relevante Informationen, lesen sie gr√ºndlich, machen einen Minikurs und dann nehmen sie die √Ñnderungen im eigenen Arbeitsalltag vor.Dem ist leider nicht so, es braucht unterschiedliche Methoden, um die Mitarbeiter zu erreichen und auch menschliche Begleitung.Ansonsten hast Du eine reine Push Methode.70 % des Engagements eines Teams wird nach dem Gallup von F√ºhrungskr√§ften beeinflusst.M√∂chtest du ges√ºndere Mitarbeiter, dann nutze die Pull Methode. Die Garantie das Informationen auch integriert und umgesetzt werden ist F√ºhrungssache. Hole Dir gerne uns als Experten hinzu.Hier eine L√∂sung bei einem Kunden aus dem Bereich IT, der das Ziel hatte, die Stresskompetenzen der Mitarbeiter zu verbessern:1.Abfrage der Teilnehmer zum eigenen Stressverhalten: Die Mitarbeiter werden aktiv eingebunden und m√ºssen Eigeninitiative zeigen.2.Durchf√ºhrung des Praxisworkshops:Die Mitarbeiter erhalten wichtige Tools f√ºr die eigene Arbeitsumgebung.3.Blended Learning: In 30 Minuten pro Woche (6 Wochen) vertiefen die Mitarbeiter die Inhalte in einem Online Lernprogramm mit Workbook.4.Mental Coaching: Die Mitarbeiter haben alle zwei Wochen 1 Stunde Coaching und k√∂nnen pers√∂nliche Themen kl√§ren.5.Reflexion und Heranf√ºhrung: Zugang zur Lernplattform, wo interaktive Tools zu unterschiedlichen Themen zum Nachlesen abgelegt sind. Reflexion mit F√ºhrungskraft nach einem MonatWie gew√§hrleistest Du, dass Deine Mitarbeiter gesund mit sich umgehen?#gesundheitsapps #healtyapps #pullmethod #blendedlearning #healthymindset

It goes straight to the kidneys and causes you to urinate more frequently. Frequent urination reduces both excess water and sodium in your body.2) Fruits and veggies: Fruits and vegetables, in addition to being vitamin and nutrient rich, are among the top foods that act as diuretics, again because of their high water content. Make sure they are washed in the food washing machine üôÇ3) Caffeine: If you want to use caffeine as a diuretic, go for green tea, which is a source of caffeine along with a helpful immune boostLet's JOIN AURAZ FATZ BURNER EMPOWERMENT BOOTCAMP https://lnkd.in/gHrhpmsGüíú Auraz Fatz Burner EmpowermentWant to know your visceral fat and body fat level?

Keeping healthy and eating healthy are vital ingredients. We often underestimate the importance of looking after our minds.****Let me break it down-Everything we begin to embark on starts with a thought. That thought keeps that journey alive and strong. That‚Äôs called placing our mindset on what is best for us.We feel good when we are positive and feel shitty when we are not being mindful of our actions, simply equalling to being mindless fact!****Just 5 minute a day of meditation and pausing to breathe contributes to you mentally.Baby steps begin and consistency through thought enables you to keep going. (Be mindful of that)!****#meditation #mindset #mindsetcoach #helenaphilfitness #nurtureyourmind #bodymind #bodypositivity #healthymindset #loveyourmindüíö ****New website on my mindset coaching coming soon!
