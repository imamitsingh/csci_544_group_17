Cuss, cry, complain‚Ä¶this is the time for that. You work crayzay hard. You are allowed a week. Sitting with it‚Äù prevents reactivity and enables a better choice to be made.

This post and article hit me in the gut. It raises some important questions not only about how we work, but also the role of branding as a practice. As a brand identity strategist, and change management practitioner, am I doing more harm in contributing toward helping companies build and elevate their brands? Have we, as a profession, taken the role of brand as a badge for employee/consumer identification and affiliation too far? On one hand, having pride in one‚Äôs work is a noble cause for work. On the other, taking that pride to unhealthy levels of objectification can have tremendous repercussions. As an employee, I agree with what this article opines: your profession is not a personality. But as a branding professional, I believe we have a higher calling to ensure our work lifts people up. There should be space for brands, employees and the individual to thrive together, and not at the expense of the other.I feel for #tweeps who find themselves in new territory amidst the recent slew of tech #layoffs, but hope that the culture they embraced and espoused becomes a major attractor for business and companies seeking to add to their ranks. For those recently laid off, not sure what to do regarding their personal brands or positioning for their next endeavor, ping me. Let‚Äôs chat. I‚Äôd be happy to help advise at no cost.  #brand #branding #people #changemanagement #brandstrategist

A lot of tech illusions got shattered this year. Many of the deeply funded unicorns turned out to built on very fragile foundations. Big established tech companies turned out to be just as volatile. Many of the CEOs being celebrated in PR pieces were the most reckless of all. It‚Äôs hard to be surprised that employees don‚Äôt feel loyalty when our industry showed them how disposable they were when it got hard. How irresponsibly paper thin the business fundamentals were in the pursuit of hypergrowth. Many leaders failed their employees this year, and the wounds won‚Äôt heal quickly. We need to do better. #layoffs #techindustry

On July 15, 2006 Twitter was launched publicly, and in 2013, Twitter opened its first office in India. At that time, there were around 11 million users from India on Twitter. Today, India accounts for the third-largest user base on Twitter with more than 23 million users. The growth story is phenomenal, and indisputably, this couldn‚Äôt have been possible without a team of motivated and bright individuals.Being at I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee) for almost a decade, I understand how tough and challenging it is to build something from scratch.If what I hear of the current layoffs of around 170 employees from Twitter India is true, then it is very saddening. But on the brighter side, this gives I-PAC an opportunity to welcome such talent to start something completely new and exciting with us.

When companies make the incredibly difficult decision to downsize, it should be handled with care, compassion and through a lens of equity and inclusion. What we saw on Friday at Twitter is an example of unexamined, toxic layoff culture and firing practices that are devoid of humanity and respect. The folks at Twitter deserved so much better. Here's what we can learn from it.#layoffs #layoffculture #firing #inclusion #diversity #humanityfirst #empathyinaction #twitter #workculture

Inmigration laws that push H1B holders to find a job for just 60 days after they are laid off are stupid and inhumane- Stupid: top notch highly qualified workers that in most situations have been educated in US top universities for years. Shedding this top talent strengthens other countries economies and diluted US competitiveness. - Inhumane: Most visa cardholders have built their lives, families, connections, houses, and financial reality around a certain geography in the US. The possibility of that reality being ripped away in a moments notice is inhumane. Period. Check this effort from Ayal Chen-Zion to change this

If your recruiters are good they have transferrable skills that can be used by the sales or marketing teams or client success. Give them a cross functional assignment or put them to work. Then when the org rebounds you have them ready to go, they have improved skills AND know you have demonstrated that people really are your most important asset.  This is how you build a brand and build true trust from your people. Tell me who is going to recruiter harder and sell your organization better. The recruiter you held onto when the tough got going or the new hire that was brought in because you suddenly realized you need more people?  #marketing #brand #success #people #recruiter

Will #twitter stop working even after so many people are laid off? No!Lean is GOOD. Lean is RIGHT.A lot of people hire a lot of people to do very little work. And these lots create artificial hierarchies. They slow growth.I absolutely support Elon and what Steve did when he gained apple back.A lesson for everyone:When you're getting hired, don't let the artificial narrative / PR of a company blind you. Ask your hiring manager and check his/ her depth of the company. The vision, the problems being solved.If you are not convinced then you are stepping in an artificially created jazzy story.This fable will end sooner.#layoffs

My heart goes out to those impacted by the recent spate of layoffs Having been in that boat three times in my career, I know how it feelsAnd while I do not have any job openings to share, there is something small I can doAnd that idea hit me in the shower today (that's where I have my light bulb moments!!)And that is to host those impacted by these layoffs on my show #StandOutIn90SecAnd give them a video that they can post in their featured profile section right here on #LinkedInSo their profile can stand out in their job huntHow would this featured video look ? Well check out a couple of my past guests - Safa Hassan, Anthony Gibbs It does work BTW - a past guest Anushya Peiris future employer watched the video and liked it !!

Everyone in and around my network who has been affected by the recent layoffs, or knows someone who has been, I am doing one of the 2 things:1. Either reacting or commenting on your post, or2. following you or sending you a connection request (doing this without a proper introductory msg might seem a bit odd, but I believe these are desperate times)The overall idea is to get your post and more importantly the profile visible to my existing network and hope it matches you up with someone looking to fill up a role.I am aware that sometimes this may not be enough but having experienced the anxiety of not being able to secure a job on a tight timeline as an immigrant has, in some ways, taught me that the support we get from supporting each other is the best thing out there. This is me doing my tiny bit to help you out.#layoffs #hiring #community

Friday was a difficult and sad day for me and a community of 200 employees I was so grateful to be a part of: #OneTrust announced they are closing Planetly by OneTrust and with that, letting go of our entire staff. This comes around a year after OneTrust acquired Planetly.I joined #Planetly back in March and in these eight months, I got to learn an incredible amount about #CarbonManagement while also growing professionally. For the first time, I was able to fully be myself at a workplace and I owe this to my amazing team who were so inspiring and hard-working, but also to the entire diverse and purpose-driven workforce. I am thankful for this opportunity and I would not change a thing. üíöBut while I am mentally still processing what this means for me, I feel disappointed. I am disappointed by economic factors as the sole basis in decision-making. I am also disappointed in reporting directives being delayed or watered down in a way that they do not truly hold companies accountable for their #ESG practices. It has shown again and again that #sustainability is unfortunately not a path that the market can walk voluntarily. It might innovate but it will not change, and change is what we need.Immediately after the news, the Planetly staff has come together and supported each other and only in these two days, the gratitude expressed by customers and the support from networks has been overwhelming. I wish everyone the best, and I truly hope we can continue fighting the climate crisis. üåç #layoffs

The market will recuperate. It might not happen tomorrow or the day after, but it will. Companies will be back hiring in full steam and will want to quickly onboard new team members. Those who let go of a high % today would like to fill the gaps.There are very few better ways for that than to re-hire past employees‚ÄìWhat we call Boomerang hiring: 1) They are familiar with the org, the culture, the tools2) They acquired an external view and critical view on how to improve things that made them leave in the first place (having time to reflect)3) They tend to be more loyal with longer tenure (saw numbers backing this up at G)Investment in such recruitment departments is something most medium size (and even big corporations) don't do and that can be a huge pitfall in their hiring funnel. Sometimes it's enough to maintain a file with the contact info of past folks.BTW, this is also why you need to off-board well, so people will actually want to come back...#recruitment #layoffs

With layoffs hindsight has 202:20 vision. It's easier to assert after the event that a company grew too quickly but is this always the case?Wasn't the hiring done to meet real demand? Should short term opportunities be forgone for long term stability? Aren't hiring and layoffs synonymous with the ebbs and flows of business?Had the laid off staff not been hired, would they still be unemployed or would they have been hired elsewhere? Do we know for sure? Should founders keep apologising for layoffs? Or are the apologies for the effect on people laid off and not really the layoff itself?Hindsight has 20:20 vision.#layoffs #twitter

When times are tough, it can be easy to feel like giving up. Tough times don't last forever ‚Äì but tough people do last. Tough people are the ones who keep going even when things are tough. They don't give up when things get difficult. They keep going, because they know that tough times don't last.#recession #twitter #layoffs

Do you know the worst thing to say to someone who lost their job? It's nothing. Here are 6 words (plus a text) you can send to someone with a career plot twist.I heardI'm sorryI'm hereI've talked to many people who've made career transitions as I did almost five years ago.¬†We agreed that we'll never forget the people who connected - and a few that didn't. üòâIn the best of circumstances, big career changes are lonely.With layoffs in the news it seemed timely to share this example.A client asked me how to respond when a colleague lost their job. ‚ùå They wanted to avoid internal politics‚úÖ They respected their colleague and enjoyed working with themI drafted a sample text so he could stop stalling and reach out.It's not that complicated, friends.¬†There‚Äôs no downside to being kind to a client, colleague, or even a friendly competitor.It's like funerals. You just go.You being there isn't reminding someone that they lost a loved one. It shows they made a difference and matter to you.Who shoud you reach out to? It's never too late.#employeebenefits #insurancebrokers #benefits #layoffs #career

I am sure many of you have already caught wind of one of the most historic layoffs in the tech industry. I and my entire team were among the many that fell under the ax as part of Twitter's transition.¬†Our team was part of the Trust & Safety wing that focussed on Data & Analytics. We have worked on several high-impact projects in the content moderation space both internally and publicly (most notable being https://lnkd.in/gQFb7UTs) to ensure the platform's safety.The last 6 months have been quite a challenge, especially considering the ambiguity we were faced with as an organization, but that being said, I couldn't have been happier about the spirit of my team that weathered through the circumstances while continuing to produce high-quality work. Just like the famous Randy Pauch quote goes, ‚Äúwe cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†If any of you are on the look for knowledgeable, proactive, team players in Data Analytics, Data Science, or Business Intelligence please take a shot at considering Aishwarya Dingre, Carlos Nunez, Christina Nshanian, Darianne Lopez, Graham Chuck, Monica Dhamale, Nikhil K., Tony Sze. You will truly have a valuable and gratifying experience working with them. I, for sure, did!¬†#oneteam #layoffs #twitterlayoffs #lovewhereyouworked #lovewhoyouworkedwith #dataanalytics #businessintelligence #datascience

Layoffs are back in the news this week. Twitter, of course, leads with 3,700. Stripe released about 1,000, but notably handled it better than Twitter. Lots of other companies laid off smaller numbers that didn't make the news. Back in the 90s, Albert Dunlap was well-known for his turnaround skills as a CEO. But what he is most remembered for is one thing: massive layoffs anytime he joined a company. He was called "Chainsaw Al" as a result. Famed General Electric CEO Jack Welch was also a fan of layoffs. He made them a regular part of his annual plans. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple he let half the company go. Sometimes layoffs are the best thing for the company. And that's the point - the health of the company and the ROI to the shareholders is the number one goal - always. If you are an employee you are an expense. Labor is typically the number one cost for any company, so when it needs to make cuts labor is the first place to look. Whether the company is large or small, layoffs happen. Whether you're one of 5,000 let go, or one of five, the outcome for you is the same. You can't control any of it. You can spend your career looking over your shoulder, or you can start looking toward creating a better future. If you're ready to build something for you instead of building it for the shareholders - let's talk.#career #layoffs #findyourpath

Surely it hurts to loose a Job not only to one person but to whole family.But atleast Elon's twitter providing 3 months severance which I think even better to get them work for 3 months and then showing them way of exit. Atleast now they get more time to find another better Job or can just build a whole new social media platform that can compete with Twitter. I Suggest all should go for entrepreneurship
-----------------------------
I remember quitting a job after 3.5 years. I thought a 1 month notice was going to be enough to help the company transition. The evening I told my CEO I was resigning, I was told to immediately leave and come back later to get my stuff. I was shocked and saddened. Another job I had, within a year they were going to layoff a big chunk of my department (including me). I had a chance to talk to a cofounder and explained what I do and was given his support to find a new role in the company. Within a couple weeks I found a new role AND I was also reoffered my original position with a promotion and raise. I took the latter. Things don‚Äôt always go as planned at work. I know a lot of you are facing #layoffs right now. I hope you can turn this challenge into an opportunity AND something better. Don‚Äôt give up on yourself. #yougotthis #beopen #onwardsandupwards

I read a post about companies not being mindful of the employees and their families when they do layoffs and that they dont reskill and redeploy you. What we have to realize is companies are operating with "other peoples money". Investors who raise money from other investors who tap into pension funds (people in the last leg of their lives risking losing money and never making it again). In a down economy there is no benefit in investing in the future (which is what reskilling does) as you are struggling to stay afloat. So people have to rightskill not reskill. Its possible that layoffs are not just about numbers but rightskilling thrown into the mix. Companies like Zoho or Zerodha are not under that pressure because they dont run their business with other people's money. Everyone else does. BYJU'S for example is a loss making gig that does all its work with OPM. I am not defending or villifying anyone but you owe it to yourself to know the difference between operating with Other peoples money and expecting to care for your situation and those that actually have their own invested or generated money and can make the operational decsions they do. #economy #business #layoffs

This improved model accuracy by x%, reduced training time from x to y and pipelines ingested x amount of data weekly. Most recent job to least recent job order. Only add relevant jobs. If you were a waiter at a restaurant, do not add it in for an ML job. Even if you did gain some customer service skills from that role, the hiring manager isnt going to care. A sentence for each role in line with the example i gave above is all you need.Then at the bottom add in your educational background, add a sentence summary for your major and thesis (if PhD)Lots of times i see - MSc in Computer Science, ok great, what was your major in?And thats it folks.Happy to help anyone techncial that has been laid off with CV advice.

How to do layoffs in the right way ‚úÖThe wave of layoffs continues, and there is a lot of fear and uncertainty about one's future right now. Elon Musk was very brutal in the way he took over Twitter and fired 75% of the company. An email goes out, and access to accounts (email, slack etc) are immediately locked out. Stripe also made their layoffs this past week, with 14% affected, It was the nature of the mail that went out by the CEO which really demonstrates a good leader with true empathy. There was a full explanation, admitting the business growth mistakes they made. There is also a very generous layoff package detailed, and also an alumni group setup for them to recognise their service to the company. You can feel the authenticity and compassion in this mail. I hope other CEO's take the right approach during these difficult times. Layofffs during a recession are inevitable. It is then how you go about the layoffs and deal with human beings that truly matters. Credit to Hung Lee and his Recruiting Brainfood newsletter today for sharing this.

It has been three months since me being laid pff by Shutterfly. Although I got one offer from a big company in August, but the offer was withdrawn due to my working visa situation. So, I am still trying my best to find one employer that sponsors work visa for international workers. It's literally heartbreaking recently every time I found layoff news on LinkedIn. It would be more difficult to rebuild up the positivity than usual in this year. Sending hugs to everyone in my connection. Jobs cannot define us. Life is a long run.

Recently my feed has been filled with layoffs. My husband and I have thankfully not been directly impacted, but it was beyond eye opening. We won't ever forget the moment I asked him to check his email on a sick day. I had just found out some of our co-workers had been let go and didn't know if he was one of them. I swear I didn't breath the whole time he caught up on the emails from the day.To anyone in my network, no matter how long it has been, if I can help in any way I am more than happy to do so. Say it with me:"You are amazing.These layoffs are not a reflection of your worth.You are valid.You are skilled.You would be an amazing addition to any workplace."Please repeat until you believe it! I have been slowly writing recommendations and making connections and am continuing to do so as I can.

Most of us plan our career like a unidirectional wind. We think of new skills, new job, promotion, hike, bonus but we rarely think of organizational and project initiatives or offloading your senior's and colleagues load. I have worked in small teams as well as in huge ones, big firms and small startup, seniors as well as with many interns and have seen very few approaching their seniors & super seniors asking for more work, side hustle and weekend work plans. These rare ones are often star performers and on fast track.Careers where you don't slog often lead to regrets. Change the path until it's late. #work #career #jobhustle #layoffs

To my ex-Chimers and anyone in my network who has been impacted by layoffs recently, especially in UX research and design- I am so sorry for what you're going through. No matter what, layoffs are stressful and painful to say the least. Whatever you're feeling - anger, excitement, depression, anxiety...it's all normal. For those of you who want to take some time and decompress before heading into the job hunt, I'm here for you when you're ready.For those of you looking now, please do not hesitate to message me if you see any connections in my network or intros you'd like me to make. I'm also here to be a sounding board if you want to jam on resume writing, portfolios, or interview prep.I also want to share these two UX groups where I tend to find a lot of great job leads (and where I've shared my own job posts in the past):1. Mixed-Methods Slack group- primarily for researchers, but also see several design jobs in their jobs channel. https://lnkd.in/gZENMMEr2. Design Research Google group- A great UX community that frequently posts jobs. Happy to add any UX designers, researchers, and ops if you send me your email.I also know Smartsheet is looking for a Senior UX Researcher. I've heard nothing but great things about this remote-friendly company, and you'd get to work with Mariana Almeida, one of the most thoughtful and skilled UX researchers I've had the pleasure of working with. https://lnkd.in/gdZE82kvIf anyone knows of other UX groups like the ones above as great resources for job leads, please share in the comments for visibility! ‚ù§Ô∏èAnyone in my network hiring researchers, designers, or analysts?

Would not be surprised at all if someone deleted all of Musk's tweets and kills his account (even temporarily) or if he is attacked publicly. Firing people like this is just disgraceful. Shows the kind of person he is, an insane maniac just focussed on money. Yeah he spent 44B, but no one made him do it, it was his call. Really hope the class action lawsuit against him goes through. Many people fired were on H1B and are now sitting on a time bomb ready to explode during the holidays and make 2022 the worst year of their life. What a waste.#twittertakeover #idiot #layoffs

I have a presentation on #Twitter and I have to give Insights on the step taken by Elon Musk which led to many skilled hands going "jobless"................Here are some insights!!!!!- Twitter was bought from the Shareholders at a hefty amount of $44 Billion- The Firm has been in loss from years now and just in the last fiscal year, twitter has faced a whooping loss of $122 Million- Elon Musk wanted to recover debt and the best strategy he thought was to wipe 50% of its workforce and go with the tactic of #contractual #hiring to cover up the gaps!----------------------------------------------------------------------------This simply means, Elon Musk feels, the only way to recover debts is not by applying real time strategies but just by firing the staff..............Well, its high time we start valuing the true #entrepreneurs who can think about strong debt recovery #strategies beyond #layoffs!Also, strongly in support of the highly "skilled" laid off employees!

A Company which goes on hiring spree will ultimately have to layoff people at the most difficult of times .Company can say they need to improve company's health and lay you off but nobody will think about the employee .Company takes more risks so company will decide when people will come in and go.People should always see the indicators and decide whether to join a uncertain company with higher pay or a stable one with comparatively less pay .#layoffs #people #health

On Friday, Elon Musk fired about half of the staff at Twitter. By email. To be clear: There are thousands of reasons why a company has to let go of employees, or at least thinks that this is the right decision. I‚Äôm certainly not in the position to judge whether there might have been good intentions or just a sense of sacrifizing staff for higher margins in this particular case. Even though I have some sort of idea, that‚Äôs not the point.What feels utterly wrong is how the staff was informed of the downsizing. By email. With a strange pre-announcement that these emails would be sent to the affected colleagues, probably causing many of them sleepness nights. Let‚Äôs not forget: There are real people behind each personnel number. People with feelings, fears, hopes, dreams, different backgrounds and stories. Letting go of someone is always hard. If you have to do it, the least you can do is to- act like a human being and grown-up. - be kind and show some empathy.- inform employees in person about their lay-off.- make room for questions or concerns from the affected colleagues and genuinely listen.- offer your support and open up your network to provide access to new job opportunities (if useful).Maya Angelou very wisely said: ‚ÄûPeople will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel‚Äú.Let‚Äôs make the wise decision to not making feel employees that are affected by a lay-off even worse. Not because you‚Äôre forced to, but because it‚Äôs the right thing to do.Disclaimer: I highly doubt that the people in my network would follow such a bad example of leadership, but had to get this off my chest.Photo credit: Gabriela Palai, pexels.com#leadership #empathy #layoffs

Candidates asking questions related to Job security, How about working with Elon Musk's companies (Twitter/Tesla/SpaceX etc)? Will you even give it a thought after receiving an offer from above due to current layoff? #Twitter laid off more than 50% of its current workforce. Employee/employer both have their own version of story according to Elon Musk there was no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day, and everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required. As a leader people may not be happy with every decision you make, sometimes you have to take harsh decisions considering the business/macroeconomic situation.  #business #layoffs #jobsecurity

Absolutely this should be looked at and revised by USCIS and those responsible for immigration reforms. Technically it is not even 60 days, one has to land a job around 30-35 day mark to then allow enough time for paperwork and filing of H1B. Even with premium processing those steps can take 15+ days easily. And btw, in that period one also has to parallel plan what to do with their property, car etc. in case they have to leave. While i have heard employers have notified H1B employees in some cases ahead of time and set termination date in future to work around the flaws in process, 99% of cases employers don‚Äôt care!!! #immigration #h1bvisa #layoffs

My layoff story?There's none. Early in my career, I was a job hopper. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èYes, I was constantly looking for more challenge and more learning. And every job I landed next brought me a higher salary (by at least 20%).This was around 15-20 years ago, but it's applicable on the current job market too.Manage your career, instead of letting "things happen".Start searching immediately if:1Ô∏è‚É£ you see changes are coming and you get this awful feeling in your stomach:  merger, acquisition, restructuring2Ô∏è‚É£ you hear layoff rumours 3Ô∏è‚É£ you are miserable in your job, no matter how long/short you are with the company You don't owe anything to anyone,  except to yourself. Fortes fortuna iuvat. üôÇ...and, life is too short to spend it somewhere where you are not appreciated. #layoffs #jobsearch #career #management #humanresources #happiness #oliveracoaching Olivera Coaching & Consulting

My heart üíî is with thousands of people who lost their jobs at #Twitter, #Sripe, #Lyft, and #Brightline last week.It's tough times...Experiencing job loss and #layoffs are devastating...They have financial, emotional and social taxes on individuals and their families! And when these events are handled poorly by the companies, it could be even more damaging for those who got impacted....Twitter handled its layoffs poorly period. I don't like to stop at the problem statement and always like to offer solutions.So here are what I would like to offer everyone who got impacted last week or (anytime) by #RIFs and #Layoffs:‚ñ∂Ô∏è Keep your heads up and know it wasn't you...it's where these businesses are at.‚ñ∂Ô∏è Take some time to digest, reflect and then kick off your job search.‚ñ∂Ô∏è Tap into your network. Reach out to me or anyone in your network for intros to companies you see have job openings. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è For anyone who sees this and/or worked with me in the past (or knows me from any interaction), I'm happy to offer LinkedIn profile and resume reviews (for free) to support you in your job search.‚ñ∂Ô∏è History has shown that downtimes are some of the best times to start a company. If you have the skills, idea, and passion, go for it. This is the time. üë®‚Äçüíªüîéüë©‚ÄçüíªIf you are at a company that is still #hiring, please "comment" below with the name of your company, so others looking for jobs can see it.Please share/reshare this post and if there's anything you can do for the job seekers feel free to add your flavor too.

In a sea of #layoffs, I share this story. Many years ago, I spent 4 months #interviewing  for a #dreamjob  in my dream city making more than I had every made. I didn't get the job, and for many reasons that turned out to be ok--especially considering that one year later, the program was eliminated and everyone got #laidoff. I survived the disappointment and moved on to something making more #money, doing exactly what I like to do, and with ultimate #flexibility: working for myself. Lessons? 1. What is meant for you will be. 2. Job security is an #illusion. 3. The #best is yet to come.

Anne M. Mulcahy, former CEO and Chairperson of Xerox Corporation has rightly said; "Employees are a company‚Äôs greatest asset ‚Äì they‚Äôre your competitive advantage.‚Äù Unfortunately, not every company follows this master key to success and growth. As we know that Byju‚Äôs, our own homegrown unicorn EdTech brand has recently layoffs 2500-odd employees. This is quite disheartening to see such scenarios growing in the Indian job market. Surprisingly, when they are not able to take care of their own people who work hard for them at a critical juncture; they are able to endorse Lionel Messi as their global ambassador at the same time. Oh What a GOAL!!!... you messed up with your own people and come up with an Ad showing Messi ‚Äì well for many this message is not at all clear. Every company should remember that unless you have a sustainable and ethical approach within the company; it will be challenging to grow. When you treat your people as part of the company and encourage them to make a difference; eventually they will. You cannot expect a good result from unhappy employees who are uncertain about their future. In this era of cut-throat competition, remember that your employees are your backbone. So, give them a good reason to come back to office tomorrow.#Byjus #Layoffs #Career #EmployeeSatisfaction #EdTech

Layoff within a week??Oct 27 - Acquisition of TwitterNov 4 - Layoff of substantial workforce initiatedAll the news seems to portray is a man who acquires a company and is brutally laying off. I seem to wonder that how can Elon Musk know the exact number, name and designation of people to be terminated within a week's time? Is he such a genius to precisely know that these layoffs won't affect twitter's existing services and operations? How can he possibly has this confidence?Now this is possible only if he knew beforehand, pre-acquisition about the excess staff.Acquisition was initiated on April 14 and it took 6 months for information that Musk required, and it is reasonable to assume what information was provided by Twitter's old management?Jack Dorsey apology is much more than only hiring people early for a growing company. It is sharing the exact number of excess staff which was hired for future growth and are dispensable at the moment?Any thoughts?#twitter #layoffs https://lnkd.in/dCDZZ7TY

-----------------------------
Confusion I have based on heating news from around the world.What is the real meaning of layoff? Is it a reflection of your work or your workspace? What really goes inside the mind of a person who just got laid off(in polite words, part of a restructuring activity)?Does it make you question, whether you were working hard enough, or whether it was going to happen inevitably?  Does it make you wonder, people who were chosen to stay back, what is it that they were involved in that in a random selection or a strategic decision they survived this wave?It was a rational decision for the organization, but you may have an irrational connection with the project or job you are associated with for a really long time. Many years, many late nights, fighting, developing for a feature to be added to a product/project that you don't own, and then suddenly you are no longer associated with it.Should you question your abilities, or the confidence, skills, knowledge, and experience you have working as a protective cover from all the negative thoughts? One of the brightest minds of this generation and still in a vulnerable situation has to be a rare scenario.Is anyone to Blame? Someone should take accountability?I am very fortunate that I have not faced this situation till now. But I think someone should start a support group for this.#jobs #people #toughtimes #layoffs

I just saw an asinine post for someone offering a "free" webinar (which is of course a sales pitch for resume services) stating that the ATS is your Enemy - COMPLETE AND UTTER BS.  So I'm sharing Amy's video and my own article in the comments about what all the fuss is about and how to actually format your resume for the best possible outcome (where you don't have to fill in all the fields after uploading it - that is what an "ATS Compliant" or "ATS friendly" resume is). Don't get sucked in based on fear mongering. #resume #ICallATSBS #jobsearchtips #jobsearchhelp #layoffs

Golden List Of Opportunities¬†ü§ØNot Just one or two job openings, but hundreds of opportunities across roles like PM, UX, Full stack, and many more at just one Twitter thread.Thanks to Shreyas Doshi for the tweet. (Link in the comments)And¬†If you are someone who has been laid off, don‚Äôt rush into getting into another job until and unless you have strict financial constraints.There's might be multiple reasons for a company to lay off their employees, if it's due to the economic downturn, the problem with vision, or funding issues then you don't have to worry as you can job at another companyBut the reason is due to lack of skills and becoming the weight to the company budget. Please think twice and plan a roadmap to learn and improvise on skills that don't take to the current scenario.Never bet on short-term gains, let's learn skills that keep us in the demand for the next minimum 5 years.Everything happens for a reason, it's a call for you to grab a better opportunity.#jobs #layoffs #faang #hiring

For anyone affected by recent #layoffs - below are thoughts from when I was laid off from Tesla. Let me know if I can help make introductions, edit your resume, write a compelling cover letter, or help you job search.1. Give yourself space and grace. This is a minor interruption in your long career span - don't let this rock your confidence. 2. Find your silver lining. Is there anything you've put off or were scared to do? Put that side hustle into action (let me help you file an LLC!) or maybe use this time to explore another industry #careerswithpurpose 3. Build your network. Start making new connections in different industries or spaces. Ask for introductions and learn about new professions (I have a great email template, blurb, etc - just ask!).4. Invest in you. There are free courses on Coursera, CE courses through your local college, or through state-run programs. Or take a moment to clear your mind; visit family/friends before diving back into applications and interviews.DM me if you have questions or need help #yougotthis #resumehelp #networking

HUGE layoffs under the pretext of saving overheads, yet we see the same brands spending massive amounts of money on sponsorship / ads..?What on earth? As an entrepreneur I feel the need to say this - AS LOUD AS I CAN.These are people that have bled into building your brand, lets be considerate. Bleed for them once in a while - if you have some bit of humanity.I (an entrepreneur) signed up for -Risk, uncertainty, and fighting against all odds to build a business, with the possibility of making massive gains in the case everything goes well.Employees DON'T sign up for this!They give you their time, skills and build YOUR dream IN EXCHANGE for stability, being paid for their time & skills. No one can work under the anxiety of a possible job loss that has nothing to do with performance. I understand that situations can push stakeholders towards a wall at times, but this trend of mass hiring and mass firing has everyone in a position of a trust deficit.Employees simply can't trust companies to look out for their best interests, and take up other gigs to find the stability, and then employers (feeling betrayed) further prove the same point by firing their employees for moonlighting. The point of this post - I would like to appeal to my fellow entrepreneurs, small businesses and MNCs - whoever can find it in their heart to give a damn..Do whatever you can to sustain your business through the anticipated hard times ahead, and do whatever it takes to NOT fire the very people that invested into building you up till here.Please feel free to connect with me if you've lost a job - I would be happy to push your profile through my networkPS: I don't intend to condemn anyone for their actions. Maybe they had their reasons, maybe they didn't have a choice, maybe this is me going on an emotional rant, in the hope for a better, more humane corporate structure.#employeesmatter #layoffs #startups #entrepreneurship #corporatesustainability

To all my friends who are affected by layoffs :Downsizing, Cut backs, layoffs have always been a corporate strategy to find their pivot, to ensure they prevail. As employees we MUST engrave this in our minds that we are "Expendable Assets" (read these two words over and over again until you get what it means) . A company thrives and lives on profit, it is as selfish as we all are.Either way we must remember, we are not married to a company, we can still find it in our selves to hunt for another. All it takes is a little conviction üí™Keep at it, dont you ever give up, don't you ever give in. #layoffs #dontgiveup #lifeadvice #jobhunt2022 #techindustry #slowdown #twitter #google #walmart

My heart goes out to those affected by recent #layoffs at several companies (specially @the bird company: the process could have been much better).I don't mean to offend anyone, and I feel what those people would be going through, but I believe rather than depending on the job one should depend on the skills and learning because that is the only way to pull yourself out of any adversity.What you can do / What anyone (those not affected by layoffs) should do:‚úÖ  Keep up-skilling or be up for an interview ALWAYS: Do your job. Do it bloody good, however also keep in touch with the market trends and interview patterns and keep yourself up-skilled. A lot of people who reach out to me say that they have been out of touch of Interviews for more than X years and they feel less confident now (even though they are really great positions in their current company). Don't worry, you're not alone. That is where I feel it is not a bad idea to just practice Interview questions casually. It not only helps you brush up on concepts - one bit at a time, but also keeps you in the zone of interview. E.g.: #softwareengineers can have a habit of solving DSA questions daily and brush up system design concepts (a good way is to read different company's tech blogs). A really good way to achieve this is to help some one in their journey by teaching them concepts. TEACHING IS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN SOMETHING.‚úÖ  Build your network:Your net-worth is your network! You might have heard this many a times, but it's about time to put this into practice. You cannot expect to just do your job, be within yourself and expect that things will always be fine. One needs to be aware of things around. Reach out to people, know their experiences, attend seminars, conferences. Building up your connections is a great way to be prepared for catastrophic times where you can reach out to your connections to see if there is any role in their company that might help you. Referrals are still the most preferred way for companies to hire a new candidate. Your connections can also help you with new knowledge and new opportunities where they keep sharing such info over social media (professional one). Linkedin is still the most preferred way to reach out to people and build connections. Also, there are several folks who are offering help for others with resume review, referrals, mock interviews, etc. (Feel free to hit me up for the same). Utilise such opportunities.‚úÖ  This one is kind of subjective, but try to create dependency on yourself in ur project / team:Take initiatives, work on projects that transcends teams, work on side projects, create POCs and generate engagements with team members on the project, create visibility for yourself with upper management. The idea is to take up impactful work that can create a quantitative result.P.S.: These are turbulent times, but temporary.

This week has been a pretty interesting one, given all the layoffs and exiting that has been happening.I truly know the pain of going through this transition, it is not easy and it will feel lonely.

More than the transition, it‚Äôs the emotional stability you have that will come into play.I am available to have a coffee chat, discuss about your transition, skills development, connecting to job openings and help in deciding what‚Äôs next for you, if you need someone to talk to. Please send me a message and we can schedule a chat. #givingback #layoffs #letsconnect #listener #helpinghands #relationships #growthmindset #mentalhealth #hiringengineers #jobchange

Tomorrow is the first day back after layoffs for many. It won‚Äôt be a normal Monday.Transparency for the road ahead is required. There will be questions and concerns. Do your best to inform, engage - and if necessary educate.

In the year 1997, Apple stock was trading at 12 year low and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Many experts suggested Apple to  shut down and return back whatever money left to their shareholders.In February 1997, Steve jobs joined back executive committee of Apple as an advisor and in March-1997 fired 4100 employees including the then CEO Mr. Gil Amelio. This situation is similar to today's mass layoffs by Twitter. Twitter has failed to post profit since long time and now Elon Musk is at the helm.Elon Musk has claimed that he had no choice but to lay off thousands of Twitter employees as the platform was losing as much as $4 million every day.Let's wait and watch !!#twitterlayoffs #layoffs #hrcommunity #hrhiring #hrhiring #sales #management #socialemedia #linkedincreators #linkedincontent

#Tiwtterlayoffs #boycottTwitterAlso #StupidityImagine you buy world's most tweeted company and you see a loss of $4M/day. What do you do? #CutlossesWith funded companies already paying 200+% salaries and mindlessly hiring to please investors and put growth numbers on the borad, this bubble was obvious to burst. And more of these layoffs are bound to happen in #trending unicorn ü¶Ñ companies across sectors. Educated professionals, need to see what value they create and evaluate their career journey accordingly. If you are mere a number in the team, just quit. For all those who are so sentimental about #layoffs, they are paying 3 month salaries and deserving ones will landup amazing opportunities in the future. It's very easy for random #armchairedwarriors to create LinkedIn Engagement on general dissent.

#IPOStartup culture is gaining a very great pace in India.Shark Tank India is also back with its 2nd season, which I think will be a blockbuster, but we'll surely miss one liners & reality checks of Ashneer Grover .Many Startups are now going for IPOs, but ever wondered which are some of the greatly failed IPOs, below are some of them.Starting with G.O.A.T.#1. Reliance Power Ltd.Listed in the year 2008, Reliance Power was also known as the dream IPO of Anil Ambani; this IPO ran very well on the hype wave and took the global market by storm. It was a hit even before reaching the market, and the speculations valued it at almost 190 billion dollars in the local market and also 100 billion dollars from foreign investors. It was one of the biggest IPOs to ever hit the market. But after all this, the IPO listing story was different. Only after a few days of listing did the price of Reliance Shares come crashing down, as if just the name of the company was not enough, nor the tag of Ambani. Very soon the dream run of Ambani's Reliance Power came to a standstill and fast forward to today, the stock price of Reliance Power is down 97% from the listing price. There is nothing more to say after this, there will never be a bigger failure in the history of the stock market.Offer Price: 450Open Price on listing: 547.80Price today: 16.80#2. PAYTM2021 was such a dream run for all the stocks as the markets were breaking records and touching sky-high levels several times. Also known as the golden year for IPOs, Paytm is also a fintech company that launched its IPO in 2021.Many things were blamed upon, for its failure. The extreme Optimism for valuation of over the top of INR 18300 Cr., some said that it's share was way too overpriced, poor performance was also blamed as the reason.Offer Price: 2150Open Price on Listing: 1955Price today: 650.20#3. Coffee day enterprises Ltd.In November 2015, Coffee Day Enterprises came out with a Rs 1,150 crore issue, which was subscribed 1.81 times. The shares dropped over 17 percent on listing day.Offer Price: 328Close Price On Listing: 270.15Price today: 48.90Now, look at the Offer Prices, & Last Trading Prices, like who would have imagined 3 very high profile and huge IPOs would be shattered like this.Now BYJU'S is also planning an IPO of Indian Subsidiary Aakash BYJU'S.After a whole lot of criticism about laying off employees, delay in publishing financials, & recently by onboarding The OG of football, #Messi on it's marketting campaign, what do you think about it's IPO's performance?What do you think is the reason behind falling of these shares?Which are some other most flopped ones that are must to included in the list? Must let us know in the comments.P.s. And then there is Mike Merill, who divided himself into 100000 shares & set an IPO for $1 a share, and sold 16000 shares uptill now & is trading at $6.LinkedIn #stockmarket #startup #flopIPOs #Byjus #edtechstartup #layoffs

In December 2008 during the GFC, I was out of the workforce. The 2008 Christmas and New Year was the coldest one although the average temperature in December in Saigon is 25 degree Celsius or warmer.Draw the support from your family. Spend time with your children. Cook for your partner. Visit your Mom in person. Give your Aunt a call. Make a coffee appointment with your Dad. Have lunch with your University classmate and visit that lake that you procrastinate it for the past 3 years...Thanks to my joblessness in late 2008 and the first half of 2009, I had plenty of time to prepare for the arrival of my second child, then spent all of my time with my new-born daughter since her very first day on Earth.

Sherri Carpineto, as usual l am immensely grateful to be part of your network. You just know how to say the right things. And no for those who might think l am comforted by her words because l got fired, no l don't work at T(s) Sorry...üôèBut l will say this, words are all we have and words do fail sometimes but when people use these words, it is usually genuinely from a good place.You can't understand what one is going through except you have experienced it. You can try to understand but understanding and experience are not the same thing.Even the words * how can l help* may prompt the sarcastic response of *can you give me another job?*.However, it's all coming from a good place. Well, l don't know how absolutely true this is but l often wonder, who would like to see anyone suffer?The logical response would be no one but there's always an exception to the rule.Rather, just offer to help them do something. Shopping, utilities, kids school fees, mortgage.  It would be one less thing to have sleepless nights over. And you will have demonstrated how humane your selfless acts of giving is.

Why are companies laying off workers and hiring for the same roles?Wouldn't it make more sense to reduce hours, offer pay cuts, and or furlough employees over mass layoffs? I'm truly curious. In my mind it makes sense for companies to work with the talent they already have during difficult economic times over hiring and training new ppl. A lot of Employees would rather take a pay cuts for a short time than to be unemployed for months over months. #layoffs #makeitmakesense #helpothers #employeeretention #fired #winwin

To increase employability nowadays, it is necessary to increase professional visibility. Even if you have no interest in finding a new job, keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date is a good insurance policy.¬†Creating a strong profile & building networks take quite a bit of time, so it‚Äôs better to have those done in the event that you do need to look for a new role.My story: Headhunter ran across my LinkedIn profile & emailed me about an opportunity. I had zero experience in the position they were sourcing for. Figured it wouldn't hurt to talk to headhunter instead of replying back with, "No thanks".We talked & headhunter proceeded to discuss another role not published, the one I'm in now :-)#advice #linkedin #serendipity #networking #opportunities #hiddenjobs #opentowork #layoffs

Lay offs are more common terms these days on news and Market as Indian startup has been struggling with dented growth and losses. There is no particular sector but every sector has got hit by some or other reasons Their are several factors for it 1. Russian - Ukraine conflict.2. Stock market crash.3. Supply chain distribution. 4. Raising cost of capital.5. Lack of innovation .6. Obsolete pandemic business model .Lay offs doesn't create a good environment in the job market as when market is not in good phase they cannot absorb the available talent pool vacant on the other hand employers have choices and availability of large talent pool. #job #business #startup #talent #environment #growth #hrbp #layoffs

Perhaps my LinkedIn community can help me understand something.Over the past week, I've seen post after post after post regarding the massive layoffs in the technology sector.- Stripe lays off 14% of its workforce (around 1,000 employees).- Lyft lays off 13% of its workforce (around 700 employees).- Twitter lays off 50% of its workforce (around 3,700 employees).Just to name a few...At the same time of these layoffs and in the same time period as these decisions were being made by upper management, all 3 of the aforementioned companies posted job openings for (what now seem redundant) positions for mid-level to upper mid-level roles. Am I missing something here??According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment returned to pre-pandemic levels in July 2022 and 261,000 jobs were added to the economy in October alone.The job market seems pretty hot at the moment and if these companies are seemingly hiring for mid-level to upper mid-level roles, what is the need for these massive layoffs? It can't ALL be due to inflation because if that were the case, why would the job market be as hot as it is right now?  If anyone can help clarify this for me it would my greatly appreciated.#technology #management #jobopenings #layoffs #techcareer #jobmarket #unemployment #economy #corporateleadership #confused

What's a leader's most important quality?It could very well be having "empathy".In this article (https://lnkd.in/gd6c-YAn), Rachel DuRose differentiates how layoffs were handled at Stripe (good) vs Twitter (bad).It is a great lesson. I would argue not just on how to handle layoffs (or firing) in particular but about leadership in general.Having accountability, transparency, appropriate timing and communication, and even being more business savvy.¬†All starts with having empathy.When you act through empathy, even when making tough decisions.¬†You might get back some ‚Äúempathy‚Äù in return.#leadership #layoffs #talentmanagement #stripe #twitter

Days after huge layoffs BYJU's signed up Lionel Messi as Brand ambasador for Education for all program.I don't find much wrong in this development, you see the main aim for a company is to stay in the market as long as it can survive. These are extreme times, recession is coming and firms need to be prepared for it. Cutting the budgets means eliminating NPAs(Non Performing Assets).This deal was made so that BYJU'S  can moved towards an international Brand. But at what cause‚ÅâÔ∏èI hope this deal would open progressive gates for #byjus so thay it could afford rehiring professionals with the past speed.Tap the link to read full story in the link:https://lnkd.in/dVJe4S8d.. #education #development #brand #layoffs #moonlighting #lionelmessi #byjus #advertising #branding #systemsthinking #employeeengagement

I can‚Äôt say I didn't anticipate that this post would get attention.When you are willing to share your vulnerability people respond to the authentic message.What did surprise me was the amount of private messages I got after.a lot of people reached out privately to encourage, put in a kind word, but mostly to share this has happened to them too.These days my friends in tech are going through hard times.The uncertainty of the market is stressful and stress is what triggers it for a lot of people.If you are in this situation and you need a helping hand, a listening ear- please reach out, I would be happy to support you and remind you- that we are all in it together.Be kind to one another, be supportive and empathetic, and if you see me on the train (yes I made myself go back to the ‚Äòcrime scene‚Äô) - offer a smile.*I have no idea why it's all in bold and how to fix it #layoffs #helpinghand #career #people #tech

Why do startups consistently beat large organisations? üß†A question that may seem trivial at surface level, but when given some thought - is actually mind-boggling. Startups consistently bring home large logos, beating large organizations; at a game where they have much lower operational capital and resources at their disposal. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èVarun Mayya makes a very interesting correlation between Price's law and the success of startups, in his youtube video: https://lnkd.in/gSsqhMdHBut what does Price's Law say?Price‚Äôs Law says that for a growing company, competence is linear and incompetence is exponential. Basically, 50% of the output of an organisation is delivered by the square-root of the total number of employees in that organisation.ü•ïThis is what that looks like on the ground: üéØ100 member startup -> 10 people deliver 50% of the productivity üéØ1000 member organisation - > ~30 people deliver 50% of the work üîºSo even though the overall employee count delta is large, the delta between people who actually contribute is small. The landscape of enterprise business is slowly changing. Enterprises no longer depend on large organizations to cater to their needs. They want nimble and agile vendor teams that can get back to them with ever-shorter TATs. üåçBe a stickler for efficiency! üìà#business #cloud #startup #ceo #cto #layoffs #funding

There is so much criticism on #elonmusk for laying off twitter employees.¬†Here is another side to it and a few points to be considered¬†:Twitter as a company had been losing over $4M/day (can one afford so many employees?)Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required.Elon spoke to all the leaders where in a tweet he asks #paragagrawal one question:What did you get done this week?¬†(A very hard hitting but a fantastic question¬†)He also indicated him that it‚Äôs not important to please people as they will never be happy no matter what you do(Yes they won‚Äôt, as a leader sometimes it‚Äôs important to generate growth and progress than impress people)¬†We all know what happened thereafter.If you take over a company (pay $44 billion for a company that¬†lost $221 million the previous year) with this state of affairs, would you want so many employees and no output?¬†Also a capable and efficient person gets a job anywhere if he/she is capable.#twitter #layoffs #worklife #progress #success #efficiency

It is sad that a person who is the one making headway in innovation with electric cars, space travel, etc. couldn't see a better way out of this. Elon Musk could have made a bold statement by trying something other than #Layoffs . Alas, he didn't. Layoffs, like #vaccines are old solutions. We need to think and try different solutions in the hope of reaching better ones. There is a lot of conversation, and very little action when it comes to innovation. To quote a popular song: "A little less conversation, a little more action, please" #innovation #twitter #elonmusk

On Friday, a student told me she was upset she had to go to school. She refused to do her schoolwork because of this. I replied that I was sorry to hear that she did not like the situation she was in today...but how could we turn the day around? I thought for a second, and then I asked her if she liked herself in the situation. She paused for a bit and then said, "no." So, I asked her what I could do to help her like herself in this situation since we couldn't change the fact that she couldn't go home. She replied, "I guess I could try to be helpful to my friends and make my work colorful!" I loved this interaction so much that I just had to turn it into an inspirational quote photo! #help #change #school #layoffs #education

HISTORY OF INFLATIONInflation is a part of economy and hold important and respectful status. Without inflation no economic policy can be prepared. It has perpetual existence. India holds the distinction of saving and is also deeply intolerant of high inflation. Policy makers in India in general make policies considering savings as a backbone to address future financial uncertainties. Globally history of inflation is found to be mystery and unpredictable. Indian economic history provides evidence that India has faced some severe inflation but not disease called hyperinflation(when inflation rate exceeds 50%) which can cause breakdown to nation monetary system. Global economic histories provide evidence that many Asian and Latin American nations have worse record in inflation than India; it is due to their economical performance in comparison to Indian economic performance. In the year 1923, Germany faced worst hyperinflation in which price escalated to 2500 percent in one month and caused monetary breakdown. In Japan, year 1945 is recognized as a year of economic defeat and economic collapse due to war and nuclear destruction. In this year inflation increases and touched the level of 568 percent. In the year 1947, due to civil war in China inflation rises astonishingly and touched 1,579 percent. In the year 1951 due to war between North Korea and South Korea economy suffered and declined drastically and during the period inflation rate increases and touched the level of 210 percent. In present global economic environment Zimbabwe is facing worst hyperinflation, according to the report of Reuter from Harare that every citizen of Zimbabwe is billionaire with minimum purchasing power. Impact of hyperinflation can be analyzed as Zimbabwe central bank introduced 500 million dollar note which has power only to purchase two loaves of bread. It is been reported that in many African nations prices change every passing day and some time it change hour to hour and it is been reported that it is rising at an annual rate of 66,000 percent. According to the Indian history of economy that in the year 1943 highest level of hyperinflation which India has faced since 1801 was 53.8 percent. This was due to independence movement and famine.Consumer Price Index is the metric used to measure inflation. CPI is calculated by using the price change of fixed basket of goods and services. Currently 299 items are being used to calculate CPI. If CPI is climbing up then inflation is rising.Feel free to follow Aditya H#india #future #power #economy #civil #dollar #bank #cpi #environment #inflation #recesssion #layoffs #finance #education #tech #hyperinflation #economics #china #germany #content

It becomes scary to hear that a lot of people in tech is gettinng fired. As a Latino, I had this feeling every time I got into a new company because of my accent. Many people used to make arguments like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people will understand you‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are not a good programmer because your accent doesn‚Äôt help at all‚Äù After some time, I learned that some people will not always be kind and polite and that my skills is what is more important.

Let‚Äôs talk about US employee rights under the WARN Act during mass layoffs.The WARN Act, or the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice Act, provides protection to workers in the US in the event of several scenarios, including plant closings, mass layoffs, etc.While there are a number of caveats and stipulations, in general, WARN applies to companies with 100 or more full time employees.With respect to mass layoffs, WARN provisions are generally triggered by a mass layoff of 500+ employees within a 30-day period, or a layoff of 50-499 employees if that comprises at least one third of the total workforce.In general, when this occurs, WARN requires employers to notify impacted employees at least 60 days in advance.As seen in the news, employers often fail to provide notice in a WARN applicable scenario. This is due to a clause in the WARN Act which states that in lieu of that notice, employers are liable to provide up to 60 days of pay and benefits to impacted workers. This payment must also be provided within 3 weeks of the layoff.While the decisions of company leaders to layoff staff without notice may be legally compliant as long as severance is provided, I think there needs to be some accountability for executive leadership teams that fail to strategically plan for sustainable talent growth and find themselves in a position where they must impact the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of their workers just to protect company profits. I understand that economic factors and global pandemics are not always foreseeable, but leaders can and should engage their HR partners to better plan for sustainable growth and talent management strategies to prevent the need for massive reductions.Layoffs are tremendously stressful for those who don‚Äôt have cushy exit terms as part of their employment agreement, and in this current economic environment, job seeking is harder than ever. The strain on morale and productivity for the employees who remain after the layoff is also a factor that should not be overlooked.I don‚Äôt share these thoughts on behalf of or in response to any specific employer or situation, but as an HR practitioner who is passionate about the employee experience, I urge the decision makers of every organization to consider the impacts of sweeping staffing changes and strive to execute any such unfortunate reductions in the workforce with the highest level of compassion, kindness, and legal compliance.Employees are not just numbers on a spreadsheet or an expense item on your P&L statement. They are people. People with families and hopes and dreams and lives.Do better.#layoffs #compliance #warn

Day 308¬†Continuing on the Twitter ‚ÄúSaga‚Äù, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aka AOC tried to poke at Elon Musk by tweeting ‚ÄúLMAO at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù is actually a $8/subscription plan‚ÄùThis attracted a response by Musk & another of his big backers in the Twitter deal, CZ of Binance. Musk tweeted ‚ÄúYour feedback is appreciated now pay $8‚Äù while CZ said ‚ÄúFreedom & Free (in price) are different concepts. You can choose not to pay & still use Twitter, or not use at allExpecting to use a tool built by someone else for free is just not‚Ä¶free market. Think all Freemium social/ chat products‚Äù Both replies are courteous & give a glimpse into the thoughtprocess for a paid tier for twitter.¬†AOC, is a known left leading politician & poking the bear for some cheap publicity has often backfired on her in the past while growing  popularity amongst her base. However, taking on Musk may have been a bigger bite than she can handleThis incident got followed up by Musk‚Äôs very public mass-layoff at Twitter on Friday. He also mentioned that offices would be closed & access revoked keeping in mind the safety. This was followed by about 2 days of mayhem on Twitter.¬†So whats, going down at Twitter? Is this new? There is an article that has resurfaced on parts of the internet, it is about Apple firing 4100 people in 1997 as part of a restructuring exercise to make itself profitable. That was about 30% of the workforce of Apple at that time.¬†The willification of a paid service by the left & self appointed ‚Äúuplholders of free speech‚Äù is the typical jump on a band wagon to get visibility too. Without her comments, AOC would not have made it to this post ever. ¬†I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into the politicians free riding for publicity.¬†As someone who has been inside the room on multiple restructuring at small to larger levels, & also been on the outside seeing the carnage with the aftermath I can see its never a good feeling. Its probably one of the worst experiences & memories in my 15 year career.Yet each time we were sure of what we were doing was in the interest of the company, not some team, some individual or even the shareholders, it was the best course of action as seen by the company‚Äôs leadership at that point of time. Hindsight ofcourse is 20/20 & may prove otherwise.¬†We can see with the Apple example how Jobs fired 30% of the company but turned around to high multiples more in the next two decades. So all is not lost & an entrepreneur must take decisions that may appear hurtful in the short term but may payoff in the long run.

A CHANGED PERSPECTIVE amidst recent lay offs.Being so focused on achieving that one NAME to tick it off from your bucket list. And there's nothing wrong in wanting to get that BEST out there: college, company. The BRAND NAME matters after all? Right? Two years back I was on the same line. And I did manage to achieve the BRAND NAME for my resume but not the CAMPUS and Location I wanted, I was furious and enraged too.But being active on LinkedIn and getting a sneak peak from the very people working in the sector and companies I aspire to work in, has made me realise a few things, specially the recent layoffs. But today, I'd like to emphasize on one thing that has been making me question and curiosity that I have.You really are REPLACEABLE. Not for your family and friends, But for a fast moving, business centred organization YOU ARE.Now being a fresher myself, I don't think I've the right knowledge as of now, to comment on how one should work. But I can definitely speak to people my age, or in same line as me.I'm not implying that you shouldn't work as hard, but the work always SHOULD BE FOR YOURSELF. The reasons must be right. Tying your worth to a place, doesn't always lead us far and for long. So, wanting to give your best should also be for the right reasons. I've seen people, even the very best ones in their lines getting #laidoff and it's not even about their performance. May be that's just how profit driven industry works. Give your best, cause you want to and you can. FOR YOURSELF. I don't know much, but I'm sure, certain NAMES do come with a lot of privilege and perks.But it definitely should ALL BE ABOUT YOU.For a college or a company, YOU MIGHT BE JUST ANOTHER CANDIDATE OR EMPLOYEE. But in reality, THERE'S NEVER GONNA BE ANOTHER YOU.So, Satisfying yourself for right reasons, I believe should be the goal. I can't tell if I'm able to justify all I'm feeling currently. But for now I'm leaving it like that. #fresher #linkedin #business #brand #resume #work #people #layoffs #selfworth #brandname #believeinyourself #employee #industry #linkedinpost #linkedincreators #linkedintopvoices #connections

The "Crazy" Man from the West has done it again.Elon Musk, with his adventures into Twitter, has become the highlight of all tech news. So what has he done that's so bizzare?1) The paid verification buttonEarlier blue ticks were given for free to influencers, people with recognition. It served as an identity mark for them but had absolutely zero benefit to Twitter. A platform that's so huge people wouldn't mind paying to be a part of it's elite community.The new twitter verification batch serves more like a Twitter Premium than just an identity mark. With priority messages and posts to longer videos, users have to pay just 8$ monthly to access it. On a platform like Twitter, that would make a huge difference.2) The recent layoffs at TwitterAlthough twitter had been functioning well and growing unhindered, the recent layoffs suggest that Musk isn't happy with the team. Is Musk just playing dictator at Twitter or does he have something in mind? Also it seems evident that Elon, the businessman has a new vision for Twitter. What that vision is, no one knows. Is it the largest social media platform at his free will? Is it the freedom to manipulate and control media? Or is it the beginning of something entirely new?Hang on to stay updated. #team #community #people #tech #socialmedia #media #twitter #elonmusk #jackdorsey #bluetick #layoffs
