I am #excited to announce that I will be attending the international educational program "Employability and Talent Management in the Digital Era - Best Practices | Navigating the Workstyles of the Digital Era: Fostering Creative Ecosystems for a Sustainable World of Work" organised from International Human Resource Management - IHRM SCHOOL 2022 (from West University of Timisoara, Romania) and will be held online between 28 Nov - 2 Dec with 10 universities from different countries (USA, UK, Switzerland, #Greece , Malaysia, Hungary, Serbia etc).I want to say a big thank you to my professor who suggested that I should apply to this program, Mr Achilleas Anagnostopoulos and my Business Administration Dpt - University of Thessaly for taking part and giving us this opportunity.SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE IHRM SCHOOL 2022: The workstyles of the digital era contain new flexible systems of engagement and hiring; cultures of more sustainable, more supportive, more creative, but also more affordable work that not only gives employers and employees a wider platform of recruitment options, but it also suggests an answer to the burgeoning question of what work might mean to individuals in future.

I could tell my story of all that I went through to make it to this day. However, I am not special, my obstacles might have been more tedious than others, I may have endured more than others, however, I refuse to use my struggles to define me. Everyone has obstacles they must overcome in order to gain achievement. The story I want to tell is that God is able, hardwork pays off, determination paves the way, confidence in you is strength and your super power. My story is that I did well because I am here to tell you and show you that I did. I am celebrating. I am proud of me, I'm am excited for me, I am excited for what is to come. I thank God, my family for the motivation, and especially my siblings who made sure I was taken care of each step of the way.

After being selected to attend the National Society of Minorities in Hospitality (NSMH) National Conference 2022 in Miami, Florida, I could not contain my excitement. I didn't know what to expect or what opportunities I should be pursuing. Still, I was determined to enter the space as my full self with an open mind and an open heart. I browsed the career fair for what felt like an eternity before stopping at a table where I was engaged in the most thought-provoking conversation I had the entire time I was at the event. I knew walking away from that table that this could be a place for me to excel and ultimately, somewhere I could be happy.Fast forward to now, I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted an internship offer with General Mills for the Summer 2023 term. This couldn't have been possible without the help and support of the recruitment team (Nancy Qiu, Courtney Glotzbach, Marissa Moksnes, Lindsay Jukua), my family, friends, and God above all. Super excited for what's to come! 😆 #GeneralMillsinternlife #iworkforGenMills #acceptedoffer #excited

Great points to take to heart for transitioning and vets already out. I keep joking that I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. The great news, is that I can focus on finding my passion, or calling and try out new things!I’ll admit, it is overwhelming to scan all the careers, jobs, companies vying for attention and talent. I’m used to someone sending me an email with orders to my next assignment. Don’t be afraid to learn new things, connect/network with old friends and colleagues. Introduce yourself to new people and new possibilities.  Finally, and I’m speaking to myself as much as to anyone else. Take your own advice and be your best advocate. Grow!

It’s been a hectic year. That feels like an understatement to be honest 😂 But in many respects - personally, professionally and for many of our colleagues and clients - it genuinely has. Having relocated our young family down to #christchurch just in time for my wife to have our 3rd (and last!) son, the past few months have definitely seen above-average levels of hectic though. PwC New Zealand - after being so supportive of the move and my ability to retain a leadership role in the CT team - has again generously provided me the opportunity to spend this special few months at home. Paternity leave has been incredible for several reasons - watching Kit, our newest member, settle into the world; seeing Liam (4) and Freddie (2) welcome a new brother with gentleness and love; and seeing my amazing wife Jess Lawson strive (and power) through a Psychology Masters thesis (while breast feeding, parenting and generally holding the rest of the house together!). Similar to 2020, I again find myself #motivated and #excited  as I get set to return to work next week. The macroeconomic outlook for 2023 is fragile (at best), financial market volatility is BACK, debt markets are starting to soften and we are continuing to make exciting investments in our people and tools to bring clients sustained value and insights. Thanks again to a remarkable effort from the Treasury and Debt Advisory team for doing my mahi and see you all next week 👍#team #pwc #parenting Alex Wondergem Brett Johanson FCA Mike Shirley Natasha Donaldson Rajeev Verma Cameron Scott Keegan Robbins Grace Lewis stephanie B.

🧡 BIG smile this morning as I kicked off my first official day as Spare Key's Executive Director. 🧡SO much hard work and dedication has gone into the last three years at this amazing nonprofit, and I can proudly say that I can't wait for this next chapter!None of what we do EVERY SINGLE DAY for families facing a medical crisis is possible without SO many incredible individuals. From our dedicated staff of Alexia Sebesta, Angela Frazier, and Talia Simonett to our knowledgeable Board of Directors to partners, volunteers, and sponsors. I am so incredibly honored to be working with every single one of you to ensure Spare Key continues to help more families facing unimaginable medical crises "Be Seen. Be Heard. Be Found." by donors across the nation!✅ First lesson learned of the day? Post early before the day starts! I took this photo before an 8am meeting and had a plan of what I wanted to say, but my day quickly filled with amazing conversations with Board Members and Spare Key partners. Now it's 2pm and I'm finally getting around to making a post! Yet, I wouldn't have it any other way!#nonprofit #excited #dogood #executivedirector #team

The award helps us to make the most of your time here at Hallam by giving you the chance to reflect on your activities and develop yourself. The Hallam Award gives you a way to collect all these experiences and make sense of them. It makes you more aware of how you’re developing, more aware of how you want to grow, and how to go about it. Most importantly, it helps you to get into the habit of managing your own development. Whatever you do while you're here, the Hallam Award will help you showcase your achievements. Seek out new experiences. Say yes to things, as you never know where they’ll lead. Most of all, have fun!The Hallam Award has three levels: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. At each level, you choose two new Hallam graduate attributes to develop through your activities. You will have 12 attributes to choose from; these have been developed in conjunction with top employers and industry professionals. ❇️ BRONZE AWARDThe Bronze Award is about exploring the range of extra-curricular activities that uni has to offer. Bronze level activities are about trying new things, and could include one-off volunteering, casual part-time work (as a Student Ambassador, for example), or attending a session with an Employability or Enterprise Advisor. Choose 2 graduate attributes to develop, and get involved in activities!❇️ SILVER AWARDThe Silver award is about stretching yourself a bit further, developing new skills and showing a greater commitment to your activities. Choose 2 more graduate attributes to develop, and get involved in activities! Do something new, or show more commitment to an activity you're already doing.❇️ GOLD AWARDThe Gold Award is about challenging yourself to achieve even more. This could include participating in complex or time consuming activities, demonstrating even greater commitment or developing in a leadership role. Choose 2 more graduate attributes to develop and get involved in activities!For all SHU students who are interested for this can follow below link.🌐 Hallam Award Link : https://lnkd.in/e6aP6xvD 🌐 Link: Graduate attributes list- https://lnkd.in/eVp58CV5 🌐 Link: Extra-curricular activities list - https://lnkd.in/eKzAUQQx----#HallamAwards #Bronze #SheffieldHallamUniversity #Masters #GlobalMBA #excited

A budding artist I am certainly not, but this gets the message across to whom it concerns. This Chris Aged 6 sketch really could be the next step for Justine Smalley and I and Smalley Hot Tub Services.We both know alot is going on in the hot tub industry, with several retailers and even manufacturers now shutting their doors. However, we feel as primarily offering engineering services, we fall into a different category. Retail, yes it offers far larger returns initially, but then take into account stock holdings, showroom operating costs, energy being the big one. Justine has been updating our Xero accounts ready to submit the next quarterly VAT return. As it stands, since taking payment systems such as SumUp on, we have astonishingly seen a 1000% increase In revenue since this time last year. OK, we were operating out of our garden at the time, we now have larger over heads, but when we saw that figure it's truly astounding.But I digress, back to this drawing. Pending its review and associated workings, we really could leapfrog onto the stage. Something I know quite a few retailers this year haven't managed!#giddy #excited #anxious #smallbusiness #veteranowned #familybusiness #prestigeawards #engineering #project #tomorrow

Today markes the start of my final two weeks at Gather & Gather. It’s been an amazing, tough, emotion spiralling year back. So many ups and downs, both personally and professionally. I’ve worked with some amazing team members and made friends with some incredible and talented colleagues. I’ve worked alongside some wonderful clients that have allowed me to be the best manager & colleague I could be. Unfortunately this year, I’ve also worked with people that I never want to cross paths with, ever again!!! That aside, as I leave, I will be taking some amazing memories with me, and sadness that I’m leaving some incredible people behind. I’m also so excited to be starting my next chapter in a couple of weeks. I’m looking forward to be working for an amazing company where I can make a difference, and where people make places. More to come.  #team #people #newbeginnings #memories #peoplemakethedifference #peoplemakeplaces #nextchapter #excited

I have to admit that still after 10 months at adesso Nordics I'm sometimes amazed what all we at adesso do. This time it was research rocket software in space! 🚀"adesso SE provided the entire software infrastructure for the “Exp.007/Blofeld” experiment during the MAPHEUS-12 mission in Kiruna, Sweden. The protection of sensor data in spacecraft and in “life support systems” (ecosystems) in space is playing an ever greater role in space research. IT security and data encryption – another area in which adesso specialises – is a crucial factor here." I'm so happy to be part of this journey to grow our team in Nordics and provide also our colleagues expertise around Europe to our customers in Finland. #space #growth #excited #data #security

I am excited to be the new team member of Green Phenix and to work on combating the plastic problem.Annually, 11 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans.To make this number easier to digest: 11 Olympic swimming pools can be filled with plastic entering the ocean every hour.If current trends continue, it is expected that the oceans will contain more plastic than fish by the year 2050.We should not be at peace with this reality and do our utmost best to reduce, reuse and recycle our plastics!Green Phenix is a social enterprise that fosters a circular and inclusive economy in Curaçao. We organize shoreline clean-ups, recycle different types of plastic into new products, raise awareness about the plastic challenge, and conduct research on plastic pollution. In the recycling process, people with a distance from the labor market have the chance to (re)discover their talents and improve their quality of life.We are eager to connect, so don’t hesitate to shoot a message if you are interested or want to join our efforts!#KòrsouLimpi #PlasticPollution #Recycling #CircularEconomy #GreenPhenix #CleanOceans #Excited #NewJob

Are you having fun yet?This week, with clients and myself, I've heard so many "shoulds."I should be better at journaling because that will help me grow.I should constantly grow so I don't get stagnant. I should stand up against opinions I don't believe because that's how we make the change.I should start posting on Instagram about my business because it's how I will get clientsI should eat fewer carbs so I can lose weight.I should be more productive in the morning so I'm more productive all day long.None of these are correct. None of these are wrong. They simply are what they are. You're doing one thing to get the other. Have you considered if you enjoy doing it?And what do you ultimately want? My guess is that it's deeper than what you're presenting.What would be available if you did things you wanted to get the result you wanted?Sounds better than putting yourself through hell, hating the process, to simply get to the other side. Enjoy the #journey. #leadership #life #coaching #fridayfeeling #excited #fun #change #business #support

What does it mean to perform under pressure in the work that we do?Well, what I find, cool is the interpretation of the stimuli and what happens when you're nervous, right? Your heart rate starts to go up, you know, you sort of get a little tan, you get a little sweaty, right? You have expectations of what's coming and we interpreted that as I'm nervous. Now, what the interpretation of excited, your heart rate starts to go. You're anticipating. What's coming? Get a little tense. It's all the same thing. It's the same stimuli except for these Olympics. Adult athletes have learned to interpret the stimuli that the rest of us would say, as nervous as excited, they all said the same thing. No, I'm not nervous, I'm excited!And so I've actually practiced it, just tell myself when I start to get nervous that this is excitement now and somebody says, how do you feel I'm like really excited actually it came from just sort of telling myself, no no this is excitement and it becomes a little bit automatic later on and it's really kind of effect of it makes you want to rush for this rather than pull back. And yet it's the same.#excited #nervous #underpressure #metaoak # #work #personallife

This is what I love about LI.One post leads and merges into another.I find that when you open up and show vulnerability which provides a gateway into new connections and existing network. Kicking the week off with a vulnerable post. Short timeline-Resilience Card 2006-April-Left the safety of the military 2006-May-started as a green hand offshore in Holland2006-2015-Successful career in O&G one I’m proud of2015-Redundant from O&G2016-Started new role-In 6 months I was dismissed, sacked. Not engaging with stakeholders effectively according to the company??2016-Took another role-pay cut of £50k…..Five Zero K from my O&G package.I could’ve easily said no-I knew I wanted to remain in H&S. The salary didn’t cover our outgoings, let alone have a lifestyle. 2018-Started a new role in Waste management, shortly after, Wallop suffered a TIA stroke-Viridor fully supported me and my family.2019-Headed back out to sea with the help of an acquaintance and good contact. 2Yr plan kicked in.2019-Moved from our lovely house to our flat-ReOrg2019-5 Year plan developed and progressing nicely2021-Moved away from O&G-In a role that I now absolutely love Let’s break that down.Redundant-That’s life, no control, one of life’s obstacles Dismissal-Well that was for sticking firmly by my personal values and beliefs. Reflecting back maybe I could’ve approached the situation more diplomatically than I did. Telling the Director of HR that their soft skill/power skills required some development wasn’t the best career choice. (Maybe an F bomb dropped in for good measure)🫣When your asked to change and miss out key findings from a site report, that to me is unacceptable & toxic. I’d be operating outside of the institutes CoC and my personal values. No chance-I’d do the same again.All to reduce capital expenditure and optimise profit margins. Those findings would effect the regional managers bonus incentive. The company were poisonous-I wasn’t going to be the next recruit.I didn’t have the skill set and experience in an onshore capacity that I do now. I do take full responsibility for that, I put our families reputation and belongings on a cliff edge. I wasn’t going to stand there and operate in the way they expected. Reflection-Redundancy was the BEST thing that happened to me and a tough grade bouldering wall to navigate.Life lesson. Your life can be spun inside out if you sit back and focus on the negative stuff You have to persue the dream and ensure your process and performance goals are aligned with that dream.Supportive network is something I think is massively underestimated. I now see the value and importance of it.Being made redundant was a pivotal time/moment and such an important lesson life thrown our way. I am grateful for those lessons and now the route and roadmap points towards 2024. #excited#vulnerability #lifelongdream

Learning is amazing.Today, I learned how to sell an exterior door install.Why is this important for someone in Saas? Because I learned how to speak another customer’s language and I was able to apply my current skill set to the conversation and improve it.I am so excited to take knowledge from any sales conversation I can be a part of and add it to my skill set and apply what I already know.I’m also so grateful for Lowe's Companies, Inc. for always having my back and providing for my family during my time of transition.YES! I’m back at Lowe’s part-time and I am so proud of that.I am also excited that I’ll soon be able to give y’all the coolest news ever regarding my future in tech sales.Waiting is challenging. But when you fill it with learning, it’s worth it.What was something you learned today?#perseverance #persistence #alwayslearning #growthmindset #excited #dreamsdocometrue

Happy Monday's 😁 I posted a couple of weeks ago I was like a big kid with a new toy, well this morning that feeling came back. Lovely coming into London Wall to find our new Armed Forces client brochure has arrived. Looks fantastic and can't wait to see the reaction tomorrow night at a special event! It's great to see the work we are doing to support those in that are serving, have served and their families continue to grow and a lot more to come. So pleased as part of the brochure we could get in the work we are doing with four amazing Armed Forces charities as well. Love the fact we are doing all this because "It's the right thing to do" Big THANK YOU! to my boss Leigh Dunkley DipPFS for your hard work pulling this together and having ready in time. #excited #wechangelives #armedforcescommunity #armedforcescovenant

Last week was incredible and I’ll share more about that later, but first things first. #mondayinspiration We will walk in #awareness  of our emotions, our mood, and our mindset- when the snowball begins, our anxieties begin to swirl, or our patience is wearing thin, we will go to the throne. At His feet, we find renewed hope, perfect wisdom, + unwavering peace.We will be #intentional  about pushingourselves outside our comfort zone- with our vulnerability, our generosity, and how we show up in our everyday lives, knowing that's where faith can really come alive. Jesus will cover the gaps, healing will come, + growth will be the result.We will pray, and truly #believe, for miracles in our own hearts + homes and those all around us. The same God who parted the seas, made the sun stand still, and made blind man see lives within us- we know that His authority is sovereign and His care is supreme in every situation.We will stop #striving for God, exhaustingourselves to earn His affection or reap thereward that can't be earned- grace. Instead, we will delight in knowing Him and letting ourselves be known. Enjoying God is the foundation for a fruitful relationship.We will smile and get #excited  about theincredible future that awaits us- the one we get to walk in one step at a time by embracing the present. We will not worry about tomorrow because our Shepherd is trustworthy, true, and the teller of all time.We are living from love this week- free to be and do and say and operate in the power of the Holy Spirit.Peace is our pathway, hope is our horizon, and strength is the song of our hearts.Thank you Cleerely Stated  for this great reminder.

New beginnings!! 🎉Nando Theessen , our CEO at DevWire  bought a company and I'm super excited and enthusiastic to have the posibility to collaborate with the new team and learn from eachother!

In one year we got from 1 to 9 and now, basically doubled the power!I wake up every morning with an incredible energy and pleasure to work and I m greatful for this! That's because I feel valued and I had the posibility to learn, spread my wings and build something based on common values and vision!

Understand the difference between being a prospecting agent and marketing-reliant agent. Will be great to have both figure out within your business in order to experience massive groth, but if you need a wake up call I’m here to tell you if you’re solo a marketing reliant agent you’ll run thorough your resources before creating a stable income. So start with prospecting first and ad marketing after, not the other way around. #qotd #growinguplearning #blessed #thetopagentacademy #thoughts #purpose #dreams #excited #realestategoals #realestatecoaching #financialfreedom #torontorealestate #torontorealestateagent #canadarealestate #Quotes

A Tale from Africa. Tales we tell each other and from which we learn from each other. Come listen to the stories and tales!⁠⁠A man one day went hunting with his dogs, and came upon a shrew by the roadside. It said to him, "master help me across this swollen stream". He refused and was going to walk by, but the little creature entreated him again: "Do help me across this swollen stream and I will help you across yours."The man turned back, picked it up and carried it across, very reluctantly. It then disappeared from his sight, and he went on with his dogs and killed some guinea fowl. Soon it started to rain, so he took refuge in one of the little watch huts. The Shrew, which had followed him unseen, hid away in the thatch. ⁠Presently a lion came along, and thus addressed the hunter: give your guinea fowl to the dogs, let them eat the birds, you eat the dogs and then I'll eat you!⁠The man was terrified, and could neither speak nor move. The lion roared out the same words a second time. Then came a little voice out of the thatch: "Just so. Give the guinea fowl to the dogs, let them eat them, you eat the dogs, the lion will eat you, and I'll eat the lion". ⁠The lion ran away without looking behind him. ⁠⁠This and many other (life) tales will you hear during our community experiences in southern Africa. Because they are fun, they are exciting, they are special, but they are also educational.⁠#excited #talesfromafricatravel #slowtravel #immersion #tellastory #morethanatourist #communityexperiences #realpeople #realsustainable
