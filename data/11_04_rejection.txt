I had an excellent candidate who passed the first, second, and even the third round of Interviews but failed the final round.Why?She became less engaging!She probably ran out of examples while focusing on the STAR interview format.But who was at fault?📌 The Candidate?📌The Hiring Manager?📌 The Organization Culture?She was less engaging because her passion waned. She became frustrated and tired😪.Tired of the processes, tired of the structures, and tired of the hiring culture.Organizations can still have a thorough interview process and promote a Positive Candidate Experience.If you cannot, Bavarde Talent Solutions CANWe can help revamp your hiring culture. We would help:📍 Reduce Time to Fill📍 Enhance Speed, Quality, and Diversity of Hire📍 Give back Interviewing Time to Hiring Managers📍 Promote Positive Candidate Experience📍 Improve your Employer's Brand📌 Interested in revamping your Hiring Culture?

Behind every success is a series of failures. In this ‘success story’, I talk about how Uptree helped to secure my solicitor apprenticeship and also how to deal with rejections. https://lnkd.in/euHHbXSuDegree apprenticeships are very competitive and some say even more so than Oxbridge. As applications begin to open, bear in mind that you are very likely to face rejections. A rejection is not a reflection of your worth and I strongly recommend having a support system to remind you of this when things get difficult. Uptree is a fantastic organisation to support you with applications. There are events soon at Norton Rose Fulbright in partnership with Uptree that are available to sign up for right now!#degreeapprenticeships #rejection #solicitorapprenticeships #successstory

Still on recovering from a job rejection:Dealing with rejection in your job search can be very difficult, especially if rejection is a typical response. Add in that most job hunts nowadays involve a long, tiring process, and it's common for fatigue to set in. The key to success in this case is to avoid getting depressed by staying positive at all times. As you continue to attend interviews, trust that the right job is out there and will come at the right time, and accept that rejection is just part of the process. Even though it's not fun and the method in which you get rejected may seem cold in some cases, don't let it throw you off your game.As you accept the process, remember recruiters and hiring managers are truly looking to hire you. Keep going. Don't give up. You will land a BIG offer shortly! #jobsearch #rejection #success #resumewriting

Hello Everyone !I am happy to share that today I've rejected in Wipro wilp assessment. I know it's very easy (small) exam which I lack.many people share thier success story on this plateform but no one share their disapproval,And I think rejection is more powerful than success. Because it's makes you more stronger.So please take your rejection as fuel that will help you to crack something very very Big.Rejection is a process of selection !My Mistake,Let's talk about my mistake, so my mistake is that I have not solved previous year questions and I don't do practice question. I've only seen so many youtube video tutorials which I don't digest.One thing I learned in this moment is that *(PRACTICE IS MORE IMPORTANT AS LEARNING AND IT IS APPLIES IN ALL DOMAINS)*So please learn less and practice more.If you fail to visit Dubai for a picnic, then next time keep your dream of going to the Moon.Thank you ! #success #learning #rejection #struggle

Today I woke up with the most depressing email from Google.I got rejected in one of the interview rounds and realised that only practising and solving questions is not important. Rather communicating your thoughts very clearly is much more important.But it was very nice and different experience altogether.#google #rejection #softwaredeveloper #bemotivated

Hi! I’m hoping someone can enlighten me on a part of the interview process I find puzzling. I’ve had several interviews that I thought went well but were not ultimately successful. I have respectfully asked for feedback so I may improve or get a better sense of how I did not fit ultimately with what the company was looking for. However, I just get radio silence. It’s really dehumanizing and in my career I don’t just ignore people or emails. Can anyone shed light on what may be the cause? A few lines would suffice, especially if the interviewer said something like “ don’t hesitate to reach out” etc in the rejection email. #interview #interviewskills #rejection

At my job, I see plenty of job rejections during the recruitment process. Here are five general tips for you, in case you ever find yourself not getting the job you applied to.✅ Don't take the rejection personally. It is hard, I get it, but your application got rejected—not YOU as a person. Thankfully, I've never seen an application get rejected because of personal bias. I can't promise it's the same anywhere else, though. If you intuit a rejection involves personal bias or prejudice, you should try to stay above such small-minded attitudes and avoid responding in kind. You're better than that. ✅ Keep growing. Continue building your portfolio or demo reel. Ideally, aim to have a new (and improved) demo reel every six months. Being stagnant, especially in the creative industries, conduces to professional death. ✅ Allow yourself a healthy dose of self-criticism. Examine your application and look for weak points. Look for opportunities to improve and act on them. I am advocating for constructive criticism here, not belittling yourself. Self-deprecation is just as dangerous as narcissism, and neither will help you improve.✅ Ask for feedback.It's perfectly acceptable (sometimes even desirable) to ask for feedback after a job rejection—especially if you made it to the interview phase of the recruitment process. However, you need to understand that companies may not be interested in providing you with feedback. In some cases, they may even have a policy against giving feedback for liability reasons.Related: Please don't expect a full portfolio review if your application gets rejected during the screening phase. Recruitment is not the place nor the time for it.✅ Remember to be gracious. Keep all communication professional, regardless of the outcome, and try not to burn any bridges. Nobody knows what opportunities may lie ahead. Try to remember that rejection is a natural part of the recruitment process. Learn from the experience and keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone without feeling discouraged. I am curious. What other tips would you suggest?Please feel free to comment below. I'd love to read your thoughts and have a chat about this.#recruitment #job #rejection *The icon I am using was designed by Freepik Company

#Rejectionmails can spread smiles too😊#Rejection is a by-product of moving forward in life and I feel that it’s very important for people to build up emotional resilience to shield themselves from it.However, the way a person rejects you says a lot about their company, their team, and their principles/personality. And I had the pleasure of being let down but endearingly through this email received today (Refer to the screenshot).This post is nothing but an #appreciation for people just like you or I, who put in a few efforts to not only look forward but also make sure they support another women and fellow entrepreneurs irrespective of their genders.Here’s to all superwomen 💪🏼🦸🏻‍♀️ out there. You are not alone. ❤️

It was during my initial days of campus interviews when TA professionals used to say we will "get back to you", every time i was thrilled waiting day and night for HRs call and nobody turned up till date. It was fourth OR fifth interview and to my surprise panel member said it on my face that "you are reject", i was dumbstruck. Trust me on that day i realized the importance of statement "get back to you" 🙂 as it sounded much better than "you are reject" #feedbackculture #jobinterviews #rejection

Today’s Tip Didn’t Get the Job? How to Learn from RejectionHearing “no” from your dream employer can be a real blow to the ego. But it doesn’t have to be. To transform job rejection from a devastating experience into a developmental one, start by remembering that it’s not personal; there are myriad reasons why you might not have been chosen, most of which are totally out of your control. Resist the temptation to romanticize the organization at your own expense. Instead of ruminating on your own imperfection, remind yourself that the organization isn’t perfect, either—it just wasn’t a match. Next, use the experience to sharpen your interviewing skills for the next opportunity. Reflect on what worked well this time around and what didn’t, then tweak your messaging and delivery accordingly. Finally, ask the hiring manager for feedback. Even if you don’t agree with everything you hear, you might gain some valuable insights that could boost your chances next time around. Rejection is unavoidable in your career. Take it in stride.source: #harvardbusinessreview #DreamJob #Rejection #newjobopportunity

Dear rejection, I’m no longer afraid of you. It’s time to stop holding me back.Over the last few years I’ve had some really frustrating habits…😣 Procrastinating and faffing.🙈 Not being visible.😫 Not being consistent.🤦🏻‍♀️ One step forwards, two steps back.The most annoying thing being that I could see I was sabotaging myself… my success…. but I just couldn’t stop myself!Until now.Last week I took part in the Get Out of Your Own Way challenge hosted by Andrea Callanan.Wow💡the lightbulb moments have been unreal!(Not to mention that I totally leapt out of my comfort zone and went live in her group THREE TIMES!! 😳🤣)But seriously, I have realised that my past has been dictating my actions in a big way….10 years ago my husband left me and the kids. Two weeks later I got made redundant.Yep, two huge life changing situations rolled into one big package that my mind had labeled as REJECTION.The fear of rejection has been getting in my way ever since….🤔 If I don’t show up, I can’t be rejected.🤔 I’ll string this deadline out until the Nth hour, because I’m scared of my work being rejected.🤔 I’ll procrastinate and faff, doing all the things apart from anything that could cause me to be rejected.Basically doing everything possible to avoid rejection!I’ve realised that I don’t need to be scared because those moments of rejection in the past have actually sent me in a better direction.💖 After my husband left, I met my soul mate partner.💖 After I was made redundant, I started my own business giving me the flexibility and freedom that I had craved.Redirection NOT rejection 💖(Let’s not mention the time I asked Garry out in primary school and he said no, giving me a punch in the nose as a double whammy… not quite sure what part this plays in everything 🤣)I feel enlightened. And now I understand the root cause of my traits, I can work towards fixing them.I’ve had a conversation with my fear to let it know I appreciate that it’s been trying to protect me for the last 10 years, but it’s time to let me move forwards.My past will no longer define my future.Is it time to face your fears?#faceyourfears #rejection #selfsabotage

Following up from a few month-old conversation. A bit of original interest. I emailed some follow-ups. Didn’t hear back.... of course. So a few more tries of the phone and bingo.

Today, I got a rejection email from a major entertainment company after going through the first round of three interviews, and while it didn't come as a complete shock, I think the first reaction will always be, "What did I do wrong?" What if I had answered some of those questions better? What if I had been more diligent in my follow-up? Then, once you realize that those questions are pointless now, you move on to the next phase; wallowing in self-pity. Actually, I've tried to skip that phase today, but I do think it's part of the process for many of us. Finally, you tell yourself that it wasn't meant to be, there is another opportunity out there where you may be an even better fit. And just like that, you move on... #rejection #opentowork #musicindustry

Rejection is an important part of life. It’s there to help us build resilience. It comes in many shapes and forms, from being picked last at sports when you were at school (this was me all the time!), to not getting that promotion you so wanted at work. This is what helps me when I receive a rejection email for a job I really wanted:1. Take a deep breath.2. Recognise my emotions and name them: disappointment, sadness, annoyance, fear…3. Don’t speculate about the reasons. Rumination does not tend to be helpful.4. Go out for a walk to help clear my mind. 5. If necessary, wait until the next day to start applying again. A good night’s sleep is the best medicine. What are some helpful actions that have worked for you after receiving a rejection? #rejection #jobsearch #buildingresilience
-----------------------------
Having to face rejection hurts a lot, especially when you were hoping that things will finally work out the way you planned them.It's ok to feel sad, but your attitude after that feeling will go a long way to determining your success rate.Having a positive mindset and choosing to keep trying are surely the best attitudes to adopt.🎯Have you ever faced rejection before?🎯How did you handle it?#rejection #mondaymotivaton

From #rejection to #offer .... 🚀Earlier this summer, I gave it my best shot to articulate through personal experiences why I'd be an awesome fit for this role. But even with my best efforts, I had to accept that it may not be good enough to win me the job offer.It wasn't.Asking for help is difficult for me. After I resigned from my last role in late August, I worked hard to network and build my brand on LinkedIn. I waved the white flag and hired Chris Pyeatt in October. I was clear with my unique needs as he was equally confident he could help.I landed a role within weeks thanks to his #connections. Additionally, Chris updated my resume and gave my LI profile some needed TLC.This is the toughest job market I have ever seen. Despite our best efforts as #jobseekers, the competition is cut throat as standing out becomes incredibly arduous even with backed experience. Ask for help. Hire a career coach. Do your homework. I could have waited to make this decision but I knew I had to proactive not reactive.Keep going. 💫

Rejected. Twice, so far. My application to speak at the annual teachers' convention was declined, again. I was disappointed, I cried. I questioned my purpose. I questioned my sanity. After all, I have been on this path for 4 years with nothing to show for it, really. Or so I thought.I did what John Lenhart of Flowcess® taught me. I took a step back and asked, "How can this be good for me?" I thought of an arrow being strung in a bow, it has to be pulled back before it is launched. So #rejection is just the arrow being pulled back before a magnificent launch. Rejection is #redirection.I reviewed the facts: my book has won three international awards thus far. I don't have recurring one-on-one clients (teens) because the anti-bullying techniques that I teach work so effectively in dissolving bullying. The bonus? Raising a child's self-esteem because they feel empowered - they are no longer afraid of bullies. I have connected with wonderful human beings who believe in me especially when I falter. They lift me up (you know who you are - thank you).How is this rejection good for me? I don't have to wait until February to share my work with those who can benefit from it most. I can approach school councils and anyone else who wants a #speaker on the subject of bullying now. Things are actually moving forward, not backwards.When you experience rejection, do two things: remind yourself that rejection is just redirection and ask yourself: how can this be good for me?What redirection story do you have?Connected to anyone who needs my expertise (#schools #schoolcouncils #speakersbureau ? Send them my way please. Thank you!Pic reference: This card showed up for me today. I am on the right path.#bullyingprevention #schools #schoolleaders #speaker #speakersbureau

Didn't get the role? 🚫 Being rejected for a job can really dent your confidence. 😢 Hundreds of candidates I have worked with over the years torturously dwell on being pushed to one side, often missing the bigger picture. No one likes rejection.. but rejection is NOT failure. Rejection is another step towards what could be a brighter destiny or HUGE success! We've all heard the story of Brian Acton being REJECTED for a job at Facebook.. Brian Acton then created WhatsApp, later sold to Facebook 5-years later for $19 Billion. 🤑How about Daniel Ek's story? Yesterday I watched 'The Playlist' on Netflix.. Check it out! SPOLIER ALERT!!! ⚠ Daniel Ek applied for a job at Google.... REJECTED! ⛔Daniel worked out Google's core algorithms and manipulated the results in favour of his employer within 24hrs.  Daniel then went on to build a successful advertising platform... sold for a small fortune then created Spotify!! 🎶 Remember.... Your value doesn't decrease based upon someone's inability to see your worth! 🤩 #success #job #rejection #opentowork #lookingfornewjob #selfcare #fridayvibes

Rejection = Opportunity And if anyone says different, they're lying to you. Every time I face rejection whether it is an idea, a job, or even a post that flops, I ask myself what I can gain from it.The answer is always knowledge. As you have heard before knowledge is power.Learn from your mistakes and your rejections, because it will help you in the long run. It might feel awful in that moment... getting the...."We have decided to move forward with a different candidate."But what can you do different? Should you change your resume? Did you ask enough questions? Were you personable?Take those rejections and make them into lemonade. Keep going!#opportunity #rejection

Welp... After sending applications all over the place for over a year, getting rejected/ghosted more than 500 times and still not being able to find that ONE single first entry opportunity, I believe it is finally time for me to give up. People keep telling me that the first job is the most difficult to land... Never knew difficult was a synonym of impossible.Still don't know how I am supposed to "have experience" when I can't even find a first job opportunity to start getting that said "experience". Goes to show that hard work and good grade don't mean anything in life. Maybe the animation/gaming industry was never meant for me and it was foolish of me to think that I could succeed in art. I don't know... What am I doing with my life anymore?#rejection #opportunity #experience

The question is simple:Why should I give you my feedback if you didn't give me any feedback?I applied to this position more than 6 months ago.

Rejections suck.Want to know of a game-changing way to deal with rejections?Start doing this…Use every rejection as an opportunity to build an additional connection in the industry.Having this connection will serve you well in the future.They will act as someone…Who can advocate for you.Who can provide you with laser-focused advice.Who already knows your strengths and weaknesses.The top 1% understand that getting rejected isn’t something to take personally.Maybe you weren’t a ‘functional’ fit at that point in time.BUT that doesn’t mean it has to be like that in the future too.I recall a former mentor of mine told how it took him 3 consecutive tries to finally land his role at Salesforce.After every rejection, the recruiter came back with valuable feedback.That feedback finally did the trick in his 3rd application.So here’s what YOU can do…Next time near the end of an interview politely ask if they are open to connecting on LinkedIn.Or make this ask using a final ‘thank-you’ email.In 6 to 9 months reach out to them again.Mention what you have been up to and how your skill set has evolved during that time.Let them know that you are excited to apply to a newly opened role and that it seems like a great fit.And finally, hope for the best!DON’T just simply look away after getting rejected.YES, rejection is redirection.But it doesn’t always have to be a redirection to something completely different.Sometimes it just means a redirection to the same opportunity at a ‘later date’.#dataanalytics #dataanalyst #career #analytics #rejection
-----------------------------
No is something I hear a lot in both industries I serve.It's part of the gig. You put yourself out there and offer a service, some people are going to see the value and some people are not. But the no stings a little every time.No matter how many times you hear it. No matter how many times you remind yourself that they aren't saying no to you, that they are actually saying no to themselves, to their growth and the growth of their business, to a new way of thinking -- no matter how you frame it, it's still rejection and rejection stings.Last week I worked really hard on something and this week it got rejected. I always tell myself there's a reason for everything, and I know there is. Ironically, on the same day, my growth coach shared about embracing the struggle and even celebrating it because the struggle is where real growth happens. Everyone who's made it to the top has just had more "nos" than you. So celebrate the no, put it under your feet and use it to take another step in the climb. #embracethejourney #rejection #struggle #growth

I don't have a college degree.The highest level of education I've achieved is my high school diploma, and as someone who's currently #OpenToWork and repeatedly asked to share that information as I apply daily to various positions, it's easy to let that fact lead me to feel 'less than' - unqualified, unworthy, inadequate, insecure.But I love this quote by Francesca Hogi:"Your feelings are valid, but your feelings aren't facts."The fact is, I don't have a degree, and many companies will automatically filter out and reject my application to share my skills and experience with them because of it.But just because I may feel all sorts of ways about that #rejection doesn't mean those feelings are true; because the truth is -✅ I am qualified.✅ I am worthy.✅ I am enough.✅ And, I am secure in who I am because of Whose I am.You may feel unqualified, unworthy, undesirable, inexperienced, inadequate, insecure or any other multitude of un's or in's; but remember:You get to choose how much power you give those feelings.Choose wisely.👑E#mindsetcoaching #encouragement #selfworth #reminderoftheday #faithbasedcoach #faithoverfear

A REJECTION IS A REDIRECTION 👉🏻👉🏻👉🏻👉🏻I had some personal stuff to get through, as we all do, but im happy to say I got through it. Now im back and im better than ever!  One lesson that I can definitely take on from the last couple weeks is : ✨ A rejection is a REDIRECTION ✨ It’s not always easy to look at things in a different light, but it’s worth changing the angle and opening yourself up for other possibilities! 📐📐This is how I changed my perspective: 🙌🏻 Spoke to different people for their POV on it 🔑👉🏻 Looked into why things happened.🙏🏻 Changed the angle and took it as positive thing rather sulkingIt’s not alway easy to find the silver lining, and it definitely takes time so give yourself a moment to breath and take it all in.Onto bigger and better things 🙌🏻Can you guess where this was taken?   #itwasaplanallalong #mindset #pov #rejection #life

How did you know you weren't going to get the job after an interview?As a fresh grad coming in from a theoretical university, my marks were decent enough to get me an interview for an HR internship with the biggest fashion house in SA. Aside from not understanding how to take instruction and prepare for assessments, I had no idea how to work Excel which of course, was the bigger part of the assessment I was given! After spending 30 minutes whispering "wtf" to myself while staring at the screen and laptop, I walked out knowing they were not going to bother calling me back 😂 Please share your story!#funnystories #interviewblunders #fmcgrecruitment #rejection

You got to keep Swimming!Rejection can be painful BUT do not pitch a tent there, do not focus on the pain, focus on the progress, you may feel unwanted, not valued but on the other hand it could be the Universe saying to you, “that’s a wrong direction.”Carrying on when you are not happy can be very heavy but you got to swim don’t stop keep swimming or else you’ll drown. If it’s annoying, color it black and white and dim the lights in your mind give color and light to the things you are greatful for and the path you want to take. Nothing lasts forever, eventually someone will notice your worth and you shall receive what you have been working hard for. Any situation good or bad it’s there to teach us something we just need to focus and keep swimming #focus #rejection #motivation #perseverance #selflove #yourworth

What’s more depressing? Getting a rejection mail or getting no mail at all? According to me, a rejection mail is better than no mail. It’ll give us the opportunity to move forward and focus on areas of improvement. It would be great if the HR team could provide a good reason of rejection for candidates who passed through almost every round, they need it more than you know. How much time it’s gonna take? #hr #rejection #opportunity

I can’t take rejection any more!I really don’t want to hear this anymore. Does rejection trouble you?Rejection hurts, it aches, but if you think you still can’t do anything about it,You are wrong!You can, and all you need to do is change your perspective. Steve Maraboli says, ‘𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗜 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗜 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝘆 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱, 𝗜 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿.’We may ask ourselves, what is wrong with me? We may start criticizing and tearing ourselves  down but 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝗲𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘀 𝘂𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲.And if you have faced a rejection today, wait for it to create the magic! :) #icf #performance #rejection #redirection #change #perspective #realign

I woke up to the most heartbreaking email of my life so far ! 💔I got rejected from Google for the role of an Associate Product Manager. Not just me but my family is also heartbroken.I grew up reading magazines and watching videos about Google. No one from my family ever made it to big tech and I was adamant that I would do something great. When I broke the news to them , there was sheer silence and tears just about to roll.I'm still hopeful and confident. I will work at Google someday soon. I also believe that better opportunities await. 🍀I will work harder and get better at my skills everyday 🍀However, I'm eternally thankful for this wonderful opportunity. I'm grateful that I got an opportunity for an Interview with Google. This is an experience I will never forget and will take these learnings further.#opportunity #rejection #hardwork #experience

Didn’t Get the Job? Just learn from the rejection.Hearing “no” from your dream employer can be a real blow to the ego. But it doesn’t have to be. To transform job rejection from a devastating experience into a developmental one, start by remembering that it’s not personal; there are many reasons why you might not have been chosen, most of which are totally out of your control. Resist the temptation to romanticize the organization at your own expense. Instead of ruminating on your own imperfection, remind yourself that the organization isn’t perfect, either—it just wasn’t a match. Next, use the experience to sharpen your interviewing skills for the next opportunity. Reflect on what worked well this time around and what didn’t, then tweak your messaging and delivery accordingly. Finally, ask the hiring manager for feedback. Even if you don’t agree with everything you hear, you might gain some valuable insights that could boost your chances next time around. Just remember Rejection is unavoidable in your career. Take it in stride. #nitspeaks #hiring #job #opportunity #experience #rejection

Ewok?Or banana?Red Stafstrom 🦁s #Halloween post (https://lnkd.in/eZaGBTsT) reminded me of this picture (of a 🍌banana) I took.I was convinced it looked just like an Ewok!I had a hard time convincing anyone else.𝗧𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻’𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗺.Like hearing the company decided to go with another #candidate.👆THAT is not always a final decision!Remember, no is NEVER forever.Not in business.Not in life.And that #rejection can be your 🪙golden #opportunity.If you didn’t get the job this time – focus on ‘this time’.Because there are factors at play here - I guarantee you - that you’re not aware of.Factors such as:🤔How strong a fit the hired candidate is for the #job🤔How well that candidate will be onboarded🤔How well the #hired candidate will ultimately perform🤔If the candidate even likes the job once they’re in it🤔How many new projects will get spun up that may not be presently on the radar🤔And whether additional #budget will be secured to fund that project and bring on more staffAnd on and on and onPutting on the department head and hiring manager hat🤠 I wore for more than a decade, I can tell you from lived experience that each of those scenarios are ones I have personally seen play out.You cannot know what will happen with the person who is hired.The fact that someone else was hired for a role you applied for does NOT preclude you from being hired for that or any other role at the company.STAY IN TOUCH✔️Send that thank you email and congratulate them on finding their perfect candidate.✔️Let them know how much you enjoyed learning about them and the company and that you hope to stay in touch.✔️Then follow the company here on #LinkedIn, and send a #connection request to the person who interviewed you (if you haven’t already).💥Engage with them. Stay connected. Be visible.And how do you do that? You interact.A rejection can be your golden opportunity to help THEM get to know YOU on a different level -- and it is absolutely a great way to stay top of mind when and if other opportunities become available. Remember – things aren’t always what they seem!And no is never final – unless YOU decide it is.Got get 'em! You got this!https://lnkd.in/eeg2GE7V#youcandoit #yougotthis #bananaewok

He was totally blank. He got nervous. Then interviewer told him to remain calm. He asked him to tell the approach which was coming to his mind. Time was not the boundation.💯My friend start explaining whatever was coming to his mind. "That time his mindset was ki hona to hai nhi. Atleast kuch bol hi du jo dimag me aa rha hai🙂"And Interviewer told him that you are on the right way. He asked him to think a little more.He again started thinking and after a brain storming for 15 minutes, he again told another approach. Interviewer was very friendly. He was impressed with him. 💯Though my friend didn't give the exact solution but his approach was approximate.After that he asked him about the projects.The interview went for around 1 hour.🙌My friend was sure that he will not get selected as other candidates who were better than him were already rejected.💯When HR Provided me the result, I was surprised that he was shortlisted for the HR round.

Rejection is redirection 🔄In 2018 I applied to study medicine at Cambridge. I had my interview and it went okay, but in the end I didn’t receive an offer. I was gutted. I felt like I had let myself, my family and my friends down. I felt like a failure. However, 4 years later I am happier than ever to be studying medicine at Barts! Looking back, I hadn’t done enough research and the Cambridge course was definitely not suited to me (they have so many essays!). Aside from that, if I did go Cambridge, I wouldn’t have started my YouTube channel and wouldn’t be where I am today. The last four years have been the best years of my life, and I wouldn’t have had this experience if I did go to Cambridge. I wouldn’t have loved my course, started YouTube, or helped thousands of students around the country. When I was rejected, I was told “rejection is redirection”. I never really understood it’s significance until now. I was redirected to follow a path that was better suited to me, that makes me happier and that has helped me develop the most as a person. If you are currently going through failure, take your time to feel the emotions, but understand that there’s something even better waiting for you. If you would like to hear more about my thoughts on this topic, watch this video:

Canadian Diary ! 📒Page 2: That’s a Turning point ! Well ! My visa’s got rejected and now I am totally blank. My every type of investments(Physical, mental and financial) will be going to waste just because of the reason of visa rejection I got i.e “I am over educated and I won’t come back to my country( Well , I am not sure how much % people are doing that).”But still I got that question mark in my life ❓❓I was waking up for the whole night for the online classes for 4 months and working so hard for good result and future. My first semester’s fees refund date has been also passed. But now I have no way to go ahead… My agent told me to reapply for the next intake. In that case I am loosing everything..One of my friend gave me a suggestion of generating webform and I make it as a toughest pillar of my fight against my interest of continues learning .. Because I was standing really uniques by all means in class, I requested professor’s to help me and provide me the referral letter. Luckily, I got 3 LORs which are specially mentioned for Immigration officers from my professors. I put all the proof of academic excellence, other active attitude in campus and a strong SOP(statement of purpose).I generated a webform with all these documents on my file that is already rejected and closed. And GUESS WHAT …??They approved my visa within a week. ✅✅✅Learning: “If you have enough courage to justify about your interest and vision, just find a way to represent it as strongly as possible.”Now, I wanted to run for the election for the position of “Director of student experience” in George Brown college. Again a climb in the story …. I’ll be back with one more page soon.Stay tune..

Dear #hr / #recruiter,#cvs, #resumes and #interviews are country, job and culture specific.Everyone deserves full transparency on matters bordering on the issue of jobhunt.Before thrashing that document or rejecting that candidate, be sure to do your due diligence around:💥 Job role requirements. Does it meet the requirements? 💥 Location of job. Can the candidate fit into the terrain, or will it place more financial burdens on the company, and can that position be filled locally?💥 Local laws and #culture of the job need is of paramount importance. Does the candidate satisfy and understand these basics?💥 Is the candidate overqualified or under qualified for that position, and is there any possible remedy, especially if s/he meets your brand needs 💥 Salaries and benefits. If the #jobseeker is what you need and is asking for a higher rate, can your budget accommodate it?💥 Is the cv, resume or person trying to use lies to cover up employment gaps, instead of being honest about it?💥 Are there inconsistencies with #careerpath...many, quick and short moves, transitions, one too many? Possibility that this person may leave quickly too. 💥 #Rejection shouldn't all be about the employer's credibility. What about the candidate's #mentalhealth and career trajectory. 💥 Always put on your dignity, respect and empathy cap during recruitment and selection processes. It makes you more human. Whatever the sign, don't be too hasty to reject candidates. If you see that s/he could be a potential hire, seek more ways to get additional information before the final decision. Finally, in the words of Alesha Jain, "Every master was once a beginner...who decided not to give up when the going got tough."It's in you...success!It's me...Incurably Optimistic Esther😇🥰📸 Happy Friday!! #recruitment #cv #job #resume #employment #jobhunt #interviewing #hr

The concept of transferable skills will always fascinate me. For instance, I used to sing opera professionally. I had no idea how much that would prepare me for the sales role I have now. It gave me quite a thick skin for rejection. I still don’t like taking losses, but looking back, I sure am grateful for the ones I took in those audition rooms.  #transferableskills #sales #grateful #rejection #60in60 💪🏾

My last post about my experience being #laidoff connected with a lot of folks! I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised given the state of the #jobmarket, but I am not used to that level of engagement 👀Many of you thanked me for speaking #candidly, but even more of you reached out to ask for tips and/or support because you are #struggling too. I have 2 tips to share, I’ll post one today, and one tomorrow 🗓Tip # 1️⃣ for a seemingly-never-ending-job-search-that-makes-you-feel-like-giving-up:When you are feeling down, or when you get yet another #rejection, take a break from the #jobhunt to do something YOU know you are amazing at. I did some simple paper folding. It's meditative and repetitive and I like to make pretty, symmetrical things. Other things I am really good at include sorting & organizing, making friendship bracelets, and finding deals at thrift stores. 📌Important note! I am NOT talking about trying something new. I am talking about you doing something that you ALREADY know how to do and are really good at. Even if you haven't done it in years! Trust me, it is not a selfish use of time. It's important work.💡You could play your fav video game, do your makeup, make pancakes, organize your closet, make a spreadsheet about something interesting to you, bake, or spend some time with your instrument..., really, it can anything you enjoy that makes you feel super-competent and like you are #crushingit.Remember, you know what you are doing, and you are a #talented, #unique human with a lot to offer.#tips #morethanwork #confidencebuilding #sharingknowledge #itsthelittlethings #confidence #creativitymatters #experience #process #affirmation #youarenotalone #youareamazing

I've learned about perseverance: when you hear the word 'No,' and when you hear #rejection, it's not always final. Timing is everything, and you have to stay the course and keep working hard and know that when your time comes, it will be sweet and that it will be a perfect time.

Yesterday I got this email rejection from an Events company here in Milan. I can’t figure out what’s in the mind of the person who wrote that email. I have been looking for an internship for months and rejection is part of my daily life but receiving this kind of email made me wonder what kind of companies are in the market and how are they allowed to treat a candidate like that. I’m sure it says more to me. I would never work in a company with no values like this one. And I am sure there are many companies out there worth the rejections.Btw. I did fit the description.  #work #internship #rejection

Dear brokenhearted,Being betrayed, hurt, disappointed are deeply unpleasant experiences. The rage of anger can lead you to do all manner of things. You habour resentment for a partner, a colleague, a friend. Hoping and wishing to inflict twice as much pain to them. You can even extend this to their possessions that they value dearly just so that they can feel what you felt. I have found that such quests of revenge is actually like seeking healing from the very person that hurt you. Healing in the sense that you want to transfer the hurt that is burning inside to the other person. While it may grant you some relief, your revenge episode does not lead you to restorative healing. Hurt, anger and trauma that is not transformed will always be transferred. Today, choose to work on transforming your hurt. How is this done?By surrounding yourself with those who love you and see your true value so that you can lean on themBy acknowledging that a wound has been inflicted and critically analysing the extent of the damageWith the support of others, instead of crafting a revenge plan, you craft a repair and recovery plan; “how do I begin to heal from this?”  When you have lost your job, received another regret notice, when the business has failed, when you have been betrayed by a friend, the greatest impact is to the manner in which you see yourself. Your self view diminishes. Choose today to work on restoring your self worth, extend forgiveness to release you from the command of your anger and then seek to elevate it to an even higher level. Choosing to be happy is about deciding to pursue it before you can possess it. #blowthelidoff #happiness #healing #hurt #rejection #betrayal #restoration #risingagain #forgiveness #wellnesswednesday

AndI continue doing things that I am passionate about …- I share my personal #ImmigrantStories to motivate my #immigrant friends.- I make jokes and write fun content to bring positive energy (we have enough negative news circulating around). - I support my #LinkedinCousins by liking and commenting on their posts.- I continue working on my new business to help international students and immigrants (coming soon!).- I prepare to launch the Verso Talk Show Program which aims to bring more visibility to successful #ImmigrantLeaders stories. AND- I keep growing my #LinkedinNetwork! *I aim to hit 20k connections in the next few weeks! 🚀The lesson? Resilience, revenge and perseverance is the best success, especially when you realize that you are capable of achieving impossible.  ** To all who want to hear this: Don’t let rejection define you, and stand in the way of getting what you deserve in life. “No” doesn’t mean never! Rejection is not always final. Rejection is redirection. And (maybe) one day “they” will be pining after you! 😉——————————————-#AspiringAytakin #LinkedinCreator

It has been 4 months since my original post....I started this journey on LinkedIn and I wanted to end it on LinkedIn. Today I heard back from Stellenbosch and I was not accepted to study medicine.I will never regret trying, it is always important to try, the worst someone can say is no. To the class of 2023 best of luck, I know you will make amazing doctors.For me, I get to keep doing a job I enjoy, travel and look for new dreams and adventures. I would be lying if I did not say I was deeply disappointed, but somethings are out of your control and you need to accept that.#itwasano #rejection #findingnewdreams

You are not weak if you have been rejected from a job!You are not lesser than others if you are rejected.You are not a poor candidate if you are rejected.Rejection certainly does not mean that you are not capable enough or that you cannot improve yourself.While rejection can be tough to deal with, people often make the mistake of thinking it as the end of all things.In reality, a rejection can actually mean that-👉You might not be fit for that particular job👉You might not have the required skill set for the job👉You might be better suited for some other job role.Most importantly, rejection is a learning opportunity... It’s an opportunity for improvement and an opportunity to become a better version of yourself.So if you are someone who has recently faced rejection or is afraid of being rejected, remember that Rejection can be an underrated opportunity.How do you deal with rejections?...#rejection #job #interviewtips #careercoach

Beyond excited to announce the acceptance of our submitted translational research manuscript to the American Journal of Transplantation (AJT), as the First Author.- In this manuscript we identify: 1) Pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of endothelial cell PI3Kβ protects the transplanted heart allografts from obliterative arterial vasculopathy in mice. 2) Selective graft endothelial PI3Kβ  loss of function prevents display of the chemokine CX3CL1, and adhesion molecules such as ICAM1 by the graft endothelium, and markedly reduces graft arterial inflammation in vivo. 3) Tumor necrosis factor elicits PI3Kβ activation in the endothelial cell. Pharmacologic or genetic PI3Kβ inactivation of human or mouse primary endothelial cells blocks TNF-stimulated CX3CL1, ICAM1, and VCAM1 expression. This is surprising since earlier work using pan-isoform inhibitors did not identify a role of PI3K activity in regulation of these TNF-stimulated NF-kB-dependent responses. 4) Mechanistically, PI3Kβ inactivation blocks IkB degradation, and NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation in human and mouse endothelial cells.   Our findings identify a novel mechanism of pro-inflammatory molecule regulation in endothelial cells. Further, we demonstrate that a re-purposed PI3Kβ inhibitor compound, trialed in humans, effectively blocks vasculopathy in the pre-clinical transplant model. These findings suggest PI3Kβ inhibitors may be broadly useful in other clinically-important vascular inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and autoimmune vasculitis. #research #american #journal of #transplantation #vascular #biology #translationalresearch #transplantation #rejection #biotherapeutics #biomarkers

hey #connections, I am unhappy to share that I was rejected by Google and Trilogy Innovations and at the same time, I am feeling proud that from "taking 4-5 hours on easy GeeksforGeeks problem" to reaching the last round of Google and Trilogy Innovations interviews. it's a beautiful journey to date.the learning I got from these two rejections,1. Luck plays a big role.2. Speed matters a lot.for the first point, I can't do anything but yeah for the second point I will work on it and will come back stronger. In the end "I will keep trying until I succeed"I would like to thank my seniors Nipun Aggarwal, Arsh Goyal, Shailendra Jain, and Kushal Vijay for guiding me through the journey.and I would like to thank my friends Utkarsh Tiwari, Tushar Lalawat, VIPUL CHAWLA, Mamta Leel, Ashok Kumar Meena, MULAYAM SINGH YADAV, and Sawan patel for keeping me motivated throughout the journey.#google #trilogy #interview #rejection #recruiters #dsa #learningexperience

So, a decade ago I used to work as a Patent analyst reading thousands of research data in Excel, per day. This took a toll on my eyes. When chasing ambitious exciting deadlines every week, slowly my health, sleep-patterns, all were destroyed. The more I burned at work, the fewer time I had to take care of my relationships. Then, I got a PhD offer in a fancy European country, thinking my days will be glorious from now on. I was full of self-doubts and fear from past failures (I didn't focus enough on my accomplishments), so even if I had enough supports to come to top USA universities, I constantly doubted myself.Unfortunately, the smart hyper-energetic mindset that I and my bright team-members in our early 20s had in that job position, was absent in the PhD group I landed up in.By that time, I was a pro in excel and can use it far better than Matlab or C++ for analyzing large datasets. So, when I tried to find patterns in optical structures performance, I chose excel instead of MATLAB(which was outdated in that research group and I was not good with the syntaxes in the older version). The goal was to see if there were statistical correlations that can help me predict limits of  geometric shapes used in those optics experiments and in case there can be statistical patterns found from it.Unfortunately , the people in that PhD groups were not remotely as well-informed in the area of advances in Electrical and computer Engineering. They were very good in doing manual labor that is essential to succeed in experimental labs, but they lacked my academic depth that we have to go through in top Engineering programs in India.But who would listen to a first year PhD student full with trauma, crisis and self-doubt?My idea to find patterns in photonic structures and optical experiments to check limits of nanosizing them was mocked as "fraudulent research practice" with severe efforts to destroy my career.Being a well-read, openly ambitious, outspoken and  assertive I got many victories in my life, along with some very bitter enemies. When I had my fall, my imposter syndrome amplified, so did rejections, betrayals, humiliations, frenemies. I got a first-hand experience of double-standards in society that is not willing to provide gender equity in high-growth STEM field. My health got destroyed, career was in ruin.I have come a long way to overcome those trauma while recovering my health.  What I thought 9 years ago, has become norms now in many top research groups led by scientists with diverse backgrounds. 1)https://lnkd.in/g6HiAevr2)https://lnkd.in/gBBM3B-zNow I have many projects going on, many rejections every day. But I learned to stand up for my skills, knowledge. I have found means to deal with Imposter Syndromes. But most importantly, bullies do not tear me apart anymore. Learning to deal with Rejection is a very underrated skill.  It starts with self-care.#impostersyndrome #rejection

I shared this on Facebook and thought I would share on here too. A loving message to those of you who are running your own businesses, especially service based. When you want to serve and help as many people as you can. The messages, the requests for help, the rejection, the ghosting, the challenges and different roles you play each day. Remember you were born good. ⬇️ You have passions and gifts to share. I know it can be really challenging, income being inconsistent and quite volatile at times, as well as investments like systems, training, tech / va support and masterminds. Spinning so many plates in business as well as personal ones.But if you feel it deep down in your core. This is a reminder to keep going. But keep going on your terms. Remember you can change course if it doesn’t feel right. Also remember to focus on one thing - it’s hard for some of us - believe me I know. But truly give one thing 💯 focus and it will gather momentum and you’ll see the results. If you are coming from a place of service and you are sharing your gifts to help others also make sure you charge the value and worth that feels good to you energetically not what someone else says that they can afford to pay. It’s your business, your service, your investments, your tax bill. Work out your investment / pricings and stick to them. Be consistent, confident and certain on your service. Have faith in yourself, if people don’t get back to you or ghost you after asking for your help or downloading all your free stuff.That’s okay. Don’t take it personally.Follow up with them to gain a yes or no. If it’s a yes then Great, if it’s a no - thats good - let them go and then tune your energy in to serving your next potential customer. Its all good either way 🙏“You were born good” #business #energy #people #dailystoic #gifts #keepgoing #intuition #purposedrivenlife #faith #coaching #beliefs #rejection #boundarysetting #selfcare #selfawareness

Today I want to talk about the emotional side of the job search process.The reality is, there are moments along EVERY person's job search journey where there is a sense of hopelessness or frustration. And if you feel like that, you are not alone. So how do you overcome those moments of self-doubt?  In order to answer that question, I asked my clients who have all gone through that exact same journey and whom I thought would be the best to answer that. I am so grateful for their responses:🌼 Focus on the things that you can control. Job search results can be really random. It is impacted by many factors that are beyond your control. So instead of focusing on the negative, focus on every victory, every successful interview, and positive feedback and notice how much you have improved.  🌼 Tell yourself it’s temporary, learn that rejection is redirection, and cultivate a mindset that when one door closes, three more will open. Also, remember that you only need 1 yes and 1 offer. 🌼 Take breaks away from your job search to reset your mental, physical and emotional health. This is essential to help you reset and relax from high-pressure situations so you can then rationally evaluate what could have gone better and truly improve.  🌼 Don’t second guess yourself after rejections. Every company has different expectations for the same role. It’s important for you to find a good fit with the company in terms of skills, culture, and work. So try to seek that alignment during interviews. 🌼 Develop a support system. Whether it is a friend, a family member, or a coach, having someone who understands what you are going through, holds you accountable, practices with you, and motivates you is vitally important to help you keep going in rough times.  🌼 Finally, remember It’s okay that you are still in the process. It’s okay that you still get rejected. It’s okay that you haven’t landed a job yet. As long as you are continually improving your resume, finding opportunities, networking, interviewing, etc., you will get there.  Even handling rejection better counts! If you feel you’re doing better than yesterday, you are making real progress, which will eventually lead you to what you deserve. I hope the advice is helpful! Keep swimming and you are going to get there! If you need help and support, feel free to reach out. You can also join my newsletter to receive more in-depth career tips (link in comments) 👇#jobsearch #productmarketing #careerintech #rejection #mentalhealthmatters

You are right where you are supposed to be… 🫶🏼After months of “quietly applying,” and interviewing with some amazing companies… Last week I was notified, that the final, one-and-only company I was interviewing with, decided to move in another direction.They decided to PIVOT, as did I. God keeps sending these reminders that I  am exactly where I am suppose to be and doing exactly what I am supposed to be doing. ☀️ I am supposed to be pouring my passion into my clients, and guiding them to lead and live the life of their dreams.as opposed to being distracted with interviews, follow-up communications, or rejection notifications. ☀️ I am supposed to be spending my every waking moment teaching my daughter how this crazy thing called life works.as opposed to dropping her off at daycare for someone else to. ☀️I am supposed to be relaxing and laughing in the evenings with my husband. as opposed to sitting on a zoom call or commuting to and from the office. ☀️I am supposed to be readily available for doctor and vet appointments, trips to visit family in the middle of the week, happy hours with friends, or a random run to the grocery store to grab whatever we need.and I while I was bummed, to say the least, I am exactly where I am supposed to be and my true “dream job”… is right here in front of me 🙏🏼❤️#rejection #dreamjob #workingfromhome #pivot #success #mompreneur

How is a 2-year CV gap for:🗺 traveling 🗺 recovering from a bad work culture and simply resting🗺 taking a break to focus on your passion Less significant or more repulsive than:👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 maternity/paternity leave?Don't get me wrong, I'm a parent myself right after a maternity break. Yet I've seen and experienced in the past, candidate rejection by a Recruiter/HM/Client just based on a career gap other than parenting. Uncertainty? Fear of losing a good worker for traveling? Perceiving them as lazy? 🤷‍♀️Important is different for everyone. I don't really think that a career gap is bad, no matter the reason.Any examples/arguments/weird stories?

A 'No' does a lot to everyone.Our response is generally in one of the five given points:1. Denial - This is the most common reaction  to rationalise an overwhelming emotion. It is a defense mechanism that blames everything keeping yourself feel right.2. Anger - There is a pain in loss. A rejection can wear off a person's emotion and make them angry. 3. Bargaining - Trying to better the processes. Evaluating the wrong doings and making minor changes in the way things are perceived.4. Depression - A constant rejection can lead to depression where you lose not only an opportunity but self belief, confidence and hunger to come out of it.5. Acceptance - When a proper feedback is given, candidate generally accepts it with grace and learns from it. This is where HR should make sure their interview processes should have weightage given on feedback.Share your thoughts..#rejection #no #hr #knowingyourself

Take a moment to really let those words sink in for a minute...It is odd why we tend to "rush" towards every opportunity, thinking that every opportunity is a GOOD one.Maybe that is our inner fear of missing out? #fomoAnd why are we quick to react NEGATIVELY whenever things don't go according to plan? Why do we automatically think a detour is BAD for our plans or life in general?I believe it is exactly this mindset of worrying we might lose out on something which is assumed to be "good", that we add on unnecessary stress onto ourselves, taking on more than we can handle or necessary for our lives, and end up spreading ourselves too thin.Remember my friends, not every "opportunity" is a "good" opportunity.Just because it is there, doesn't always mean it is the RIGHT path for youOn the flip side, whenever something doesn't go according to your life plans, don't be too quick to feel DISCOURAGED or lose faith in the timing of your life.Detours, may sometimes just be exactly what you need, the unseen powers of the Universe, slowly directing you towards your true calling ✨Have a relaxed and productive Tuesday everyone 🍹Truly,TrishYouTube: https://lnkd.in/gtumtyuInstagram: https://lnkd.in/gdVGNQ-6Twitter: https://lnkd.in/gXkwH4bxLinkedIn: https://lnkd.in/gUi6nqikWebsite: https://www.trishandco.com___#trishlee⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀#foodforthought #thoughtoftheday #inspirationalquote #thinkbetter #deepquotes #deepthoughts #deepquote #opportunities #rejection #rejectionquotes #rejections #rejectionsucks #changeyourmindset #changeyourthoughts #changeyourperspective #lifeiswhatyoumakeit #mindsetquotes #lifequotes #wisdomquotes #overcomeyourfears #findyourpath #staythepath #staythecourse #trusttheprocess #trusttheclimb #trustyourintuition #trustyourpath #goodvsbad

Why do people believe in astrology?Did you know over 60% of India's population believes in taking big decisions or avoid certain situations in life after discussing about it with their astrologer. Whether astrology, tarot readings, predictions are true and real or not, I believe here's the psychological reason behind people (including myself btw) having so much faith in it. The one word to describe the reason is ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.Let me explain.If you go to your dad with a sad face, imagine the most predictable series of events following that.Your dad may ask you what's wrong. You may not say anything because you don't want to worry him. He may ask again. You'd either say nothing or briefly tell the issue. And ultimately, your dad would either move on from it with a little piece of advice OR yell at you saying these aren't things to be bothered about, you don't know what real issues are, this doesn't make sense etc.Now imagine going to an astrologer with a straight face. Without even you having to say much except your birthday and time, the astrologer will say things you've probably been longing to hear. "There's deep pain inside of you", "Your relationship with xyz has caused problems in your life", "There's alot of scope with your future, you just need to put in the effort", here's what you do......You see what just happened, whether the predictions made by the astrologer are true or false is a completely secondary thing, but in that moment, what makes you believe in him/her is the fact that there's someone acknowledging that I'm going through something and the reason for it is someone or something else. Have you ever seen your parent go to an astrologer and ask them, Guruji, is there something I can  improve in myself to better my relationship with my child? NO. They'll always ask, Guruji, why is my child so problematic, what should I do to make him better. Guruji will say, do this or tell your kid to do this and he will not trouble you anymore.You see in this situation too, its the instant  acknowledgement the parent receives of not seeing the problem in themselves but the child. So here's my distorted view on it, maybe if we start acknowledging people's feelings and give them validation atleast till the extent of making them feel heard, the need of wanting to see whats right or wrong in our suns and moons would decrease?What do you think?P.s- I'm a huge believer of astrology and honesty have an unhealthy obsession with it hahaha!#astrology #peoplemanagement #acknowledgement #india #empathy #rejection #kindness #peoplehelpingpeople #validation #thoughtfulthursday #thoughts #peoplematter

Your post has not been chosen for further distribution.Your article has not been selected for curation. Your application has been shelved. Your job offer has been rescinded. Life is full of rejections like this. Large ones and small ones. Each one of these impacts our lives to varying degrees, and this often seems to come when we're already up to our neck in stress, already feeling beaten. In Napoleon Hill's 'Think and Grow Rich,' a man gives up on his gold mine and comes to find through the next man's success that he had stopped digging 3 feet from the vein. In this man's case, it turned out to be a powerful lesson and a redirection to even greater success selling insurance. How do you handle rejection, defeat? Do you stop digging 3 feet from gold?Yesterday I saw a post so similar to one of mine that it could have been copied, or at the very least, its sentiment stolen and distilled. My post got 7 likes, this one now clocks over 1,200. I can hardly accuse this person of stealing my idea, because given my grim distribution these days, he probably didn't even see it. So I'm going to take it as a sign that I'm on the right path. My content is gold. It's my mindset that needs help. I keep giving up. I did it here a few years back when I left LinkedIn. And now I am doing it on Medium for similar reasons. I need to cut it out, and if you see yourself here in this state, you need to cut it out too. As a whole, us creative types are not known for our grit. The stereotype of the flaky writer or artist exists for a reason, and that reason is a difference as simple and succinct as the left and right brain. It isn't talent that separates the successful writer from one who fades into obscurity, it's grit and the ability to pull from the logical part of the brain to promote your work through marketing and yes, consistency. This is how the Edisons of the world get ahead of the Teslas. Your ideas are gold. Don't let defeat be the weak link that keeps it from being discovered. #defeat #rejection #failure #grit #tenacity #selfimprovement

Let's talk about job rejection! It doesn't feel good. It feels like bee stings. But when you get rejected from your dream job, you think your life has come crashing down before your eyes. You think you will never get that one call or that one break you've always been looking for. The crushing agony you felt when you were rejected. No one can understand it. No one, truly.However, recently, something different happened. I experienced the most human job rejection! It was my very first international job interview with my dream organization. The team is one of the best in the world. I was so excited to be in the process. I canceled my long-planned trip when I received a call from HR! I successfully faced it with lots of anxiety, then got the call for the written exam.Most comms positions ask for 360-degree support; in the written exam, you will have questions from social media management to content creation. But that question was one of the finest questions I have faced. It was very well articulated and to the point. From the questions, you can easily guess what the recruiter wants; they are not confused at all.Then the viva. Big day. It was a 30-minute interview; to me, it was a calm conversation between two people trying to find common ground.That's it! Weeks passed. I thought another typical recruiter who ghosted me. But guess what? They reached out to me and sent me a long text explaining why they did not choose me. Their words were full of compassion and uplifting.Yes, I got rejected from my dream job; I was close to getting into my dream team, but maybe I will never get another opportunity. But to the Recruiter, to the Manager -Who gets back to us after a job interview, supports our career growth, and always guides us for better development. It may be small talk or small text-but it helps us a lot. Thank you.#job #interview #rejection #communications

Rejection hurts. It hurts to say no, certainly, and I feel for a cat - I do. But it also hurts to be rejected. My experience is that real talk is optimal (as opposed to blowing people off, ghosting them, not returning calls, etc.)For one thing, if you have a penchant for the aforementioned parentheticals, it seems to me that on some level, you'll always have a low opinion of yourself for not having been candid, and immediately matter of fact.In other words, say something. Hopefully, you have the humility to know that your individual limitations might preclude your completely understanding and appreciating what another has to offer. So you know it's you...See, feelings matter, and it's always in part about feelings. Feelings, and etiquette. And what can be the best feeling is knowing in no uncertain terms that you are not left hanging or in doubt...#interviews #clarity #communication #empathy #rejection

There is no doubt that it takes an exceptionally strong heart to accept rejection and failure, but it takes a very strong heart to overcome failures in order to achieve success. Despite the fact that I have been rejected several times by the several companies, I have never lost faith that I will succeed in the future.#future | #success | #rejection | #failure | #accept | #determination | #persistence | #strongheart | #determined | #motivation | #goals | #ambition | #dreams | #believe | #dreambig | #positivevibes | #positivity | #instagood | #instamood | #life | #fail | #SubashPalvel | #internship |

I remember when I received my first rejection email, and I bawled my eyes out. I was so disheartened;  my mum had to beg me to eat 🤣.After a couple more rejections, I have learnt that rejections are a natural part of our lives; they redirect and prepare us for new opportunities. Rejections also indicate how hard you're trying. It is proof that you stretched yourself and sought to widen your horizons. Therefore,  if you do not have a record of rejections, you're either not trying hard enough or not dreaming big enough. Although rejections might help us pinpoint our areas of weakness or help us restrategize, they can also be quite painful, especially if you worked very hard to land a particular opportunity. There's a heart-wrenching feeling that comes with receiving an email that says, 'We regret to inform you...' So, how should we handle rejections ?🎯You are only human; feel free to cry if you must. 🎯Try again and again. If you give up today, you might miss tomorrow’s opportunity. 🎯Allow the rejection to motivate you to improve. In other words, if you need to earn any credentials to qualify for the job, do so. 🎯Ask for feedback if you can. 🎯 Stay optimistic and do a self evaluation 🎯Talk about it with a trusted friend📍Taking rejections personally, believing that you are not good enough, overthinking it, and self-rejecting from other opportunities are all unhealthy ways to handle rejection.At the end of the day “𝘓𝘪𝘧𝘦 𝘪𝘴 10% 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 90% 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘪𝘵” ~ 𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘚𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘰𝘭𝘭 . Please share your thoughts on this matter. I wish you a joyous weekend 😊!#rejection #job #opportunity #personaldevelopment

The new Era of recruitment..Remember there was a time when a candidate had to go to the cabin of HR with their resume. Oh, I am sorry! We are not that old atleast, but this is how Bollywood movies showcased it.I still think those were the golden days, it was bit difficult to get hired but the rejection was so instant and smooth. It was mainly a one or two days process where HR used to look at the resume and ask a few question and then emphasize to come next day in order to know the result. The new Era of recruitment is way more different. Everything is digitalized, they post the job openings on internet, which is absolutely the best thing to happen so far. But the rejection process is lengthy now, first they will go through your resume then ask few additional questions in the same application which might already mentioned in the resume. Then you might get a call and then 2-3 rounds of test will be conducted. After clearing all these levels you need to face an interview which will ofcourse more dramatic than "Kaun Banega Crorepati".And interview will close with the *We will let you know the results soon* statement. And then only in next 3-4 days you will receive a mail of your rejection.Just because of this I feel like those were the golden days.🤣#interview #hr #recruitment #hiring #rejection #candidate #selection #goldendays #digital

This is important at work and in our personal lives. There are only 168 hours in a week. Ideally, 56 hours are for sleep and 56 hours for work/commute. That leaves us with 56 hours for family and ourselves.If you have goals you want to reach, run a small business, go back to school, help the kids with their homework, or attend a sporting event to support your favorite team, those activities pull hours from the 56 left for the week. Other things like watching TV (Netflix, Hulu, Disney), scrolling through social media and creating content to post all take time from the same 56 hours.Saying "no" to one thing is saying "yes" to something else.  No overtime and sitting at your desk extra hours can be a yes, to walking the dog (or yourself).Use the time for things you value, bring enjoyment, and reach your goals. No regrets when you run out of hours for the week. No worries, you get another 168 starting 12:01 AM Monday. 😁 Manage the next 168 differently, like a vacation. 🏖 Chris Hogg

Steps to follow after a Job Rejection: Revise your Resume: Make sure your resume stands out, and ensure that it truly reflects who you are and reflects your past experiences.  Address Areas of Feedback: Maybe you didn’t know enough about the industry in which you were applying or didn’t seem very interested in the role during the interview, etc. Whatever the case may be, take the feedback and use it to improve in the future. Practice your Interviewing Skills: If you were rejected because of the interview, focus on the areas where you struggled. Practice makes perfect and will help you gain confidence for the next opportunity. Keep Job Searching: Don’t give up! Searching for a new job can help you forget what went wrong and motivate you to find a new and better opportunity. #DBRecruitment #Moving #Forward #After #Rejection

I've seen numerous posts about the draining process of job hunting, more so about job hunting after repeated rejections. Especially during the onset of someone's career, a period when 'experience' is a word they detest the most. I know, you know, everybody knows, rejection simply means redirection. I'm certain there're a hundred more quotes stating an identical message.But there's something far worse than rejections. Nope, I'm not talking about the people who're waiting for you to accept defeat.I'm talking about those who hope along with us each time we click on the apply button, each time we're called for an interview, and each time we receive a callback. They wait along with us, with dreams and beliefs."Thank you for applying." That's how most rejection letters open. Our face crumples when we read the sentence, and yet those few who hoped along with us wear an optimistic smile, concealing their crumpled face. "The next it is," they tell us. That moment is much worse than the rejection itself. But my advice is to keep those moments with you. All of us, maybe excluding a few, maintain a list of people we wish to prove wrong. And it's okay to have the list, it's the best form of fuel for success. But also...Let's keep a list of people we wish to prove right, no matter how small the list is. Don't they matter more than those who're waiting for you to accept defeat? #linkedin #jobhunting #rejection #failureispartofsuccess #family #jobsearch #list #hope #rejected #interview #success #experience #people #job #career #thankyou #listofpeoplewewishtoproveright

My job search routine has been the same for 7 months now. 1. Open multiple job boards, spend 2 hours scrolling endlessly through job posts.2. I’m lucky If I find 1 or 2 opportunities that align to my experience.3. I Write cover letters, email introductions and send my applications.4. Final step is to add it to my excel sheet of jobs and wait for an answer.Out of almost 300 jobs I have not received 1 answer.I know I am not alone and that brings me comfort. I want to share my journey to connect and show vulnerability in this process. We all have very different journeys and that does not decrease or increase our value as people. ❤ #jobsearch #jobupdate #rejection #vulnerability #honesty

All of us have encountered this message at least once in our careers. Rejection and failures are part of our lives and set us up for future success. But how to get out of that feeling of dejection and look at the bright side?👉🏽Ask the interviewer for feedback and work on those points for your future interviews.👉🏽Refine your search- maybe the niche or position you were trying for is not suited for you; broaden your scope and look for other opportunities.👉🏽Upgrade yourself- enrol for courses and certifications that will put you ahead of your peers when competing for the same position. Always look for opportunities to improve yourself.👉🏽Do not take things personally- remember that an interviewer evaluates a candidate on several points and many people vying for the same position.Are you looking for a job change?

The greatest and most inspiring thing you can do is to overcome your fear of rejection. A colleague of mine got rejected from a position he was working towards too for quite some time. He applied and made it known to many of his peers. The reality soon hit that he wasn’t getting the role. A door closed. Bam!Did that stop him from getting back to work and think about his next move? Next chapter? No!The outcome wasn’t what he had expected but his relationship with rejection is a positive one. He lets it nourish him while seeking to become better instead of letting it paralyse him into inaction. You inspire me friend.  Rejection isn’t a mirror of who you are but a an opportunity to become more of what you already have become. Keep pushing and the right door will open. Picture context: selfie after I’ve been told my Starbucks rewards stars were not accepted in the airport in Lisbon Portugal.  I decided to go next door and got the best Pastel de Nata and coffee of my life. Good doors get closed sometimes for more delicious ones to open.  #opportunity #work #rejection

The most brilliant mind in #sales ⬇️Be #grateful for that rejection. Embrace it, welcome it. His post is so spot on, especially in the climate we’ve recently entered into. We can expect to hear even more of that in the coming months. How could you reach your full potential without #rejection ?Having started this rewarding and challenging career in purely door-to-door outside sales, sometimes in dangerous areas, only female, no base pay…“Take this map, and hit every store, door and floor.”Grateful for the grit, hustle and resilience that experience gave me. Because anything that came after that was never personal but rather always expected and understood. Now go get rejected. It’s the best thing you’ll do for your #career

As a recruiter, the college shows me the calibre of its students.This college was an excellent example!We visited GCET Geetanjali College of Engineering and Technology to recruit talented youngsters.Many students got their 1st job and are kick-starting their careers with ValueMomentum!Every campus drive is both exciting and gratifying to my soul!The faculty and the students stood out for their exemplary hospitality; I thank each of you.Sadly, some students who didn't get selected for a job were dejected.I could feel their pain; it was natural.I advised them to look beyond getting rejected from 1 job—life is long and full of opportunities.Your talent and capability will shine everywhere.After all, rejection is a redirection towards better chances.You will get many jobs in life, don't lose hope.Onto more campus drives to help people get their dream job! #careers #opportunities #campusdrive #engineering #students #talent #technology #rejection #recruiterlife #valuemomentum #linkedin #alekhyapericherla

Got rejected? Here is how to handle it.It feels bad to get rejected. I won't lie.But my mantra will dealing with rejections have been the same " That if I'm not getting rejected I'm not trying hard enough"Also rejections serves as an opportunity to improve.Got rejected by publishers maybe it's time to improve your writing.Got rejected by investors maybe you have to work on your pitch. Simply put, the secret is to embrace rejection and enjoy it.Sounds odd, doesn't it?However, if you truly desire something, look at rejection as "fun" and a necessary component of stepping outside of your comfort zone.When you turn rejection on its head and think it this way that, "OK if I'm rejected, who cares, at least I tried," you become unstoppable.#rejection #hardwork #consistency #opportunity #growth

Sometimes, #rejection seriously works in your favor. Here's my true story... 😲 Last night I was at a networking event speaking to a friend, and we realized we had applied to the same exact job back in July. She got rejected, while I got hired.She asked what the job has been like, and she realized she wouldn't be happy with it. She wanted a full-time role on a team of other designers, or at least to not be solo. And she had the doubts during the interview on these exact thoughts.But, I work as a solo UX designer, part-time—and it turns out that this is exactly where I'd like to be!She was glad she got rejected because it meant she didn't have to take on this role or put herself in a situation where she would be unhappy.And I'm happy I got rejected too.. from another job! I found myself networking here on LinkedIn with the person who was hired at a different company I had applied to... and SAME STORY. I asked her what it was like, she told me, and I was like phew... I seriously dodged a bullet not ending up there! 😅 Thanks to these interactions I can honestly say I believe you will find the role that you are meant to have. So when you get rejected from something you thought was going to make your life better... realize you could be doing yourself a huge favor. It might just be helping you find what is truly meant for you. 🙌🏽 #uxdesigner #uxdesign #careertransition #careerchanger #jobhunt

Take 59. Preview - HOW DARE I think I am great! Who am I to admit with confidence and say I have a great understanding of Acting Work as an Acting Coach and that I know how much it benefits Actors, Directors, Writer and any other Prefessioanal out there. Who am I to convey that message and expect people to not roll their eyes at me! Who am I to be honest in my obsevations and give truthful feedback, after watching a Show on Stage or a Film, and not have people walk away from me or stop talking to me! Why do I continue to choose being alone, rejected and do not play to the general understanding of what and how I shoud behave and react to be liked and to belong? Because that will be of no help to anyone, with no room to improve, if we all play nice all the time. I have had it. I will continue to voice my opinions as I believe that the Art of Experiencing as ACTing is, needs that honesty and truth, which unfourtunatelly lacks in so many Performances and in Performers who think they are Actors. I will do it because I believe true ACTing is of Great Need to our Humanity in these Trying Times. Mihaela M.

It doesn't have to be Halloween to be scared...rejection is a scary thing all humans have to confront at some point (many on a regular basis).However, if you choose to look at the positive side of rejection, you can move past it more quickly and make great things happen!Here are a few ways to reframe rejection:* it lets you get a different perspective* it gives you a thicker skin, builds confidence and resilience* it helps you to focus on who actually needs what you offer instead of thinking everybody does (which they do not!)* it tells you how to shift something you're saying or doing to get to more "yesses" (i.e. get off of your script)Want to learn how to build your confidence? Reach out and let's chat!

It’s time I tell the truth…I remember the first interview I went on after I graduated from university. The managing director looked me in the eye and said, “You can’t speak to people, you won’t be successful in sales, give up on that idea”.  Weeks later, determined to prove him wrong, I pursued a job in direct marketing, i.e. door-to-door sales.   Do you know what pushed me everytime I felt like quitting? Everytime I got a slammed door in my face or was cursed at, everytime I got drenched from the pouring rain and barely able to knock because my hands were shaking from the freezing cold? I heard that person’s voice in the back of my head, “you can’t talk to people, you won’t be successful. Give up” THAT was enough to get me RUNNING to the next door because I KNEW every “no” would bring me closer to a “yes”.  Had I not got rejected at the very beginning of my career, I would not be where I am today, 8 years later, i’m no longer knocking on doors but working in my dream job as a senior account executive at Pareto USA the leading global sales and development organization. Now i'm learning from the greatest mentors and part of the most wonderful team, helping people reach their full potential every single day #job #career #rejection #interview #sales #perserverance #teamwork #potential #experience

Rejection is an important part of life. It's how we learn what we're capable of and where our boundaries are.Rejection is not a negative thing. It's a sign that you're trying new things, being brave, and taking risks.The more you get rejected, the more you can grow into who you want to be.#rejection #growth #motivation

Hello Rejection, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again... Here's the straight up on how rejection, criticism, and people telling you NO impact your brain. And here's what you can do about it. #rejection #mindset #resilienceatwork #neuroscience

Just now, I saw someone on my feed praising a company for sending her a response 7 days after applying, as they promised they would..Which was a template rejection e-mail.Am I living in an alternate reality, or are we now praising companies for doing the bare minimum when it comes to applications & feedback? I don't want to sound like the devil here, but half of the comments on that post agreed that the company is 'so great' for doing it. Someone from the company even thanked the person for the shout-out. And the poster was so impressed they hoped other companies would join in with this practice...as if basic decency is so ground-breaking and unheard of.Need I remind companies everywhere just how much time it takes to write a good resume, tailor it to a job if required, write a cover letter, build a portfolio, pass paid tests etc...and often times it ends in the SAME template rejection e-mail. All of that effort is already so unbalanced compared to a generic e-mail that literally takes 0 effort to send, even if a person or a machine does it.There is a viewpoint and a logic in it, I suspect - compared to companies that outright ghost people, sending a rejection e-mail IS something...But have we gotten to the point where we praise something so basic? I get that the market is rough but this is sad. We should demand more, hold companies accountable, fight to make recruitment a two way street, not pass medals for the bare minimum. #recruitment #rejection #jobseekers #jobsearch

Rejection is redirection. In many ways, it can be divine intervention.It can look like.. 👇🏼-A job loss -A break up or divorce-Someone else getting the promotion you wanted-Coworkers going to lunch or connecting outside of the office and excluding you-Everyone in a meeting ignoring you when you share your ideasDespite how painful it can be, rejection happens when the Universe see's you going left when you need to go right. It comes up when what you're doing isn't aligned with your purpose, your souls true desires & the things that will serve your highest good. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀It's life saying, "Hey you, you're a little off track. Let me point you in the right direction." And while it’s not always obvious in the beginning, rejection is often protection from the unforeseen. In other words: not getting what you want can be an incredible blessing. So if you're feeling rejected, find peace in the fact that you can’t miss what’s for you if you choose to show up & lead with your authentic self each day. Reframe rejection as redirection & see where it takes you.💡Can you reflect on a time when not getting what you thought you wanted and needed ended up being a gift in itself?#rejection #careerchange #leadershipcoaching #newchapter #mindsetshift #mentalhealthawareness #lifecoach #laidoff #divorce #companyculture #careerdevelopment

How do you handle saying NO to someone, whether the workplace or in social life? Well I think I have the answer...It's something we all struggle with but the extra workload or emotional baggage can be a burden and it's almost always at the detriment to ourselves.So I've compiled a list of the best ways to say NO to people that you can start using today!- "No"- "Sincere apologies, but I can't"- "Negative Cowboy"- "I AM THE SENATE"- *Point to yourself and with a wry grin say "Remember the Collapse?"- "I can't go to school today Mummy/Daddy my tummy hurts"- "Silence Peasant"- "I'm at the absolute end of my limit, at the edge of a cliff looking down into the abyss, your enquiry will be the final push, plunging me into unfathomable darkness"- "Yesterday I was the world's greatest benefactor, today I am the world's greatest Villan. Truth and falsehoods cannot be decerned by appearences. I don't care what people think of me, I have always remained myself"- "Shut up simp"- "LOOK, A SQUIRREL!"- "I SHAN'T"- "Blood of my Mother, strength of my Father, I cannot accomplish this task alone".- "I cannot, I am being sent heavensward for a greater purpose that you couldn't comprehend""REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"#Workplace #workplaceculture #workplacewellbeing #rejection

😤There’s nothing more frustrating than going through rounds of #interviews, only to get an automated #rejection email.🤔Has #automation become so relied upon that the personalization of an email or call is not a priority? Job seekers get many automated rejection emails. The least a company can do is be #personable, be #human to those that invest time to meet with you. 😔When a person loses their job they don’t just lose the opportunity for work. 💵They lose the financial means to meet their basic needs of living. 🏥They lose health coverage. Yes, there’s cobra - expensive cobra & with no income? Come on. 🧠They lose access or coverage with mental health services that they’ve made connections and progress with. They go through the struggles of will my “new” coverage cover MY therapist? Or how will I continue my #therapy  with no #insurance? Do you know how hard it is to find quality therapy with someone that you connect with? If you find a new therapist, do you know how hard it is to re-explain your situation and past experiences over and over just to get caught up to your current healing journey? #mentalhealth 📝These are just some of the things on the list of what a #layoff can do to someone. Not to mention the ups and downs of the moments of #anxiety and #depression that seep in from time to time. 👩‍👧‍👦To top off the cake, imagine being a #singleparent dealing with all this. 🙏🏼PEOPLE, be PEOPLE. You don’t know what someone is going through.❤️There is light that shines through when you see previous coworkers lifting you up through tags and posts and offering help on your search. Thank you to those that have done so for me. *I recognize this does not apply to all people who lose a job, but maybe someone can relate*

Someone told me it wasn’t a good idea to make a post about not getting a job on a platform (like this one) where it’s purpose is to get a job. I thought it could motivate does who also get rejections and let them know that you don’t always land your first job application and that’s ok. Since all you see in this platform is “I’m delighted to share I have accepted a…..”, which is totally ok, since it’s what it was made for; but, show how there is another side of the quarter. What do you think? #job #rejection #opentowork

I don’t know who else needs to hear this.. but if you got rejected by a job opportunity you thought you really wanted.. knowing you’re qualified and in some cases overqualified! IT’S OKAY. Not only do you deserve to be with a company that will value you and recognize your hard work, experience, etc. but it’s also probably happening for a good reason! REJECTION IS REDIRECTION.Except it, breathe and move on. You are enough! You are brilliant! #rejection #jobopportunities #ontothenextone

Not a job announcement… just an update😊The last two weekends I have spent time with friends at the State Fair🎟️ (food was amazing!) and saw Black Adam🍿in theaters. I’ve also received three rejection emails for jobs I applied for, and that’s okay. 📣Jobseekers and transitioning teachers, continue to be kind to yourself and take a break when needed as you continue to job search. I will be patient enough to find a place that will help me grow as an individual in the workplace, but will also allow me to have a work-life balance ⚖️#transitioningteachers #jobseekers #mentalhealthmatters #jobsearching #rejection #redirection

I've always been one to have a #plan. I have plans for my plans. When I decided to change careers my first thought was "what's my plan?" After drafting up a roadmap with several #coloredmarkers and #goals I hit the ground running. Well- spoiler alert but the plan I originally concocted evolved and changed and morphed into well... nothing resembling the original plan.As I #reflect back and think of the "almosts" and the "maybes" and the "if onlys" I am reminded that if all of the almosts and maybes had turned into something else then I would not be here- exactly where I am meant to be... To quote #taylorswifts new album: "everything you lose is a step you take" and often time those losses and subsequent steps lead you down a path that’s so much better than any plan…#careerchange #reflection #planning #jobhunt #rejection #rejectionisredirection #planschange

Me stopping for a BLT sandwich in San Francisco and realising that across the road, there is the dream #VC firm any #startupper in the world would like to meet.Is this a sign?Shall I cross the road, ring the bell and ask them if they are interested in making the world a better place? After all, I have been asking this question to every human being I have met in the past 12 years.No big deal.My #head says Naaaaaaaaaa. They will never take seriously someone just showing up like this.My #heart says, why not? Do you really still #fear #rejection after all these years? C'mon !Why do the fear of hearing the words "great but NO thank you" make you freeze in front of #opportunities? After all, we should get used to it if we want to #changetheworld.Instead every time taking the effort to dare feels like jumping from a #cliff. And when they say no it's like someone pulling the safety net from under you after you jumped.To all my #startup #scaleup friends, do you relate? Do you feel the same under that super confident this-is-the-next-unicorn face?#sanfrancisco #andressenhorowitz #vcfunding #siliconvalley #breathethefuture

❓❓If you get rejected from a position…Is there particular etiquette you should do?I’m cool with leaving it at that, but I also think sending a quick note to say “thank you for viewing my resume” is good.I also ask how I can grow to be considered for the next opening. #thankyou #resume #rejection #etiquette #growing

It doesn't always go the way you want.Rejection is a good thing.I hate rejection — just wanted to put that out there.Over the years I've learned a thing or two about it.It sucks.It actually can be protection.Others might call it redirection.When I moved to TX in 2017 I was solo without my wife and kids.I was looking for jobs all over the place.Interviewed with one place that seemed promising.I didn't end up getting the job.I was distraught, mad, and crying.No job meant family couldn't get to Waco.It had been 2 months of full on networking and job searching.Out of nowhere got a call from an acquaintance saying their company was hiring.Interviewed the next week and started a week after that.Remember that promising opportunity?They laid off the person who got the job and did away with the role 6 months later.In this story, rejection was good.Do you have a story where rejection was positive?#rejection #opportunities______________________Like what I post?Follow me & Ring the 🔔.Comment or DM me how I can help support you.

If you run a successful business, chances are you get huge amount of emails every single day. 📨Are all of them worth of your time? No. Declining this kind of offer should be made painless for both recipient and sender.With politely thanking a person, explaining our reasoning and perhaps suggesting some other ways of partnership, we can end a conversation in good terms without making someone feel bad for reaching out.Sale representatives are doing such an amazing job, connecting companies and making deals possible. If we cannot make it easier for them, we certainly shouldn't make it difficult or unpleasant. #bekindtooneanother ! 😊#sales #salesreps #rejection #business

Here are 5 stages of dealing with rejection.1. Change your Mindset toward rejection2. Feel the feelings3. Treat Yourself4. Refocus5. Accept the Rejection Come on, let's dive right in...🌸Change your Mindset toward Rejection: The trick to being okay with rejection is to learn to change your default mindset.A "fixed mindset" believes intelligence is static. There's no way to change what you're born with.A "growth mindset” views intelligence as something that can be developed and shaped with effort. They view challenges as an opportunity to learn and hone their skills. Those with a growth mindset know that it is impossible to become an "expert" unless they work hard and learn from rejections.Switch to a growth mindset if you often view rejection as an insult or damage to your ego.🌸 Feel the feelings: Don't try to brush off the hurt or pretend it's not painful. Rejections can leave you upset or frustrated, and you shouldn't suppress those feelings. They're valid.You can use those negative feelings to drive you forward because there is no better motivation than the desire to prove your critics wrong.🌸Treat yourself: As the old saying says, “if you don’t love yourself, who else will?" simple pleasures are what get us through our dailystruggles.A surefire way to boost your mood is to do things that make you happy. In turn, this improves your mental health.What you can do;🕊You can text or call a friend or relative who you know will be supportive. Don't be afraid to reach out!🕊Take a short walk outside. Natural green shades are soothing and mood-boosting.🕊Take out a notebook and pen and start journaling. Don't be afraid to express your hopes, fears, desires, and dreams. We grow and heal this way.🕊Enjoy a rich treat, such as a bar of your favorite chocolate or a sip of a warm beverage. 🕊Be nice to others. What makes this work? We feel warm inside when we perform random acts of kindness. Ultimately, everyone wins!🌸Refocus: focus on what you can control. Keep trying. You lose momentum when you quit. Don't rush; refocus your energy, and learn something new. Take small steps every day instead of making giant leaps. Don't let rejection stop you from working. Commitment pays off.🌸Accept the rejection: This journey is filled with rejection, and the sooner you realize that and accept it, the easier it will be.This is the only way you can grow and improve over time.Rejection is a harsh reality check. If you approach it right, it could nudge you in the direction that is the right fit for your talents, personality, and everything that makes you great.What did I miss?Do let me know in the comment below 🔽*************That's a wrap.If you enjoy this post:🦢Follow Olamide Oyafunke for more of these 🦢Repost to share this with your audience #rejection #contentwriter #personaldevelopment #try #opportunity #experience #people #socialemedia #career #writers #mentalhealth #kindness

Rejection - a challenging emotionEveryone goes through this in different phases of life. The rejection may be for one event or with an individual or a situation. Things don't work as we expect. We feel rejected. It is challenging emotion. Non-acceptance hurts.How to deal with it:1/ Accept the situation and before going to that pain, divert yourself with other options.2/ Give it a time. It does not get over quickly. But definitely, it goes away.3/ Learn from the situation or an individual that self-worth is more important than anything else.4/ Do not focus on rejection. Let it go. Do not hold on to it. Level up.5/ Keep reminding yourself the world has not ended. It has just begun to discover new things.Rejection teaches us to be stronger, smarter and determined.What's your take?#rejection #situation #challenge #writein #writeinclub

Rejection.In life, you'll get 100s of rejections.That does not mean the end of the road. Life will offer you more rejections and a few yes. Rejection does not define you but moulds you for something better. Most times you need 1 YES to forget the 100s of NO.Don't generate bad feelings against those who don't accept your terms, product or service.Preparing your mind for possible rejection doesn't make you a pessimist or faithless rather helps you to face it with a positive mental attitude.So never stop moving on till you meet the most needed and valuable 1 YES. #rejection #handlerejection

Neck and neck with hundreds and hundreds of applicants… This is the third time that I haven’t been rejected from a promising lead, rather, the entire position has been cancelled.

The worst things that can happen when you make a cold call……Michael Jackson tells you to beat it Kylie Minogue says get outta my way Stormzy tells you to shut up You get a NOA good percentage of the calls you make, you will get rejected.Which is why I changed my mindset.Stopped focusing on booking the meeting.We are making that call to add value to their business.If the prospect doesn’t want itThere is plenty of others out there that will see the value.That rejection is one step closer to that meeting.It’s a numbers game.Pick up the phone.Air Marketing#sales #salesdevelopment #sdr #coldcalling #prospecting #salesadvice #rejection

'They thought you were great, but . . .'Rejection feels like a slap in the face? That flat palm connecting with your cherubic cheeks and causing your head to wobble from side to side. Was it something you said? Was it that moment you interrupted because you thought there was enough gap in the silence? Or did you stupidly ask them if they had not seen And Just Like That when they mentioned that their husband was just on the Peloton?Nope, pointing out their loved one may have a heart attack is never a good look.Rejection - the same areas of our brain become activated when we experience rejection as when we experience physical pain. That’s why even small rejections hurt more than we think they should, because they elicit literal (albeit, emotional) pain.Cure? Remind yourself of what you have to offer. The best way to boost feelings of self-worth after a rejection is to affirm aspects of yourself you know are valuable.I'll start...I am an efficient problem solver 👊#virtualassistantservices #rejection #advice

Rejections can be a good theraphy….Why do I say so?The feeling of rejection is believed to have developed as an evolutionary tool to alert early humans who were at risk of being ostracized from the tribe they belonged to. A painful rejection from others in the tribe was likely to encourage an individual to modify any problematic behavior in order to avoid further rejection from the tribe. Those who were able to avoid further rejection were more likely to survive, while those who did not find rejection to be particularly painful may not have corrected the offending behavior, making them less likely to survive. In this way, humans may have evolved to experience rejection as painful. #experience #rejection #work #progress #change #leadership #job

What can you do to be #successful when searching for a #job, and limit the amount of rejection you must deal with? (A recruiters tip)No matter what your #dreamjob is, I have noticed a trend among job #applicants that will cause much frustration and disappointment. In the past few months, I have been recruiting senior #Python #developers for a 100% #remotejob. I have run and rerun this job over 20 times on LinkedIn alone. https://lnkd.in/gXez-2mYWith every ad, there are overwhelming amounts of applicants who very clearly did not bother to read the Job description. This is very sad for them because all they will get is #rejection. Here is my humble suggestion as a recruiter to everyone looking for a Job: Don't apply for a job if you have not read the job description and do not know if you have the skills and experience required for that job and if you are living in the target area.Here is why: All you are really doing is setting yourself up for frustration disappointment and failure. Employers and recruiters specify what they are looking for in the Job Description because that is what they are looking for. If someone in the recruiting process is just as lazy as you are, or you manage to get around the A.I. software some recruiters use, you may make an interview, but you won't get the job. It is not a lottery, mass entries do not improve your odds!So instead of using massive amounts of time and mental energy applying randomly to every job that vaguely matches your search, only to be frustrated by the amount of rejection you keep getting, take a breath, read the Job Description, and apply only for the right jobs for you. I guarantee your success rate will improve dramatically if you slow down a little and aim your applications more realistically at jobs you qualify for, have experience in, and are available to people in your geographic location.Employers want to hire the right employees, recruiters want to place the right candidates, and you want to get the right job. Work with the process not against it, and everyone gets what they want ;-)

Managing Rejection in Talent Acquisition: - While hiring for any position, I keep asking my team members, if they are maintaining a database of candidates rejected at different stages of selection process. Most of the time the answer is, ‘No’ Question they keep asking what is the importance of maintaining such database, when the candidate is rejected by the system? The importance of maintenance of this database is immensely important to the organization on following counts: - 1.    All candidates who are invited to take part in the selection possess similar skill, knowledge and competency. The only difference of being selected or rejected is either due to proximity or suitability to the role. In case of non-boarding of a candidate or early separation, this database becomes very handy to reduce turnaround time and optimizing lead & lag time cost, if the reasons for rejections are well captured and recorded. 2.    This database also becomes helpful for searching a candidate in future vacancy, particularly if the candidate is rejected on the ground of higher or lower competency and a vacancy crops up to match the competency. Again, thereby reducing search time, loss in opportunity cost and lead & lag time cost. 3.    Analysis of this database provides a significant input to market practices, salary benchmarking, hierarchy protocols and overall reason for attrition in the specific industry. Talent Management teams may revise their strategy of talent acquisition based on this analytic report. 4.    The analysis of such database may also help us in reducing the recruitment cost if used as a complementary component of succession planning by filling up the gap at lowest possible hierarchy, than looking for a candidate at the higher level.#hiring #TalentAcquisition #Rejection

How To Reply To A Job Rejection Email.Who doesn’t dread the rejection email that comes after having an interview? While it’s better to receive a notice rather than being ghosted, to know you weren’t chosen for a job opportunity can be disheartening.Nevertheless, it’s important to not allow your temporary anger or sadness at the moment affect your drive to find another opportunity that better fits you. So, before hitting the delete button, think about the possible benefits of sending back a quick response.Here’s an example you can tailor in response to a rejection email👇Dear Charles,Thank you for letting me know of your decision. And thank you also for taking the time to meet with me – it really was a pleasure to learn more about the role and the company.Of course it’s disappointing for me to see this opportunity pass. But following discussions with you and your colleagues, as well as my prior research, I remain convinced that XYZ is the company for me.As your team continues to grow to meet the challenges ahead, I would be grateful if you would give consideration to my profile when looking to fill future roles. I will also keep a regular eye on your website for new vacancies.Please don’t feel obliged (as I know you have a lot on your plate), but if you are able to share some brief thoughts on what I could do differently to secure a different outcome in my next application I would be most grateful.It’s been great to meet you and the team, and I’d love to stay in touch.Thanks again, and best wishes for you and your new hire.GiftGift@email.com+23472906436****************Did you get value?Do let me know in the comments below ⬇️.#humanresources #jobhiring #rejection #sogifted

Finding a job is the destination, but how is your journey faring, up until now?No matter what stage of life we all are currently in, we've been at the 'job hunt' phase and it's no cake walk. Often times, we assume that the world is ready for us, we have everything it takes, but one rejection just pushes us further down the tunnel.Most of us are afraid of getting rejected, and even if we aren't, we get the feeling that we aren't good enough. We know we want to work at our dream company, but we're seldom so passionate about it.I was once doing this research for a company I had minimal knowledge about. As I surfed through their website, I realised that it goes beyond a job description, we need something more to offer, a mere resume or cover letter is just the tip of the iceberg.I started viral content writing on LinkedIn. I don't know how I fare, but I do know that sooner or later, everything you do adds up to a whole, not today, not tomorrow, but someday. It's ok to have your heart broken at times, but when you learn how to fix it, there's nothing braver than that. Keep going, no feeling is final.#work #job #resume #linkedin #jobhunt #research #contentwriting #canada #toronto #networking #rejection #failure #success

POV: A jobseeker's expectations during her journey 1. A thank you or a general appreciation message after an #interview 2. A #rejection mail, it's better to have a clear answer then facing another ghosting process 3. Never being asked for money to proceed with an application. You never know what a person go through on a daily basis as a #jobseeker and on addition to that no one deserve this type of #behavior  4. Don't have to meet those type of people who later get the #permanent place in the list of "I'll never be this person in my career" #jobseekersupport #expectationsmanagement

Stop beating yourself up, when you get a NO! It is not a No for you, this No, could mean " it is not the right time.""It could mean I am not the right person to ask, " it could mean;"When you work on your numbers, you can get a yes soon"Take that in and share which one resonates the most with you. For me, " I just asked the wrong person"Keep asking, research shows that for every 9 "no s "you will get a"yes"........Believe me you are closer than you ever thought.

With how difficult it is to find work in South Africa, it is normal to experience job rejection at some point in your life. However, this does not make it easier. You could have the best CV, interview, and all the qualifications and experience they need. Yet that dreaded “We regret to inform you…” email will feel as if all that effort has been thrown away. It is tough to be rejected from work. It is okay to mourn the opportunity you worked hard for and question what went wrong or if you will ever find employment. Learning how to work through the rejection can help you feel better about putting yourself out there again.Let us look at some ways to cope with job rejection: You Are Not Alone. Many people are in the same position as you. Knowing that others have gone through this as you make rejection a less painful and lonely experience. Ask For Feedback. Ask the interviewer/recruiter what went wrong during the application screening process and interviews to give you closure and clarity on what happened. The information they provide you can help you make the necessary changes to your CV or improve how you answer interview questions. Should they explain that you do not have the right skills or qualifications for the job, this can help you adjust your job search. However, should they ghost you, this says more about the company than it does about you. It makes them look bad. “Rejection is merely a redirection” – Bryant McGill. You possibly avoided working in a toxic environment or in a job that could have hurt your career path. It is a positive outlook to have to help you build the confidence needed to apply for the next job that will be right for you. While it is easy to spiral into negative thoughts, the rejection may not have been about you. Try Again. You will eventually find the company that wants to employ you. The only way to know that is if you keep applying. Once you feel ready to, put yourself out there.#TheCouch #ThePsychologyCouch #Therapy #TherapyMatters #Jobs #Work #rejection

Is it a rejection or a redirection?I went for an interview about two weeks ago and it appeared that I was the only one who answered given questions correctly because it was a open kind of questions.Few days following the interview, information got to me that I got the highest mark and I was excited. I had applied for the same position several times at the same organization but I was never been called for an interview. It was my first time and I had prepared well! I exchanged contact with two of the applicants and there's this particular lady that I usually chat with.....It was she that made me know they already called some of them for documentation.As the news reached me, I was already hoping and believing that I would be called as well. To my surprise, I didn't get neither a call nor a message from them till this very moment.Why did they reject me?Why am I not selected?Did I not do well? Maybe I didn't bribe anyone to assist me or could it be because of my hijab? These are the troubling questions I have silently for them and it has been disturbing me.....I really wish to know what went wrong. 😔I was not being rejected, I consoled myself!🤗God is trying to redirect me.....I deserve a better place, better job offer and better opportunities.To all those whom might be in my shoe,To all of you who are putting your best in job search, I pray God give you the best job that you can't even imagine 🤲🙏I know Almighty Allah loves me and He will favour me.🤲#job #opportunities #motivation #encouragement #nevergiveup #keeppushing #redirection #rejection

A form rejection will also be used when the book is so far from ready to publish that enumerating the reasons would crush a person’s soul. The vast majority of any given submissions pile or email account is like this – just so bad it’s difficult to believe it’s not a prank. I’m not exaggerating for effect, either, this is from experience. Until you’ve experienced the awfulness of a slushpile, you’re not in a position to tell anyone there’s no such thing as bad writing.#rejection #writerwednesday #wednesdaywisdom #publishing #publishinglife #selfpublishing #bookpublishing #indiepublishing #publishingconsultant #independentpublishing #publishingtips #publishingservices #editor #bookeditor #editingservices #freelanceeditor #copyediting #mystery #romance #nonfiction #fiction #memoir #selfhelp #careers #biography https://lnkd.in/edm7Zz8m

Every interview is a lesson in itself whether you get selected or not.I think we learn more from interviews practically rather than watching videos on how to prepare for interviews. I have learnt a lot about my background industry in the past few days through interviews. And I strongly believe that this change was required to push me out of my comfort zone.Takeaway from last few days - Never take rejections negatively, these ups and downs are necessary to upskill ourselves and make us eventually better.

Why You Must Ask & How to Handle NoIf you want to increase the visibility of your small business, you need cooperation from other people. And to gain cooperation, you will have to ask people to do things.And when you ask people for things, sometimes you will get a ‘yes’ and sometimes you will get a ‘no.’How do you handle that? It’s actually possible to get a ‘no’ and not feel bummed out by it. In fact, you can even see it as a good thing. More on all of this in a minute. But first, here are some ideas of things you can ask others for.Keep reading here: https://lnkd.in/gEezTUiDo you ask for what you want in your business? #hearingno #rejection #business #marketing #asking #meaningpreneur

"As a young leader, all I wanted was my team’s “buy-in.”I was so eager to be in my first leadership role! All I wanted was for each member of my team to get on board with my vision. I put all of my energy into getting their approval. Whatever was in my power to do for them, I would do. I went as far above and beyond for them as I could – I bent over backward so that they would let me lead them.If someone on my team was unhappy, I saw it as a personal failure. I would get anxious and wonder, 𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘢𝘮 𝘐 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘥𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘐 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘣𝘦?Now let me be clear – asking what is in your power to do for someone else is not a bad mindset to have. But I was truly desperate… and not just for them to be better, but for them to like me – for them to buy into my vision. Or rather, I was desperate for them not to reject me.Back then, I did not know that there are different kinds of leaders, that I was a people-oriented leader, and how it impacted my leadership..." shares Florin Lungu.In this article, Florin shares how people-pleasing and fear of rejection hurt his leadership and 5 tips to avoid making the same costly mistakes.https://lnkd.in/eTwwyXtV#leadership #peoplepleasing #rejection #leadershipmindset

We have all been there, the dreaded rejection email or phone call. It is never a pleasant experience. But hey, no matter how successful a person is, there is always rejection in their journey. Getting rejected doesn’t always have to hurt, writes career coach Marlo Lyons, in Harvard Business Review. A-league actors get rejected for roles all the time, racing drivers get traded to other teams, politicians are voted out of office… the list goes on. “If you allow rejection to knock your confidence and make you doubt your abilities, it could negatively affect your performance in future interviews,” Lyons writes.Here are a few reasons to consider why you didn’t get the job: 👉 There was a “better” candidate.👉 You didn’t tie your skills and experience to the role.👉 You are a mismatch with the culture.👉 The job scope changed.👉 The job was paused or cancelled.Plus five ways to learn from it and position yourself for success in future interviews:💭 Understand that the perfect job isn’t always perfect.💭 Reflect on your values.💭 Sharpen your interviewing skills.💭 Incorporate feedback.💭 Develop resilience.How have you dealt with rejection after a great interview?

To lighten the mood 👀😂:Do you ever get a rejection email and kind of laugh a little bit? Silently say: “Well fine I didn’t want to work for you anyway?” Then thinking - how crazy they are for not realizing how incredible the talent is they just passed up on with their very generic rejection email? Yea, me neither. 😂😂You have these “Gate Keepers”, screening for jobs they’ve NEVER done. It’s oddly surreal. I think their job is difficult weeding out folks, choosing who to move forward and who to kick to the curb. One thing I’ll say to any hiring managers. Please have empathy. Especially when there are WAY too many folks on the unemployment line right now. We are struggling to live and feed ourselves. Some of us are on the verge of homelessness. Ghosting us and the generic “you’re not good enough, next” emails hurt and it IS personal. I’ve been a hiring manager and it isn’t fun to weed folks out. However, I am transparent and I have always stayed true to my word.While some positions are getting 100’s of applicants. I know not all of them are. But If the position received 1000 applications TELL US! That way it makes sense to why we are getting rejected yet again. Or if the job received 20 tell us why. I know that might not always be feasable. But man, It’s so discouraging opening your email every morning to 20+ rejection emails. It’s not fun, when you spend 15 hours the day before researching and applying for jobs. I just miss the days where I can show up with my resume. “Hear me out, this is why you WANT to hire me”. Those were the days. 😂😂To be honest this isn’t even me complaining. I really wanted to provide an outlook to hiring managers and recruiters that sometimes you need to put the shoe on the other foot. See it from our perspective. I’ll can truthfully say that I’ve been incredibly blessed these past few months. God has provided for me as I have been navigating through this season of my life. I KNOW that I will find the perfect role at the perfect time and I have absolutely ZERO doubt of that. I am incredibly talented and I always kick any roles keister that I take on. I have faith that God will continue to provide for me and my family (My Dog and Cat 💕). We will be ok, and if you’re on the job hunt SO will you. Be patient, just breathe and hustle your way through it! You’ve got this!!  #work #recruitingtips #jobhunt #rejection #unemployed #lifeandleadership #leadingwithahumbleheart #becurious #behumble #behuman #hiringtips #dontbediscouraged #encouragement #wednesdaymotivation

Okay, so I have applied at a few platforms, for writing, like Narrato The Urban Writers Cactus Communications. Applied for different roles in same sector but the reply was same that my application was rejected. So it is for everyone that it is alright for applications to be rejected, it's completely fine cause someone out there is working harder. The one thing I've learnt from this is that no matter how many time you face rejection you should never Stop. You are at least one step ahead of someone who didn't try.This experience taught me that a direct rejection is better that "we will get back" and moreover a few platforms even gave the feedback as why my profile was not considered, mainly because for not meeting the requirements and a few as i was not able to perform in the eligibility test and my score was lower than a few who got selected.so Never loose hope and keep trying.#trying #experience #writing #communications #hope #work #rejection

The more I look at the landscape, the more I'm feeling like my #education career is over. I'm still looking, mind you. But after four months of #interview, interview, interview, #rejection letter...or just the rejection letter, I can't keep getting high on the narcotic of hope. I'd like to think that even Charlie Brown would cock an eyebrow when Lucy VanPelt kneeled with the football after enough "WAUUUUUUUUGH!" moments & take up baseball or maybe knitting.So I'm thinking about pivots, #RTP & the #IT industry in particular. This article has given me a lot to think about.If I get a call about one of the education jobs I'm pursuing, I'll be elated. But I also have to stay grounded in reality. I've always said that the first company to extend an offer gets me. I believe in loyalty to the people who see your skills & value and choose you.A university offered me a job last month. I never saw the offer letter (I was using my UNCW email account at the time), & the "we'll get it to you" tone didn't suggest urgency...especially when the start date had to get pushed back by two weeks. So on a Wednesday afternoon, #HR calls & asks if I'd gotten the letter...about 30 minutes before ATT had a tech come to the house to troubleshoot our fiber connection. Those of you who'd had video meetings with me since we moved to the house in August 2020 saw my connections drop--sometimes for hours. He had us down all afternoon. Everything from the curb to the living room was replaced. The next morning, I remembered the letter. I couldn't find it in the #Outlook account I was using. The organization had the #security at max. The offer letter got quarantined, like really quarantined to the point where I had to to a special page to review it & tell Outlook multiple times that it was safe before I could even SEE the content....and by the time I turned it around, the offer had been rescinded. "You were stalling!" Because my would be boss had been sending me texts & calls on my mobile, I sent her a near-sobbing video message, trying to explain. No response.Folks, I want to get back to work. I've been idle for four months. "Surface Pressure" (from Encanto) has been one of the rally songs I put on a motivational playlist when I lost my job. "Under the surface,I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service." If I get an offer on one of the higher ed or instructional design jobs, I'll probably do a Snoopy style dance on the spot...pain & physical disability be damned.But I also can't chase higher ed waterfalls while the last of my unemployment ticks away, and I have to now seriously consider liquidating what little retirement I have to stay alive.I'm not stalling. I'm not playing games with people.I want to work. I want to be part of a team, something larger than myself.If that's not in education, it's time to pivot to IT.

//REJECTION// 4 Tips on Handling Rejection as an EntrepreneurFor this month’s weekly discussion series, I’ve been tackling 4 ways to handle rejection as an entrepreneur. Being on the receiving end of rejection causes a cascade of uncomfortable emotions, but if you reframe the experience, it’s actually a pathway to success.This week is all about accepting while all things must come to an end, sometimes they end without any closure. The proverbial door gets slammed in our face and because we don’t like how things ended, it sends us down the rabbit hole trying to understand why, stopping us from being able to move forward. My advice? Sometimes you just have to suck it up buttercup and move forward. While this wasn’t your rodeo, it’s not your last rodeo either. Flex that faith muscle and believe that something else is around the corner. The old adage that when one door closes, another one opens, has always been my experience. Trust in the fact that much more is meant for you. It’s this kind of shake-up where you are forced to pick yourself up and pivot that leads you down a different path. One you wouldn’t have taken otherwise. Let faith in your abilities help you close those open chapters. Missed last week’s post? Here’s why it’s important to know your value. https://lnkd.in/ghB9MRAr#entrepreneur #business #value #skills #rejection #discussionseries #ThoughtfulTuesday

For today’s soapbox piece I want to talk about ✨TOXIC POSITIVITY✨ and normalizing negative experiences/emotions. One of the problems with toxic positivity is that when it happens the person usually means well! It’s human nature to gravitate towards rooting for the underdog and to avoid discomfort. I am guilty of even doing this to myself! It’s ok to grieve, be frustrated, cry and scream. Furthermore, there is no timeline for grief. Some days your loss/situation will hit you harder and randomly. This is something that can be felt with rejections, layoffs and demotions. Not everything happens for a reason or is a story about powering through a difficult time to come out on top. There is power in accepting change as it comes and an outcome that is not guaranteed to be positive. Change is scary. Failure is scary. You and your support network do not have to put a positive twist on everything. Sometimes when you transition you might be taking a step or two back and it might be a while until you get back to baseline. Part of taking care of yourself is allowing yourself to feel something other than positivity and happiness. I personally have been there and am still there sometimes. Today 10/27/2022 marks one year since the discontinuation of a journey I prepared my whole life for. To be frank, it sucked to start anew, and it was scary. It still is scary. I enjoy my job, but I struggled to go to the office today because it hit me like a wave. If you are out there and you are transitioning to something new, it can be discouraging and it might be tempting to say “this too shall pass” or “it will all work out in the end.” You might have to start from somewhere lower than square 1 to get your foot in the door. My advice is to be mindful, open, and present in the moment. Do not compare your situation to someone else, your past, or your expectations. If you find yourself struggling or frustrated with your situation, I am here to lend an ear as you process your emotions. It’s ok to be sad. It’s ok to believe something sucks because it did not work out. It’s tempting to keep things positive to avoid discomfort, but do not do it. I know that was long, but thank you for coming to my soapbox. I appreciate you and hope you are doing ok with your journey ❤️#change #soapbox #transition #careerchange #squareone #personaldeveloment #story #worklifebalance #layoffs #recruiting #hope #interview #life #positivity #empathy #connection #happiness #work #failure #healing #mentalhealth #rejection #reflection #power #transferableskills #newbeginnings #networking #vulnerability #balance #understanding #careers #vetmed #staffing #resilience #love #support #motivation #recovery #struggle #linkedin #network #worth

It's almost the end of the year and it's been truly amazing.Let's talk about #rejections!I started this year with full force. I had applied for 2 Erasmus Mundus Programme scholarships and while I was rejected for one masters programme, I got an admission offer for another without the scholarship offer so I had to decline. Of course, I applied for other scholarships but these two stood out the most.I had already used most of my savings to move to #abuja after my #nysc program in Kano so I had to transition from being a student to being a graduate and it was not easy. After the rejections, I was distraught because all of my plans was in disarray and I had to make new ones. I kept asking myself "what's next?" My next step was to gain financial stability. I decided to take #freelancing seriously so I built my Upwork profile and it was the breakthrough I needed but my social life was taking a hit due to being indoors all day. However, by taking this initial step, other doors opened up for me and I got the opportunity to work for The Foresight Group — Innovation | Technology | Entrepreneurship as the Executive Assistant to the CEO. Because of this, I was able to learn about the #techindustry and interact with tech leaders in Nigeria. Now, I get to be part of a corporation and a #freelancer at home. In Miley Cyrus' famous words, "I've got the best of both worlds".Ultimately, the message I am trying to pass is; don't stop. Sometimes, we get rejected and unfortunately, that is never going to end. When you start making big moves, keep the pace going so that your fire won't burn out. Somehow, it will all fall in place.Good Morning !#nigeria #innovation #work #work #leaders #entrepreneurship #growth #technology #opportunity #motivationalpost #rejection #erasmusmundus #erasmusplus #tech #scholarships2022 #scholarshipprogram

Rejection Can SUCK…If You Let It.Every time we get rejected it hurts a bit.That’s human.Actually, rejection is nothing more than redirection.The key is to stop, take a breath, and ask:What is that rejection offering me?A chance to improve a chance to let go of something that was holding me back, a chance to better understand what my counterpart really wants, a chance to move on?All of the above?Rejection is actually a valuable lesson to bring us forward, if we choose to see it sa such.A lot of people choose to dwell on the hurt, the „bad guys who just don’t get it“, or any number of negative feelings.Don’t be that person. Be better than that, and see it for what it really is:An invitation to redirect and keep going…Be Your Absolute Best.

Hey guys, so it happened again, but this time I don't know how to feel. On one hand, I am proud of myself that I received accolades from a company worth over $3 million and on the other hand I am surprised I was turned down for this role even though I knew from the get go, I didn't even meet 30% of the requirements. I am very much open and available to take up product design, UI/UX design and user research roles. I sure will appreciate your recommendations, referral and considerations. I am skilled, I have the mental endowment to think out of the box and a countenance of humility to allow team work strive. If you would like to see what the assessment was about and how I went about it, kindly reach out, I would be more than happy to share. #productdesign #ui #research #share #teamwork #freelancing #like #teamwork #opentooppurtunities #assessments #rejection #rejections #rejected

4 Amazing strategies to reframe rejection.There's nothing more heartbreaking than dedicating all your energy, time, resources to getting something done, and it is not getting accepted.A lot of people lose their self-esteem when they are rejected. Many people feel they are not good enough, so they abandon all their goals.This is where reframing rejection is effective.The term "reframing" refers to looking atsomething from a different perspective.Often, when we try to view an issue from a different perspective, we can overcome the fear or discomfort it causes. We take back our power and turn this challenge into an opportunity. Instead of accepting circumstances, we engage our curiosity and ask 'why.'Here are some tips on reframing rejectionso you can take back your power:🌸Reflect on past rejections: It's worthwhile to remember times in your life when you've been rejected. How did you get over those rejections and release them? How did you move past them?Write down the methods you used to get over those old rejections.Consider how you might reframe this rejection using this list.Try one of them.Maybe you had always had a hard time with rejection and cannot recall a time when you were able to let go. You are not alone! Why don't you try out the next tip or the next one🌸Explore Your Curiosity: How did this rejection expand your experience? Do you find any minor errors in your submission that need to be corrected?🌸Maybe all you need is a cuddle with your Cat/Dog, a hot bath, and a piece of chocolate.Self-pampering can make you feel moreenergetic and help ease a sad heart. I love this!🌸Think creatively: Why not focus on the people who like your work instead of dwelling on those who don't?Refocus your attention from the harshness of rejection to the warmth of your lovers.Ps: There is no doubt that you have the skills, beauty, talent, and ability to do the job.Even if others do not believe in you, believe in yourself.Post inspired by Titilope Adedokun.

#Please #understand as the called & sent ones of God; the enemy will use #anyone that’s #secretly #jealous of you while in your face  #rooting for you to make you start feeling #unworthy. This is easy for the enemy not just because of their jealousy but because of you needing #validation. #Getthatwound checked please. #Rejection #uncharted is a #purpose killer. #catchit especially from a spouse, a relative, a close friend, to name a few. Signed, Rev Shelia Kovette CookP. S. Trust God to do the shift, he got away of doing so we don’t walk around with “What if????” Jesus understood the #assignment.

Do You Feel Lonely?Points to Ponder#The hard and bumpy journey to success at times is lonely#On the contrary we have a crowd once success is achieved#Wise folks wouldn't hesitate to take help when required#Failure is always lonelier and we are pushed to a corner#It is quite common to see many deserting us when we flounder#It is surprising to know that the loneliest feeling is about realizing our potential but failing to make progress#It is a good idea to remain lonely than be influenced by toxic people#At times we just need a break, be alone and make a trivial shift in our perspectives#A torrid season of loneliness and isolation is the metamorphosis that creates a lovely, magical, awesome butterfly!#loneliness #failures #rejection #lifelessonslearned #careerbuilding #mindsetmatters #help #people #success Source: Credit to the original creator

"If you can’t handle rejection you limit your possibilities for success." - Dave Trott Repeat the above statement to yourself until it becomes second nature.You most likely heard it said different ways by a lot of people, successful people, or growing up as a child — If you don't ask, you don't get.For Apple fans, Steve Jobs also said the same, picking up the phone and calling.Fest is a reality, bravery isn't always a quality found in all of us, but boldness is when we choose to go against fear. Rejection doesn't stop us, it s a hurdle.A book about life, a book about work. A book about confidence.Predatory Thinking - #hashtag #nuffsaid#aşk #ifyoudontaskyoudontget #rejection #hurdles #life #business #pickupthephone #askforwhatyouwant #askforhelp #askquestions #goodquestion #answers #motivate #create #inspire #motivate #staymotivated #wednesdaymotivation #wednesdaywisdom #PJC #PjClayton #phillipjclayton #nothenamepjc

As a healthcare provider, you’ve taken an oath to take care of your patients to the best of your ability. But as the owner of a practice, you also need to take care of the financial side of your business as well. As part of your revenue cycle management, it’s always challenging to maintain both patients and your billing activities, having an in-house biller is always expensive and you need to make sure that your staff is always updated to the changes that is applied by the payer and your practice management system. By outsourcing your billing activities you can always spend more time with the patients, which results in an increase in the count of the patients which again results in to more revenue generation.

Advice I would tell my younger self, don't worry so much about what people may think of you (especially if they don't know you personally), or dwell too much on mistakes, but acknowledge and learn from them.Not everyone will like you and that is okay. People will judge you, but not know your story.I used to think success was monetary job title and status symbol, now older I look at success differently. Instead I  think of how and what #steps #progress are you #improving and what #impact do you have on others? Are you being your #authentic self? I have #failed a lot, I’ve made several #mistakes. I’ve been #rejected more times than I can count. I’ve had people doubt me and my abilities or point out my #weaknesses and  #flaws and #imperfections. I’ve had #selfdoubt  and #impostersyndrome.Remember everyone fails at something even Michael Jordan famously said “I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” Michael Jordan #Qoutes #resiliency #Mistakes #Rejection #Failure #Success #BeYourSelf #bedifferent #BeWeird #authenticity #unique #lifeexperiences

“What hurts the most, love ❤️ or hate 👿?” - he asked.“Rejection” - she whispered. - Insia Fatima.Often people say “love hurts”, but truly love ❤️ never hurts!  It is the lack of love or the feeling of betrayal or rejection.  We have all experienced rejection on some level.  As the kid who was chosen last for the PE team, the girl who didn’t get asked to the dance 💃🏼, or the job you wanted but weren’t given the offer!  It comes in many forms but we often ignore that rejection could mean protection.  Maybe God hid your value from them because they were not assigned to your destiny!  He has bigger and better plans for you and you just can’t dream, quite that big!  The next season of your life, as God puts you back together right in front of those who broke you, they will likely wish they had treated you better!  You know they say, you don’t know what you have until you don’t have it.  So the greatest thing you could do for yourself, if you feel rejected, is to dream bigger!  Realize that God saved you from settling for less than he knows you deserve.  As you go forward, focus on your future, don’t put your value in someone else’s control, know it for yourself!  Don’t let rejection drag you under, rise above and remember, WHOSE you are! #thrive.1 PETER 2:4“As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious.”.These @dolcevita booties western style are so fun and perfect to style up for a good concert!

#workplacewellbeing and the dilemma of #defimation It is an edgy topic. #defimation can start from two directions either an #assistant who wants your job or a #boss who wants to cut the #salary. Unfortunately, the third reason for #defimation is #personal either #jealousy or #romantic #rejection. The best way to survive #defimation is to keep the focus on your work. When the attack comes from the boss and the follower it means you are fully #betrayed and you must find your next adventure. #unfortunately there are people out there who do not want to commit to contracts and there are assistants who are willing to do it even if there is no raise a title promotion can be all that they want or maybe they just do not like you or does not want to have someone who knows more around. Maybe both dislike and want exclusivity. #Unethical, #toxic workplaces are full of these practices. Solving this depends on many factors. Ask a #career #consultant because the action you should take will depend on your #background and #industry. #work #job #like #people #workethics
