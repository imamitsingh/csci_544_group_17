Ladies & Gentelmen.This is Web 5.0 for you Vision of #web5 return "ownership of data and your #identity ".1.web 1.0 (  B2B Businees to business communication )2. web 2.0 (C2C consumer to consumer comnunication bloggers, orkut etc)3. web 3.0 ( M2M ,machine to machine communication semantic web using AI ,machine learning  ).4. web 5.0 ( control and own your #IDENTITY )your job is your own  data and your profile is  your own identity .twitter is a great example on how employees being open about #layoff and employers  being open about company debt.twitter employees and employers are not allowing HR  or 3rd party to Manipulate and steal their #identity .In pre #covid19 era ,Middlemen (#HR #humanresources #recruitment team ) used to hijack your resume(profile) and sell them as commodities and make commission/profit out of it.the most easiest way to earn money in last 20 years was to be in #recruting  businessthe effort of getting new business/projects  is of the employer,the effort or attaining competencies  is of employee but there is no effort or liabilty on #HR Humanresources recruting team during layoffs, but there is guaranteed commission.that's why HR keeps posting of non existing job vacancies so that they get their commision even though the HR knows for a fact that the company is in debt and possible layoff in next few months.if HR later on claims they didnt knew about company debt.well its their god damm business to know the status of employment for atleast next 5 years because one of HR standard question is."where do u see yourself 5 years from now " web 1.0 in late 1990s ,email ,intranet came with the promise that middlemen , job agencies would vanish  and using electronic mails(e-mails) employers can directly communicate with prospective employees without any middlemen.but what actually happened is that HR recruiting industry grew leaps and bounds and   top Indian IT companies (#wipro, #infosys, #capgemini etc )became bodyshopping houses and instead of building software products they are only #reskilling employees so that they can be sold  as comodities .

Last week was the end of a great but too short adventure at Stripe. #stripe #layoff Super grateful I had the chance to work alongside world-class product folks. I learned a ton and will miss my team.I'm looking for new product design opportunities (full-time or part-time) and would be psyched for any intros üôè

Ken Sandberg was my manager at Salesforce and a joy to work with. I am happy to connect any #stripes impacted by the #layoff.

üí°Was lehrt uns der #layoff von Stripe: Gesundes Wachstum vor √úbersch√§tzung!Viele Unternehmen nutzten w√§hrend der Pandemie die Gunst der Stunde: Tech L√∂sungen boomten (Fintech, eCommerce, eLearning usw.). Die Unternehmen setzten auf schnelles Wachstum. Aus Start-ups wurden rapide wachsende Unternehmen. Viele machten mit ‚Äûwe‚Äòre hiring!‚Äú auf sich aufmerksam und lockten so zahlreiche Talente an. Und nun, entlassen sie hunderte bis Tausende von diesen Talenten wieder. Nach nur weniger Zeit im Unternehmen ü•∫. Was diesen Unternehmen vermutlich gefehlt hat ist eine krisenfeste, langfristige Planung. Was w√§re wenn- Pl√§ne. Oder auch die Erfahrung so manche Krise √ºberstanden zu haben. Stabilit√§t und Krisensicherheit sind Benefits, die nicht so fancy klingen, die aber viel f√ºr die Mitarbeitenden bieten. Denn stabil hei√üt nicht unbeweglich. Viele gr√∂√üeren Unternehmen befinden sich in der Transformation. Manche kleine Unternehmen setzen nicht auf ‚Äûhigh-pace‚Äú und mega Wachstum, sondern ‚Äûhaushalten‚Äú mit dem, was sie erreichen, mit Vernunft. Geben ihren Besch√§ftigen Freir√§ume und die Zeit zur Entwicklung. Vernunft, das w√ºrde ich mir heutzutage im Business mehr w√ºnschen.

Twitter went through a massive layoff, with over 50% colleagues let go last week. My heart goes deeply to those impacted, especially peers on visa and thus need to find a next job as soon as possible. The tech job market is currently more challenging than ever as we approach the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023 with grim economic outlook. However, there are still opportunities and please don't lose hope! My fellow Tweeps, if you find any connections in my network that may be helpful, please feel free to reach out to me for an introduction!#layoff #tweeps #lovemyteam

I personally don't like laying off of¬†Twitter TwitterI think new management should convey their goal to existing employees with the time period. If they cannot complete it then they might think about it. Please say your view in the comment. See Others' view result after your vote.#twitter¬†#layoff¬†#fair¬†#potential¬†#like

We are living in an extraordinary time. My heart goes to all of our friends at Twitter, Stripe, Convoy, and all other companies who went through layoffs recently or waiting for a layoff! I know how terrifying this period can be and how it worsens if you are on H1/L1!  Please feel free to contact me if you need any support to get your next job. I can help engineers and product managers with referrals, resume reviews, and interview preparation. I can contact my connection to refer folks with non-technical roles.  #layoffs #layoff #twitterlayoffs #support

I've been shocked by what I heard and saw during the past week. I can't believe many of my friends get laid off, and I understand it's urgent for all of you that have been impacted by the layoff to get new opportunities. If you are a senior software engineer(SDE) with solid knowledge in programming (Python, C++, JavaScript, C#), have been exposed to relational databases (PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, etc), and are also interested in working on the fields to enhance either the digital or the physical security of Bloomberg, our teams could be a good fit for you!

Layoffs are a good time to sell hope to people for getting a job and along with it selling their product.Take advantage of the situation, play with emotions and sell the product. Here I would suggest to folks, üö© don't lose confidence and believe in yourself, if you cracked a job before, you can do it again.üö© If you want to upskill yourself or want guidance, there is a lot of content available for free, are there are a lot of people offering help for free.üö© Analyse your situation and see what works best for you, don't get influenced. #layoff #job #support
-----------------------------
The #layoff may have been inevitable. The way of layoff was a DELIBERATE choice. No matter, who you are, never demean human dignity. Every single individual deserves dignity & respect from the employer. What Elon did was wrong at so many levels because he set a terrible precedence that so many other CEOs/ Promoters will follow  in years to come & most CHROs will oblige them.#twitter #layoffs #dignity #choice #twitterlayoffs

I've been getting a lot of questions about the recent layoff announcements from Stripe and Twitter...And of course, I have many thoughts...I'll share more soon, but in the meantime, take a look at the email twitter sent employees on Thursday. Overall, I noticed a lack of ownership - and a lack of care. Two things Stripe managed to communicate in their layoff announcement.What did you notice?#layoff #communication #leadership #wordsmatter

Opened my LinkedIn feed and it is just filled with layoff posts. It's unfortunate to see such kind of situation currently. BYJU'S , Twitter everyone is laying off All folks who lost their jobs don‚Äôt worry about it it‚Äôs a temporary phase . You just lost your job from one company , lots are hiring . Stay motivated , prepare well , hustle hard for interviews and apply to other jobs and I am sure you will definitely get plentyIf I can help anyways for a referral at Amazon let me know #layoff #jobfinder #twitterlayoffs #faang #google #amazon

Well, naturally in my downtime I decided to launch a new brand.Blue Collar Betty is all about embracing the culture of blue collar workers, playing the support role which is often overlooked, and it's just plain fun.When my partner first referred to me as Ol' Lady I cringed so hard my eyes almost got stuck. It took me a long time to understand that it truly was (in their eyes) a term of endearment. So here I am, embracing it all, ol'lady included.You can find me at https://lnkd.in/gCyECH6uI'm using this #layoff to pour into my passion projects and build some rather #passiveincome streams while I also try to get back into the 9 to 5 world. Passion projects don't make anyone LESS of an employee- everyone needs a #creative outlet.

Reading about these layoffs has my heart broken üíî  Being impacted by one earlier this year, I can sympathize. For a lot of people in tech, a part of their passion and identity is the work they do for their company [and yes, many of us are guilty of working more than 40hr a week!]. For those who have trouble removing themselves, their identity from work these reminders are for you:-You are not your job- your job is an aspect of who you are but your worth is much much more -It's okay to not feel okay- as silly as it may sound we sometimes live in a world of toxic positivity. While you may not feel amazing today or even tomorrow- I can promise you will not feel this way forever-You deserve to take care of yourself! Self care comes in many shapes and forms; Mental, Emotional, Spiritual, Social, Physical, Practical, etc. Focus on what YOU need at this point in time. Some people will be quick to jump into the practical side and find their next role while others may take a bit more time to do some soul finding and take a break. Whichever type you choose, there is no wrong answer.-It's okay to ask for help- the easier said then done phrase that personally keeps me awake at night. If you are reaching out to family, friends, mentors, LI connections, or just the LI community- we are here for you!  If you see any roles at DoorDash that could be interesting to you or just interesting in networking, please message me. I would love to help in finding your next adventure#layoffs #layoff #stripe #lyft #opendoor #netflix #zillow #compass #wearehiring #doordash #community

Many companies such as Twitter,¬†Stripe, Lyft or Convoy had layoffs in the past few weeks. During economic uncertainty, how can a company avoid layoffs? After doing some research[1,2,7], here are 7 alternative options I have found:‚úèÔ∏è‚úèÔ∏è‚úèÔ∏èWhich one do you think is the best alternative?‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è Reassign employees to any other job: Lincoln moved some factory workers into sales during recession when order fall short.‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è Help employees start new business: In 2011 during restructuring, Nokia provided Individual employees or teams an opportunity to win grants of up to ‚Ç¨25,000 to start their new business.‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è Offer training grants: At the same year, Nokia also offered training grants for business-management and trade-school courses. As a result of the program, 60% of the 18,000 affected workers knew their next step the day their jobs ended.‚úîÔ∏è. Furlough: Honeywell furloughed employees for one to five weeks, providing unpaid or partially compensated leaves during the recession. This saved them the equivalent of 20000 job estimated by their finance department.‚úîÔ∏è. Stringent performance evaluations: Lincoln Electric had a no-layoff policy in its U.S. operations since 1958. It maintains a very strict performance standards and a rigorous evaluation process. Performance is competitive within departments, and performance ratings are tied to a merit-based compensation system. Employees who fall in the bottom 10% receive an improvement plan and, if they remain there consistently, are eventually let go.[4]‚úîÔ∏è  Work share program.[6]‚úîÔ∏è Cut benefits and perks.  What other things' company can do to avoid layoffs?[1]https://lnkd.in/grc89Rid[2]https://lnkd.in/g7Kr_wDa[4]https://lnkd.in/gw7QzGmK.[5]https://lnkd.in/gm_pQbYD[6]https://lnkd.in/gBqZrSuN[7]https://lnkd.in/gnR5hPTA#lyft¬†#stripe¬†#chime #twitter #convoy #layoff #tech

I would have ran multiple ‚ÄúProductivity‚Äù scenarios donning the hat of an FBP across organisations and proposed FTE or Resource optimisation plans to my business counterparts but today when I see a few of my friends actualising those productivity numbers of the organisations they belong to, it somewhere feels heavy!I do realise, cost optimisation is a part of business but perhaps we as humans could do so much better with how we look at it beyond numbers & simulations, in reality -1. Layoff is a #phase and not a change. Understand this. Do not be judgemental.2. #navigate the state of denial with the one who has been impacted without vague affirmations.3. #engage with them in the new normal & contextualise what they‚Äôre going through.4. Give the other person all the time & #privacy before going with an array of suggestions and connections. Wait till they are ready & need any #support.5.#listen & only listen to all that they want to vent out to get over it.#layoff #empathymatters

Clever move #byjusThe idea is that since Messi's brand image will be seen by actual customers (parents and children), such news about layoffs or workplace conditions won't actually have an impact on them from the perspective of the customer. However, the level of employee trust does decline.#casestudy #brand #byju #messi #fifaworldcup #smartmove #edtech #employeebenefits #businessanalyst #businessmodel #layout #layoffs #layoff #thoughts #shareit #repost

Hello - I am looking for a new role and would appreciate your support. Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, or opportunities you can offer.  #layoff #jobseeker #opentowork #layoffs #design #designer #jobfinder

There was always a question in my mind that if ever I was asked to not come to work from the next day then what would I do?And one day this became true and I was asked to leave the company and I said "Sure, Great". No hesitation at all.After a couple of days I was asked whether I would like to continue? I said "No".That's a moment of self respect. Money may come and go but it's important to overcome this fear.I hope that people laid off lately will take it positively and make a story out of it to remember.Always remember whatever you're paid in a job is nothing but just a token. Money is everywhere around us and we just need to learn how to get it and job is not the only way to get it. #work #selfrespect #layoff #money

Unfortunately, the #twitter chapter of my career has come to a close and I join the thousands of other Tweeps who have suddenly and unceremoniously found themselves derailed from their careers, professional passions, and daily lives.To the ex-Tweeps who are on this journey, as well as others who have found themselves in similar circumstances at other companies: please remember that there will be a time after this and though we may not look back on the experience fondly, we will be able to take that much more pride in our subsequent achievements. As current and future leaders ourselves, we should also take a moment to learn from this experience and commit to doing better for future generations of workers.To companies that are still recruiting: don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to strengthen your own teams. A ton of highly talented individuals with a wealth of knowledge, experience, diversity, and fresh ideas just became free agents. I can personally vouch for the folks I‚Äôve had the honor to lead and learn from: Kathy Pink, Xavier Mascaros - MsC, CSM, PO, PM, Cynthia Thomas, Vanessa Szajnberg, Jer√© Summers-Hall, MSHROD, Wei-Sean Chan, Lucy Moore, Tobe Okeke. If any hiring manager is interested, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me with questions or for a referral. As for me, I am also looking for my next opportunity! My experience spans ad tech, sales operations & systems, product / program management, product operations, and analytics, both as an IC and a people-leader. Please see my LinkedIn roles for more details on specific achievements and scope of impact. If you‚Äôre a recruiter or hiring manager and you like what you see, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to chat!#opentowork #twittertakeover #layoff

FInally the blue bird #twitter has started singing but this time the song is not sweeter for many.We have seen the growth of twitter over a decade, making it one of the bigger and fastest growing companies and for many people in the IT it was a dream job to get into twitter.But, in last couple of months what happened at twitter and as the #elonmusk became the so-called chief twit of twitter, he took some of the toughest decisions in very short period of time. There are lot of take-overs happened globally some healthy and some hostile but the twitter was one of the unique and most talked of all in recent times. The bird which is famous for its 160 letters is making life of many so tough, people don't have any idea what hit them.It was inevitable, the #layoffs as it is known to the world that the way Elon musk operates his companies is very different when compared other big names of industry.There is a lesson to be learned in all of this, companies with the best working conditions, working culture, corporate handling with best of the perks could go to the hostile and unbearable working conditions. So, never get too comfortable, be open and ready for the unexpected to happen.Musk's warning to twitter employees to work unorthodox hours and days to keep their #jobs and able to pay their bills was on of the worst thing which came out of it, the employees who remain at twitter after #layoff will be feared for their jobs not knowing when will their time will be up.The layoffs could have happened in a better way, Musk could have addressed the employees and made his intention of firing people clear to them instead of revoking their access to their login after the days work or people waking up in the morning to know that they no longer working at twitter.Always, find the better way of doing the harsh and tough things with consideration and humility#work #job #people #growth #culture #corporate #aetos #aetostech

How are you treating people? If you are a black woman, how many times has this happened to you... I believe some layoffs are cloaked and it is really bias, discrimination, anti-black actions, etc.  It is not just ppl in high profile roles, it's those of us open  to work to...#layoff #culture #bias #discrimination #CourageousConversations #Ethics
-----------------------------
#bloombergnews #twitterjobs #elonmusktwitter #layoff Is that true?Twitter is now asking some fired employees to return as they were laid off mistakenly. How can an established and popular company make such a mistake? Or was it just a trial to see if they could survive even without them?It is more like childish behavior without knowing how much damage it can do to someone's personal and professional life.Well! Elon justified his action by saying he had no choice except to lay off employees as Twitter was losing over $4M/day. He said exited employees were offered three months of severance which means they are well off, but money is not everything.I hope every exited employee finds a well-deserved position!

Any time I face adversity, I naturally and immediately ask myself, ‚ÄúWhat can I learn in this situation?‚Äù For the past nearly-two weeks, I‚Äôve been thinking, studying, analyzing, and meditating on what my layoff is teaching me, and I put pen to paper tonight, literally, and rapid-fired out hundreds of words on the amazing lessons I‚Äôve already learned. My first thought was shock and heartbreak upon receiving the news, but my brain flipped almost instantly to ‚Äúhow can I help others through this?‚Äù The reality is, I will be fine and will land gently, but I am also here to #help - it‚Äôs my calling.

Being laid off in 2020 was one of the BEST things to ever happen to me. It may not feel like it in the moment but sometimes what feels like a curse can truly be a BLESSING.

Advocating for Free speech and sacking employees with such treatment.It seems to be a forced deal on him [Elon Musk]. So revenge like events started happening.He will face lawsuits, No doubt. Elons attitude is even is being questioned by his fans.$44 billiion giant handling it , operating it with profitability won't be easy.Having some empathy towards workforce won't cost you a dime.It will be case study for unicorns who are not profitable and still burning cash on marketing and acquiring consumers.All the best..

During a #mass #layoff in well-funded #startup, people have to shrug off hypocrisy. It just add up to the stress levels. People have to understand that there is lot of relaxment of labor laws as compared to 1-2 decades ago and it adds to the #EaseOfDoingBusiness. People (employees) choose well-funded startups over others to leapfrog growth in their career and actually it‚Äôs a win-win game. However, the pitfall is you never know what will be next move of the board and their next level of ambition. Then this game becomes a risky game especially for the non-founding team employees. At this moment, I don‚Äôt have a solution for such people who have been shown pinkslip but only advice which I can give them - don‚Äôt increase your financial liabilities too much which you cannot afford being jobless for next 6-12 months and next time, choose your employer wisely.#liability #ManageLiabilities #FocusOnSavings

While coming out, a lot of emotional feelings, anger & resolutions üò•üò§Why this happened to me üò∞After working so hard why the hell they did do this to me?At least would have given time so that I could have moved somewhere else!Will never work for anyone...Wish to build a large company and buy the same company that fired me...This made me push to build multiple ventures later, employed hundreds of people, got multiple awards from Deloitte for building Fast 50 India & Fast 500 APAC Company, sold one of the ventures to a $65Mn company, and now again on a journey to build the next generation social audio venture from India for the World.Sometimes when I look back, i see every experience counts, every moment good or bad taught me a lesson and gave me enough courage to do something new.¬†That is my Entrepreneurship journey so far. With the current lay-offs going in the market I am sure we will see new Byju Raveendran, and Elon Musk in India very soon !! üòä¬†If you are laid off recently, a better future awaits for you. So don't worry at all!!¬†#entrepreneurship #layoff #byjus #elonmusk #india #people #career #twitter #ceo #halloclub #inspiration #culture #startup

#laidoff by BYJU'SHi Everyone, As you are all aware, Byjus is #terminating 4000 of its #employees , and I must say with great sadness that I am one of them. I was shocked after getting this news from my colleague. I was broken for few moments then I remembered my dad's  words " Beta you are a brave and strong girl " , soon you will get a good job.But here i am not gonna discuss about BYJU'S work culture, behavior with employees and all. I am looking for a good #oppurtunity  and will join on an immediate basis.I am having 2.6 yrs of expertise in auditing, operation, operational risk , risk analysis , quality analysis.Also i am a very quick learner and received multiple spot awards and recognitions for my performance.Please let me know any good opportunity and help me out in my difficult time.Thank you in advance and wishing you a happy Diwali.#jobfinder #layoff #helpajobseeker #jobseeker #openforwork #oppurtunity #hardtimes #audit #mnc

Hi everyone! I just learned that a friend was layed off today. They have 20+ years of experience in disaster recovery, crisis management, business continuity, people management; they are one of the BEST people I‚Äôve ever worked with and any team would be lucky to add them to their roster.If you have open roles, please message me and I‚Äôll connect the two of you. Thanks in advance! #job #layoff #crisis #crisisresponse #crisismanagement #dr #disaster #disasterrecovery #businesscontinuity #bcdr #em #emjobs

So how many of You agree that "Dr. Evil" Elon Musk is totally a Grinch for laying off a gazillion employees right before the Holidays?(Yes, I know that "the business of Business is business" and that such cuts may seem cold since what is more "important" from a business standpoint is the "bottom line" - I learned that in the Ethics course I took for my Master's in Business Communication - but I still think it is an absolutely rotten thing to do and the timing is terrible - not that Mr. Elon Grinch cares at all (again, see my comment above about the bottom line.))#twitter #elonmusk #elon #musk #evil #layoffs #layoff #business #communication

ü§îI have so many thoughts about why the human factor was missing during the mass layoff via mailü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but I will not do that. Instead, I want to focus on what we can do for those who have lost their jobs. #twitter #layoff #culture #leadership #ManagementüòîBeing fired is never an easy experience. It can be hard to deal with the emotions that come with it, and it can be challenging to move on. As a (self-)leader or manager, it's important to support someone who's just been fired. You can do several things to make the process easier for them.¬†üíúHere are seven tips to help support someone who's just been fired.ü¶ú1. Talk to them about what happenedIt's important to talk to the person who was fired about what happened. This will help them to understand the situation and why they were let go. It will also allow them to ask any questions they may have.üí°2. Help them to understand their optionsThere are usually several options available to someone who's just been fired. It's essential to explain those options to them so they can make an informed decision about what to do next.üîí3. Be respectful of their privacyIt's important to respect the person's privacy during this time. Avoid gossiping about their firing or sharing too much information with other people. Instead, let them tell their story in their own time and in their own way.¬†üõó4. Give them a positive referenceA positive reference can go a long way in helping someone who's just been fired find another job quickly. So, if you're able, provide a positive reference on LinkedIn for the person who was fired.üß∞5. Connect them with other resourcesMany resources are often available to someone who's just been fired (e.g., unemployment benefits, career counseling, etc.). Connecting them with these resources can help them get back on their feet and find another job more quickly.üåà6. Help them see the silver liningHelp them see the silver lining by pointing out the positives in the situation. For example, this could be an opportunity for them to pursue their dream job or take some time off to relax and recharge.¬†üì≤7. Keep in touch with them¬†Once the dust has settled, make sure to keep in touch with the person who was fired. Check in with them periodically to see how they're doing and whether they need any help. Getting fired is a hard experience, but with the right support, it can also be an opportunity for growth.¬†With these seven tips, you'll be able to support someone who's just been fired through this difficult time.

Hundreds of thousands of employees have been laid off this year.¬†It happened to me six years ago.Between the shock, confusion, shame, and fear, managing all of those emotions was incredibly hard.If you‚Äôve been impacted, I know you‚Äôre going to need to start looking for a job soon...¬†But before you start, please create some space to muddle through those challenging emotions.Have empathy for yourself. Be kind and don‚Äôt let yourself take the blame for what happened. It‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs a million different things that were out of your control.I know it‚Äôs hard to reflect right now.

Today I called the maid of my previous home as I wanted her to work at my new home. My other friends have been staying here for a long. Here is the conversation snippet of the aunty and me.Me: Hi Aunty, Namaste. I have been shifted to a new house along with my colleagues and want you to work here as well.Aunty: okay Bhai. But rates are increased in the market. So I need to charge accordingly. Are you okay with that?Me: okay aunty, no issue.üòÑAunty: okay, I Will come. (after a pause) But ...but...wait..as you said your friends were staying there, do they already have any maid working there?Me: Yes, they have. Bus she hasn't come after Diwali. And they also don't like her work.Aunty: "Okay. Pan bhai, em kem marathi bichara koini roji roti chhinvi shakay!!"(But...but..how can I take away someone's bread-butter!ü•π)I was able to feel that deep-rooted kindness and humanity in her voice. I was in shock, like what, what just she said!!!!‚ú®After a thought, This small story made me realize the below things.There is no relation between your financial, social, intellectual, or success condition with the amount of kindness, humanity, and sanskara you can carry.ü´∞Where on the side we have those billionaires and so-called "revolutionary human intellectuals of the century" who are taking so-called "very needed aggressive decisions for the future success of the company" (even that too without any prior notice and unexplained business impact), the other side we have these real gems of the society where even if they are struggling to make their ends meet, they are conscious and empathetic about the other human beings as well.ü™∑Kindness and humanity is the most important aspects and need of the hour.‚è±Ô∏èI am not criticizing all the decisions of every organization. I don't even have that position to do so. Along with that, I also understand that sometimes it's the most needful for the business to do so. But even in those times, what is needed is to have those basic human qualities and values in the decision maker so that even those toughest of the decisions could be carried out while keeping empathy and kindness also into consideration so that one can have a more mature and humanitarian decision that can lead to holistic balance and development of the society, human beings along with business success/ retention.And... it's also not impossible to do so as we have many examples of such revolutionaries like Ratan Tata sir, Narayan Murthy sir, etc. who are super great industrialists as well as awesome human beings. They have proved that you can do that! Those are the kind of people we need!üíïKuchh palle pada kya, Musk bhai?üòÖ#MuskPleseBeMastInsaanFirst #work #success #corporate #twitter #society #kindess #empathy #humanity #twitterlayoff #layoff #businessdecisions

PLEASE READ THIS! Posting anonymously because a lot of people in my connections also do this. I wholeheartedly and genuinely appreciate those who are giving referrals or connecting to the right people to help those who got laid off. Also, I see a lot of people who are using this as an opportunity to get more followers/connections/fame/publicity whatever. It's simple, make a post about ongoing layoffs and ask to reach out/comment for referral and when the person does they are simply ignored with no response. Please stop this cheap like/comment/connect on the post or DM me for referral trick!  If you cannot help, don't post it's simple. You have no idea how serious this is considering the current situation and the mental stress and VISA complications one would be going through. You're not helping here and making it difficult for people from reaching out to the right person. If you want publicity/fame/connections this is not the platform and this is not the right time to do it. I understand you would be flooded with DMs and I'm not asking you to help each and every one I know is not feasible. But do help atleast 50-75% of the people in need if you are posting.And to people who are reaching out for referrals or laid-off recently if someone is not responding after posting feel free to comment below their post that will help to identity the fake people/spammers. The more the number of comments, the chances are very high that the person is not genuine. Also, you can post in blind for referrals, you get instant replies and easy to get referrals.One trick I used while doing the job search in the US is to use LinkedIn search to the maximum. For example, if you want to know who is currently hiring on amazon, search "amazon hiring" in the search bar and go to the people tab. It will list the current amazon employees who are hiring.Again, hats off to people who are genuinely providing help/referrals to people in need.P.S: I'm not working at Amazon or I'm not impacted by the recent layoffs. Posting this so that people change their mentality and not take advantage of the current situation.#twitter #amazon #layoff #stripe #lyft #faang #referral #jobsearch #msinusa #cheap #publicity #recession #linkedinnews #kindness #goodwill #immigration #people #opportunity #hiring #help #connections #change #kindness #internationalstudents #elonmusk
