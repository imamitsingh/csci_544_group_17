Hey, My Dear LinkedIn . . . People are getting fired. People are earning 7 Lakhs/Month. People are joining FAANG.People are posting screenshots for eve-teasing. People are missing their Ex. People are not getting any hooks.People are cursing Elon Musk. Startup’s are shutting down.Didi/Bhaiya are getting sponsorship from Scaler, Hirect etc for paid promotion. Didi/Bhaiya are giving some random gyan with a selfie attached at last. I think LinkedIn is only the saddest platform without the #sad 😢 reaction.  #dukhdardpeeda #randomdevatnight

Is it just me or is anyone else really disturbed by this?I keep seeing announcements from various organisations about the creation of warm banks and whilst I would always celebrate the generosity and compassion of these organisations, I can’t help being really disturbed that in 2022, this is something we are actually having to do - create spaces for people to be able to keep warm and fed. My head finds it hard to compute that I’m living in a country where this is now a reality.  #keepwarm #community #sad #21stcentury

Binance is pulling out of their deal with FTX.It's important to note that an LOI doesn't mean that it's likely that a deal will be done.What is happening now with FTX is tragic, but I hope everyone will recover from it.From the upside, regulators are going to be coming in with mandatory shared proof of reserves. This situation could push people towards on-chain activity in the trading space. But it's too early to tell, so let's see what happens.Let's keep building—the light through all the clouds is still there!#crypto #web3 #sad #times

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): More Than the Winter Blues As the days get shorter and there is less daylight, you may start to feel sad. While many people experience the “winter blues,” some people may have a type of depression called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). https://lnkd.in/gJYm-KhJ#SAD #SeasonalAffectiveDisorder #depression

There are times in life when we're faced with unforeseen circumstances. And this is one of those times. They say for a new journey to start, an old one has to end. I am sad that my journey with Prodigy Education is coming to an end. But at the same time, I am proud to have worked at this remarkable organization. The people and culture here have taught me to be a better version of myself and I will forever be grateful to Prodigy for that. This was sudden and to be honest, I'm still in denial about this happening in reality. And yet, I can't help but appreciate how ethically and empathetically Prodigy brought this news to us. Yet another reason that makes this journey all the more memorable and hard to accept that it's actually coming to an end.#people #culture #help #education #grateful #layoffs #layoff #sad #forever #bonds #job #india #bengaluru

I feel sick to my stomach! 🥺Meta, Twitter, Netflix and a gang of other companies have been recently laying off folks in massacre fashion. Although #layoffs are needed to help businesses survive, I am still lost for words of the tens of thousands of folks that are now looking for work during the holidays. It’s heartbreaking! 💔What I am hopeful for is just how helpful we all are as professionals. I am seeing posts of people offering introductions, free resources, and more! Simply people helping people. 🙏With that being said, if there is ANYTHING that I can do to help please reach out! If you need any introductions, do not hesitate to ask. #work #metalayoffs #twitterlayoffs #sad #netflix #meta #twitter

"I've found that there is always some beauty left - in Nature, sunshine, freedom, in yourself; these can all help you."(Anne Frank) I can't quite believe that only last week I had to finish the photo shoot the attached photograph of Bernice Mia comes from slightly after 9 am as the sun was getting too intense. Of course, I had more photography sessions over my 8-days stay in Santorini, including the one at 1 pm, but the purpose of that one was different from what I normally do - on that occasion, I needed to shoot in full sun to achieve what we intended. Anyway, it looks like - at least in Wales - these are the days when we may need to create a bit of our own sunshine...When I was 17, I read my first book by Albert Camus. It was The Plague and I was so fascinated by it that Camus became my favourite author for years to come. And it is his words that I remember when literal - as well as metaphorical - light is limited, when it's harder to stay cheery. I want to share them with you because it isn't often that words are simultaneously utterly flawless as well as helpful in mental reframing...Here they are then: “In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back.”Wishing you a happy bright Thursday,Ela➡️ Let me help you take your business to the next level: find my email in the comments and contact me to arrange a free 30-minute phone call to discuss your personal branding photography needs➡️ Click on and follow my LinkedIn hashtag👉 #elafraczkowskaphotography 👈 for my tips on running a small business and everything #businessphotography.#authenticity #cardiffbusiness  #bristolbusiness  #diversity #inclusion #londonbusiness  #montecito #SAD #santorini #imeanbusiness

Our Co-Founder Lyanne Hodson has been featured in HELLO! Magazines wellness section giving her top tips SAD (seasonal affective disorder) with Lydia Mormen!#PR #wellnessPR #fitness #SAD
-----------------------------
Back in 2013 I experienced SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) for the first time. It was like being hit by a bus. I'd left the UK in 2001 and had forgotten how tough autumn/winter can be here. I'd returned from Singapore in May just in time for the British Summer.It was this time of year (the last Gardener's World episode had just been broadcast, it's my annual reminder to watch out). I had to cancel a work trip to India, I was barely in a fit state to make it as far as my kitchen so forget about making a long haul flight.This was before I'd retrained as a Health Coach but I was already aware of how much I could do for myself vs the GP's solution of a prescription. Today I know what I'm up against, I start to plan for it in Spring.I make sure that I get Vitamin D (from the sun) as soon as it's available in late March/early April.I supplement with Vitamin D when it's no longer naturally available. Through genetic testing I know that my Vitamin D receptors aren't working as efficiently as they could so the supplementation helps to manage this.I get outside first thing in the morning to support my circadian rhythm... which is where the sunrise comes in. Getting enough quality sleep is also key.Finally I make sure that I'm outside for at least an hour in daylight. It might be a walk, gardening or working outside. This is critical at this time of year.All of these things help - there's a relationship between Vitamin D and serotonin which is why focusing on this has really helped. So far it hasn't raised it's ugly head again.#seasonalaffectivedisorder #SAD #mentalhealth #healthcoach

Spring forward, fall back 🕰I really don’t mind when the clocks go forward an hour to adjust to summer and daylight savings, but when the clocks go backwards in the autumn I am a complete mess 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴SAD. Seasonal Affective Disorder. It’s a thing. The older I get, the worse it seems to be, and I guess it doesn’t really help that I have chosen to live in Sweden at 59° N.The darkness is really setting in now, and for the last week I’ve felt really tired, and [let’s be real here 🙃] a little depressed at the fact it’s going to get darker and darker still for the next six weeks until the solstice. I’ve been sluggish, have not focused as well as I normally do, and I definitely haven’t had my usual levels of will power to cross off everything on my to-dos.Now more than ever I really appreciate that we work async at Remote, meaning that I can truly shift my working day around to capitalise on the few hours of sunlight we get up here to work with my energy in the most basic of ways, and that it’s not an issue.I’m now officially on “winter mode” which for me means switching on my SAD lamp every morning, eating a later breakfast and lunch, moving my dog’s walks around to daylight hours and blocking my diary so nobody can book over this sacred time, catching up on call recordings from under a blanket, and lighting a candle by my desk for extra cosiness, scandi style. But the best thing about async and working remote is that if I really need a power nap and my calendar allows for it, I will take that lovely delicious nap and give myself the boost I need. Being able to listen to my body, and not having an ounce of guilt over it is very much an evolved version of Fiona, and I love it.So, it got me thinking… Surely I am not alone in my behaviours, even though nobody ever talks about it 🤭#fionaspolls #soitgotmethinking #lifeworkbalance #async #asynchronouswork #myschedulemylife #efficiency #energy #powernap #wellbeing #work #mode #winteriscoming #sad

INFLACIJA POSUSTAJE, EURO POVRATIO SNAGUAmerički indeks potrošačkih cijena u listopadu objavljen jučer pokazao je ono što se već nazire neko vrijeme: da inflacija posustaje.Cijene su porasle 7,7 % u odnosu na prošlu godinu, odnosno 0,4 % u odnosu na prethodni mjesec: oboje ispod očekivanja.Temeljna inflacija, bez efekta promjena cijena hrane i energije, porasla je 6,3 % u odnosu na prošlu godinu i 0,3 % od rujna, također ispod očekivanja.To je stvorilo očekivanje da će FED na idućem prosinačkom sastanku usporiti s podizanjima kamatnih stopa, kao i da ih neće podizati iznad 5 posto.Ovo je inače najbrža kampanja podizanja kamatnjaka koju je FED pokrenuo, i to u borbi protiv inflacije.Nakon ovih vijesti, S&P500 indeks je imao najveći dnevni rast (5,5 %) od koronaške 2020. godine.Tehnološke dionice, novo crno zlato i pogonsko gorivo američke i globalne ekonomije, rasle su još spektakularnije, 7,4 % (NASDAQ).Ako se prisjetimo srijede i potopa kripta, koji su se jučer oporavili na krilima očekivanja FED-ovog zaokreta, normalno je da je i euro povratio snagu preko pariteta. Prinosi na obveznice isto su znatno pali.Sljedeći tjedan pisat ću o tome kako će sve to utjecati na indekse i raspoloženje investitora na kraju godine.#inflacija #SAD #NASDAQ #sp500 #eurusd #euro #paritet #FED #investiranje #kamate #zaduživanje #krediti #financije #kriptovalute #kripto #rentacfo

Reminiscing. I had a short article ready to post this morning. But I woke up in a different state this morning: thinking of the past. I was thinking of times with my children and grandchildren. So many good memories - my son, still in his pajamas riding on his tricycle bringing a cat home - can we keep him mom? My baby daughter, not crawling but traveling across the floor, back down, on head and feet on the floor moving like a crab. Tobogganing off the top of our geodesic dome with the eldest granddaughter and playing computer games and laughing with a younger granddaughter till she peed her pants. These are memories that can't be replaced or totally appreciated by anyone else. But these are the memories I/we want to reflect on when the day isn't going as we want. These, and many more good times, are important to cherish and pull out when life is handing you gloomWhat precious memories do you have? Are you bringing these out and sharing them when you or someone needs an uplift? These are the good times we need to share and spread when the world is in turmoil, when we are down in the dumps and feel defeated. Don't dwell on difficulties and sadness, recognize them for what they are, and then as soon as possible, move to some of the happier times with a smile on your face and in your heart.#goodtimes #happy #sad #children #grandchildren #life #memories

Niestety, rzeczywistość nie zawsze jest taka kolorowa. Jeżeli w pierwszym odruchu pomyśleliście o angielskim określeniu na smutek, praktycznie trafiliście w dziesiątkę. Tym skrótem jest bowiem określana choroba afektywna sezonowa (SAD, ang. Seasonal Affective Disorder), znana również jako depresja sezonowa.

#Meta is laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees Wednesday.Meta provided lukewarm guidance in late October for its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings that spooked investors and caused its shares to sink nearly 20%.he company’s costs and expenses jumped 19% year over year in the third quarter to $22.1 billion.Meta is laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a letter to employees Wednesday.“Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history,” Zuckerberg said in the letter. “I’ve decided to reduce the size of our #team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.”Meta is heavily investing in the #metaverse, which generally refers to a yet-to-be developed digital world that can be accessed by virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. This hefty bet has cost Meta $9.4 billion so far in 2022, and the company anticipates that losses “will grow significantly year-over-year.”#Zuckerberg said during a call with analysts as part of its third-quarter earnings report that Meta plans to “focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas” during the next year.#cnbc #challengingenvironment #hiringimmediately #sad #metaverse

今天是11月11日。雖然大家現在想到的大多都是上購物網站清空購物車物品，不過應該也有人知道這天是來自於中國的光棍節。光棍節從原本以自己仍為單身一族為傲的慶祝活動，轉變成讓曖昧男女在這一天暗示自己單身、可以脫離光棍狀態而舉辦交友聚會的「脫光節」，到後來電商平臺將該日宣傳為「雙十一狂歡購物節」，至今已經跟單身沒有太大關聯。https://ift.tt/NytuiKX但說到單身，倒是有個日子跟單身有關，那就是單身者留意日(Singles Awareness Day，簡稱SAD)。這天並不是在11月11日，而是在西洋情人節的前後。有人把它放在情人節當天，讓沒有伴侶的人不用參加傳統的情人節慶祝活動。有人把它放在放在情人節後一天，也就是2/15。那單身者留意日可以做什麼呢？你可以想想你周圍單身者為組織、社群與學校的奉獻。或著單身者也可以一起辦個活動，彼此問候「Happy SAD!」。好啦，看起來應該是自嘲的節日吧。----1111這天，有跟上購物活動？買到要墮手的可以按個讚喔。#1111 #Single #SADSINGLES AWARENESS DAY - February 15https://ift.tt/562TQJESource: https://ift.tt/OgQo7d0

« Advertising is based on one thing…happiness » -Don DraperI think #marketing and #advertising has lost its touch. It’s become toxic. It’s too focused on hitting #sales numbers. I want to turn back time and go back to the golden age of the #business and understand the real meanings of the #industry itself. A lot of #agencies are talking about the importance of #socially native #strategy and #user-generated content by digital creators to give the perception of #authenticity (whatever that means to #consumers and #brands today). My questions to that are…Is not all content meant to be #social and generated by #creators of content (the users creating and consuming)? Are any pieces of content #inauthentic if created with good #strategy and #intention at heart?If we want #liberation of #marketing and a #revolution to make things better for the #world, the industry and our good #company, let’s remember the state of the union (or world at large) is constantly fighting a war. People crave content that is authentic - they also crave a #reality that is different and maybe even better than what they know to be real and possible. I am a #storyteller and #storytelling is at the heart of #art and #commerce. You can’t sell without a #story and without a story there is nothing to sell. I appreciate both, though seemingly they are in opposition. My challenge (or maybe question) is - can smart marketers and ad people remember how to tell stories to close the deal? I want to see more #dreams, #fantasies and #complexity to forget what is #sad, #plain and #simple - usually the best and authentic and timeless stories have both!To close, yesterday was my last day at Bazaarvoice. What a chapter finished. I came back to a company I left - and left rising the ranks and changing my life forever leaving it all behind for something new and true to me. 😊 A few thank you’s are necessary, because every story has a full cast and crew -Alex Kirk for being my first boss and fearless leaderLaura Staples for teaching me when to fight for what you believe in and when to listenZarina L Stanford for mentoring me both personally and professionallyAmy Skudlarczyk for reminding me to always kickass with kindnessAlex Roselli Jenny Goldsmith Charlotte Mark Rebecca Smith Eric Schieck Jeff Bradley for trusting me with a lot of high stakes deals and presentationsDouglas C. Straton Douglas Foulkes for reminding me work is serious but can still be funMeaghan Danielson for reminding me that your job is just a job, not your family or your entire lifeJonathan Hauser Ryan Testerman Yang Guo Malcom Buckelew for being my emotional support system through life changing eventsTom Addis for teaching me that sometimes you have to show some tough love and be bold to get across the finish lineI’ve run out of characters so not everyone gets the S/O they deserve. What’s next for me? I can’t say for sure, but in the meantime I will keep on #dreaming and staying #happy for myself.

Some are running in search of work for food, while others are running to digest food by overeating.At midnight, someone's Pajero car stops in the prostitute village, the wife waiting at home is sighing!Someone is dreaming of continued happiness with his wife from a broken home!Some people think that after signing the divorce papers for a few days, they will be released!! Someone is fighting to maintain a relationship.Someone wants to be free of responsibility by throwing the child in the dustbin. Someone cries for a child all his life!No one can sit at the dining table of lakhs of rupees and eat rice with satisfaction!Someone is swallowing rice with onion and green chilies.Sleeping in someone's expensive bed and having to take sleeping pills! Someone is sleeping in the cold air, on the road, on the over bridge.No one wants to read the new books on the reading table.Someone is plowing the old bookstore, pocket is empty!Someone sitting in a luxury car is worried, the children are not human! Can you keep so much property?Someone is walking on the road, thinking to himself that he was able to raise a child! God willing, they will build the life now.Really colorful people, colorful dream kites...!But the last address is three and a half hands of land.Reality 🙂#reality #sad #happiness

Aaron Carter passed away at the age of 34 on Saturday 💔 I grew up when he just started his career with Nick Carter. I remember my sister and I were singing and dancing, listening to his songs: "I Want Candy" and "Aaron's Party" a lot. He was also on Disney Television Studios's Lizzie McGuire as a guest. He was battling an addiction and mental issues, and he said on the news he was sober for five years. I do not know the reasons for his death but this is a devastating news for everyone, especially for his family and friends. My condolences for his love ones. You will always be remembered by your love ones including all your fans. I hope his soul rests in peace😢❤️The New York Times article explains about this sad news 👉https://lnkd.in/gHuDT8JK#aaroncarter #nickcarter #thenewyorktimes #sad #breakingnews

Animation Special Mention:With the recent passing of voice actor Kevin Conroy, I had been reminded of a somber moment from animation that helped me to truly grasp the concept of mortality and death when I was a child. Just as I wrote in the past about the episode Pigeon Man from "Hey Arnold", there are moments in animation that are not sorely about silly moments that make us laugh but to teach real life lessons that stay with us throughout our lives. In this instance the moment in question involves a moment from another classic Nickelodeon series "The Wild Thornberrys" in the episode Forget Me Not and an aging elephant named Rebecca. Forewarning: Keep a box of tissues at the ready. #animation #cartoon #television #sad #nickelodeon #thewildthornberrys #lifelessons #elephants

"Around mid-October, I can feel my mood start to shift. I get bummed out for no reason at all. I get irritable. I can't sleep for more than a few hours at a time and I'm more tired than usual. I just feel blah. People who suffer from mood disorders are more likely to develop Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Unfortunately for me, I have been living with depression for half of my life, so getting SAD is almost a guarantee. #sad #seasonalaffectivedisorder #depression #mentalhealth #mentalhealthsupport

This is a post about naming emotions and describing how they make us feel. Are they the same or are they different?We use language to name emotions. They are abstract nouns or nominalisations. Here's a bunch that we may be most familiar with:Happiness, anger, anxiety, sadness, guilt, shame, worthlessness, love, hate, jealousy, unfairness, humiliation, boredom or disappointment.  Of course there are many more....When I ask a client how they feel I may get the reply - sad, happy, angry, anxious etc which are adjectives. We have learned to use these words. They are familiar to us.As a Psychotherapist I need to unpack each and every one of the emotions clients bring to therapy. What does it mean? How do you feel when you are angry?This is where the real work starts. I might say, "When you are angry, where do you feel that in your body?"  I might invite my clients to close their eyes, beginning with focusing on their breath then I help them become relaxed and engaged.My client may say, "I feel hot."  "Where do you feel hot?" They might offer, "In my head" or "the feeling rises from my stomach, then my whole body feels hot."  Now I know that my client feels hot when they are angry I can support them with techniques to help them feel cooler when they are triggered by anger. A scale can be used - 1 being cool, 7 being very hot - how is your temperature right now. We can use a dial to turn down the thermostat.Anxiety can make a client's breath quicken. Their heart might pump faster or they might feel sick and even want to pee. These are bodily sensations - feelings.When I discover what the emotions are and how they make my client feel we can work on the why's and wherefores. When don't you feel like this?  When did you remember feeling like this before? What would your life be like if you didn't feel like this?These bodily sensations are primitive reactions to real or perceived danger and they activate our survival mechanisms of flight, fight, freeze and collapse.  Our reactions may have worked the first time we felt in danger but often we continue to react to any small thing that is similar to the original event that made us x,y or z leading to continued anger, sadness, anxiety etc in the future.Can you name an emotion that you are feeling now or quite recently and then sit and see how this emotion makes you feel in your body?Emotions are somewhat binary words whereas feelings get deep down and when we work with feelings we often can see real improvement in our mental health.Finding a Counsellor or Psychotherapist who understands how to work with emotions 'and' feelings can be a positive step to feeling calmer and happier.For the therapy models I work with it's the emotions and feelings first and then the thoughts that come with them. #emotions #feelings #thoughts #happy #sad #depression #anxiety #failure #fear #love #hate #contentment #shame #guilt #mentalhealth #counselling #psychotherapy #trauma #cptsd #ptsd

This is a great source for me to share my experience,  Eddy How do you show up for your people? #people  means  only a #think, and they #feel according to it, either it is #happy or #sad to #feel #happy,  behind it, there positive think or thoughts hidden positive thoughts means  #only  to be there, where they present physical and seeing & enjoying with it's surrounding It means nothing present in their mind to think about their personal life to #feel #sad  means their think stuck in their present life's matter, and it becomes a problem for them, and to feel sad in their lives think stuck means to think negative with the help of self experience + knowledge It means they are only physically moving here and there, but mentally present, at their problem place It means a word #peace #escape from their hearts show up  means  by observing their life, according to my knowledge, they are getting same prove, hand to hand more than show up, my focus is how they change their negative think into a positive think to feel real stable peace + enjoy in their heart negative think means at present the stable programming of their mind is to think stuck negative, and to feel stable sad in their hearts #change  needs to add an additional decided programming of mind to think stable positive for long duration, on daily bases to feel real stable peace in their hearts, during this period long duration + daily bases means the time duration and intensity level to feel sad decreasing, and time duration to feel peace is increasing to become stable I observed, if I am thinking and doing some good for people, then my knowledge about life is increasing, automatically as a reward or reaction of my kind action it means we get much more from other sources that we gave or left for others inaccessible to your people means you live in their hearts with love & respect as a reaction people become inaccessible to you means people are doing 99% needs of your life it means there is a need for you to think and do some good for your people first before you to get much more than you thought and known as real unique knowledge about life it means if I think only my personal benefit first, then my good luck or success level are very finite

Thermoelectric materials are a class of materials that convert heat into electricity. Thermoelectric generators are already being used by NASA for different exploration missions. However, lead and tellurium based thermoelectric materials provide the highest conversion efficiency, they are extremely toxic to the environment. While thermoelectric effect refers to the direct voltage generation from temperature differences across the electric junction formed by two dissimilar conductors (thermocouple), researchers have reported a new copper based biphasic material that intrinsically consists of two phases in the same material and is relatively easy to synthesize, scalable and non-toxic.They produced the material by ball milling a powdered mixture of copper, manganese, germanium and sulfur to form Cu₂₊ₓMn₁₋ₓGeS₄ that exhibited interconnected enargite-type and stannite-type nanodomains. Using a combination of experimental and ab-initio electron and phonon calculation researchers have studied the structure-property relationships to explain the role of two crystal structures and their interfaces and underlying mechanisms of electronic and thermal transport in the material. Interestingly, they found that when Mn²⁺ is replaced with Cu⁺, it demonstrated a remarkable enhancement in the power factor and figure of merit (ZT) owing to the formation of complex microstructures with interconnected nanodomains, defects, and coherent interfaces, that affected the material's electronic and thermal transport properties. To understand the material's complex crystal structure and nanostructure, researchers utilized a set of experimental techniques including X-ray diffraction, high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and precession electron diffraction tomography that revealed interconnected enargite-type and stannite-type crystal structures via the formation of nanodomains with a high density of coherent interfaces. Phase-contrast imaging, HAADF-STEM, selected area diffraction and EDX measurements were performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Talos F200S S/TEM operated at 200 keV and precession electron diffraction tomography (PEDT) measurements were performed on a JEOL F200 S/TEM operated at 200 keV and equipped with a CFEG electron source and an Amsterdam Scientific Instruments CheeTah M3 hybrid-pixel single-electron counting direct electron detector to record PEDT datasets. Read the interesting findings published in Angewandte Chemie.https://lnkd.in/dBwrcJuJJEOL USAJEOL EUROPEJEOL Ltd.#thermoelectricmaterials #electrucitygeneration #heattoelectricity #interconnectednanodomains #enargite #stannite #interfaces #structurepropertyrelationships #microstructure #electrontransport #heattransport #abinitiocalculations #XRD #phasecontrastimaging #HAADF #SAD #EDX #STEM #PEDT #TalosF200S #F200 #CheeTahM3 #directelectrondetector #singleelectroncounting #electronmicroscopy

WELL-BEING WEDNESDAY!!All four of these are great reasons to get a massage! If you even need a reason….🤷🏻‍♀️😉Sandals are unsupportive to your body and usually lead to leg and back pain and tension after a long period of use. 🩴 Extra activity often puts strain on muscles that are not used to such exertion. 💪🏻 Seasonal depression (aka SAD) responds well to physical touch and we can blend you oils to support your emotional health at home between treatments. 🫣Regular massage can help to reset your circadian rhythm or sleep cycle. We also have many oils that can be blended to safely support restful sleep. 😴 (No - I’m not talking about lavender either!)So message me today and let’s get you feeling your best again for the coming winter season! 🤗👣💆🏻‍♀️🕊#massagetherapy #sad #sleep #sandals #aromatherapy #wellbeing

𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐬, 𝐒.𝐀.𝐃 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞For some, the earlier and long nights are a key stressor for their autumnal and winter productivity. It is often joked that as it gets colder we want the summer to return, but for many this is an actual disorder or struggle. I don't personally mind Winter but I definitely find it harder to concentrate on my tasks once the sun sets but I still have 1.5-2 hours of work to go. This is because 1) I want to get in bed or eat a pie and gravy OR 2) it's usually raining or painfully cold to go outside.Here are 3 things I do to help my productivity and mood in the Winter months:𝟏. 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐦𝐲 𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐭 - I am the last person to tell you to put down a bowl of pasta but be conscious that during November-February we want to increase our Vitamin D and our energy. I still have my carbs but I'm mindful to overcompensate with my greens, pulses and grains.𝟐. 𝐇𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 - DO NOT underestimate what makes you happy. Being happy increases your serotonin levels and endorphins and produces dopamine, which we know from research improves productivity. These months can decrease our physical well being, so ensure your mental well being is level by doing little things, any things that make you internally happy.  𝟑. 𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞! - MANAGERS, TEAM LEADERS try and encourage your team and maybe introduce a monthly incentive or a project you can all get involved in. During these months we still have tasks to complete but we must ensure we have something to look forward to. An incentive is playful and that increases our dopamine too! 𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐚 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐲 is that with the cost of living being at a scary all time high, a lot of the S.A.D advise surrounds getting lamps to help regulate the day/your mood. This costs money that some may not have. So, once the sun sets and you still have meetings to do and tasks to complete, I advise if in the office to 1) be as collaborative as possible. Is there a way you can work with other team members to get through those last hours? Maybe take your meeting in real life walking around the office (if it's not confidential). If you're virtual, hop on a call with a team mate!𝐒𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐭𝐨, 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐰𝐡𝐨 𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞: 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝟒𝟔 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐂𝐡𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐚𝐬 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐤𝐤𝐚𝐡 𝐢𝐧 𝟑𝟗 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢'𝐦 𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐬 𝐟𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐮𝐩 𝐬𝐨𝐨𝐧!Painting: ("Love of Winter" Oil canvas 1914) George Wesley Bellows paints people from different classes & ages coming together enjoying what the Winter has to offer.#team #work #energy #project #money #help #leaders #wellbeing #productivity #festive #SAD #winter #advice #tips

How do you know if you are ready or not for a job?The moment you put yourself in the shoe of any employer and 95% of the time you give yourself a chance when assessing yourself fairly, then you are more than ready for the job. So next time you get rejected, don't feel sad or bad about yourself, it is not your fault or your skills issues, it is either the reference other applicants have or the lazy employer who doesn't carefully read your resume and what you put in it, from achievements, degrees, intern experience, projects, unique links that showcase your skills (codepen,codewars,github...), etc.#motivation #hiring #employer #employee #programming #computerscience #computer #hr #job #experience #entrylevel #softwaredeveloper #intern #sad #sadreality

Mitochondria play a central role in high school biology curricula as the engine fueling the life cycle of individual cells and, ultimately our tissues, organ systems and bodies. Perhaps less well known is the way mitochondria form dynamic networks with each other, able to change their size, shape and level of connectivity with other mitochondria to adapt to the ever-changing energy demands of the cell. In fact, mitochondria often combine into a single, larger organelle in a process called fusion, or split into two smaller organelles, which is known as fission.Ugochukwu Ihenacho, a doctoral student in the lab of Blake Hill, PhD, professor of biochemistry, studies a protein called Fis1 that plays a role in mitochondrial fission. He focuses on how this protein influences mitochondrial fission and how it may be influenced by mutations in genes that govern mitochondrial fusion and fission and have been connected to diseases of the nervous system.Ihenacho recently won the graduate student category in the MCW Postdoc Advisory Committee’s competition seeking the best scientific images created by MCW graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. His image captures mitochondria elongated after being deprived of nutrients in a sample of colorectal cancer cells.Research and imaging by ugochukwu IhenachoAnimation and sound design by Alexander BoyesImage key:Purple: nuclei (DAPI stain)Cyan: lipid droplets (oil-red O stain)Sepia: mitochondria networks (TOM20 stain)#ArtofScience #ProjectWonder #MCWKnowledge #ScienceArt #ArtinScience #MedicalArt #ArtofMedicine #MedicalScience #Mitochondria #Cells

Post pandemic employers need to understand that feelings always translate to actions or behaviors. It's important to trigger the right feelings in their employees.There are six categories of feelings and when triggered will produce certain behaviors and actions in employees. To understand why your employees act the way they do, trace their behaviors back to their feelings and the trigger.1. Happy: Employees are happy when they are treated with respect and dignity.2. Scared: Employees are scared when threatened and intimidated.3. Anxious: Employees are anxious when stressed and overwhelmed by work.4. Sad: Employees are sad when they are excluded and passed for promotion.5. Mad: Employees become mad when their dignity is violated.6. Loved: Employees feel loved when they are accepted, included, and valued. Thank you Praveen Ponnuru  #work #happy #scared #anxious #sad #mad #loved #employees #checkup #checkin

At first glance, sadness may seem like a permanent condition, something that willalways be present in our lives and a constant source of pain and heartache. 😫But just like everything else in life, sadness is not here to stay. It is here to pass. No matter what comes our way in this world, we must learn to weather the storm- to deal with disappointment without becoming completely overcome by it. After all, nothing is permanent. 👈Challenges come and go as quickly as they arrive, and it is up to us to put the upsand downs into perspective and remember that they do not define us or dictatehow we live our lives. Instead of letting sadness weigh you down, learn to embrace it as an opportunityfor growth and understanding so you can continue moving forward on yourjourney through life with strength and resilience. 🧘#hardtime #love #life #hardtimes #motivation #sad #hardships#dealingwithissues #instagood #support #energy #anxietyrelief #quotes#benessere #bhfyp #calm #emotions #relaxation #insomnia #counseling #coach

When we say“It’s OK to be sad” to our children, our relatives, our friends we really do need to Believe it. We need to Feel it. .We have I’m sure, all heard someone say one thing but their body language, their behaviour their actions - said something completely different..This is unsettling & confusing but especially so for children. .Be truthful particularly around emotions; the consequence of not being truthful can lead to confusion, embarrassment, awkwardness & sometimes shame. .Often our beliefs around sadness and grief are inherited from past generations. Sometimes the belief is:“men/boys don’t cry.” “No good crying over spilt milk.”“You need to be strong for your…”.Sometimes we need to ask ourselves is this really emotionally healthy for me - or for the person struggling?.If you would like to know more about the ‘loss-supporting’ services I deliver please get in touch.www.dawnford.co.ukdawn@dawnford.co.uk@drjuliesmith.#healthy #emotions #feelings #grief #bereavement #children #family #sad #grieving #truth

ممكن ما نحس بالوجع؟ 😫💊 | BENDAfactsCongenital insensitivity to pain is a rare disorder, first described in 1932 by Dearborn as Congenital pure analgesia. Congenital insensitivity to pain and anhydrosis (CIPA) is a very rare and extremely dangerous condition. People with CIPA cannot feel painMost people afflicted with the disorder do not live past age 3, though not all deaths are due to the lack of pain. In fact, half of CIPA deaths are due to overheating because of the person's inability to produce sweat. This causes hyperthermia, or extremely elevated body temperature, which then leads to death#pain #love #health #life #sad #chronicpain #quotes #anxiety #depression #broken #art #fitness #wellness #poetry #backpain #instagram #hurt #brokenheart #painrelief #naruto #feelings #mentalhealth #motivation #sadness #chronicillness #alone #physicaltherapy #healing #instagood #physiotherapy

In my office there are no windows, and most of the time it feels like a super secret cabin, where no one knows i'm here and I can be as productive (or unproductive) as I like.  But at this time of year, where daylight is limited, it can feel as though I spend most of my time in the dark. It's more important at this time of year that I allow myself a break at midday, to go outside and breathe fresh air see daylight and do something I enjoy. Sometimes I walk the dog, or I might have a coffee and sit by the window watching the world go by. I might phone a friend and have a catch up. Seasonal Affective Disorder can be everything from feeling down and sleeping a lot, up to full blown depression. Motivation to get outside or interact with others in a positive way won't be found under the duvet. But the more you do those positive things the more you'll feel motivated to do them again. Spending two minutes today outside in daylight hours, will make you feel motivated to spend 4 minutes tomorrow, and 6 minutes the day after. If you push yourself today, the ball is rolling...journal how you felt afterwards, and anytime you feel that negative self-talk telling you to stay under the duvet/hide in your office, you can read your journal and see how you feel after you've achieve something.#sad #seasonalaffectivedisorder #lowmood #autumnvibes #winter #selfcare #selfcaretips #wellness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealth #employeewellbeing #employeewellness #employeewellnessprograms #motivation

According to research by Thriveworks, seasonal depression is expected to reach its peak this week (the first week of November). 2022’s search trends are tracking 30.17% higher than last year's 2021. Although we know that everyone experiencing SAD won't necessarily contact a mental health professional, there is a greater chance that they WILL go to a PCP office for one reason or another (cold, flu, injury, annual physical, etc). Ideally, universal screening for depression would increase the likelihood that those dealing with SAD would be identified and treated. #depressionscreening #depression #anxiety #anxietyscreening #GAD #MDD #PPD #postpartum #postpartumdepression #panicdisorder #socialanxietydisorder #socialanxiety #OCD #obsessivecompulsivedisorder #screeningsaves #accessgranted #integratedcare #collaborativecare #primarycare #mentalhealthcare #behavioralhealth #behavioralhealthcare #digitalhealth #healthtech #seasonsalaffectivedisorder #SAD

Understanding and Preventing Seasonal DepressionWinter is coming. Start now to prevent the winter blues.If these stereotypes about cold and darkness are more mythology than mechanisms for understanding SAD, what provides a better explanation? And how can we translate a more accurate explanation of SAD into more effective prevention and treatment?It turns out that SAD is better understood using a biopsychosocial model (see figure below; 5). This model includes biological components (gene expression, changes in neurotransmitters, hormones, vitamins levels, etc., during winter months), psychological dimensions (e.g., expectations about SAD, early life experiences and traumas during winter months), and behavior patterns (reduced exercise and outdoor time, disrupted sleep cycles, changes in diet and eating patterns, etc.). Although none of these factors in isolation accounts for overall SAD risk, in combination, they offer actionable insights into how an individual can understand their personal SAD risk and what steps they can take for prevention and treatment.Once again, however, the key takeaway from the biopsychosocial SAD model is the potential for individualized risk mitigation. Among people with a history of SAD or SAD symptoms, now is the ideal time to initiate a SAD prevention program. In personalized ways, this prevention program should include individual strategies for maintaining regular exercise, consistent sleep routines, outdoor time during sunlight hours (sunlight effects are powerful even on cloudy or overcast days), social contact, and healthy nutrition habits during the winter months. Not only will this program help you prevent or at least minimize SAD symptoms, it may also help you author a holiday season filled with adventure, connection, and great memories. To learn about myths around Seasonal Affective Disorder read the entire article "Understanding and Preventing Seasonal Depression"written by Thomas Rutledge Ph.D. https://lnkd.in/gJDM6df7 which can be found on the Psychology Today website:https://lnkd.in/gHzuVhMMIf you could use help with customizing your nutrition to prevent Seasonal Affective Disorder call LighthouseTherapy to get a free 15-minute consultation with Emily Dorko at 833-749-3549 Ext 702.Video by Artem Podrez https://lnkd.in/gVEZ2WYg (IG @poarts): https://lnkd.in/gTgBJSbq#winterblues #winter #seasonalaffectivedisorder #sad #blues #mentalhealth #combatingsad #seasonaldepression #selfcare #exercise #fitness #workout #nutrition #fitness #health #nutritionist #healthylifestyle #healthychoices #bettersleep #insomnia #sleeptips #sleephealth

According to research by Thriveworks, seasonal depression is expected to reach its peak this week (the first week of November). 2022’s search trends are tracking 30.17% higher than last year's 2021. Although we know that everyone experiencing SAD won't necessarily contact a mental health professional, there is a greater chance that they WILL go to a PCP office for one reason or another (cold, flu, injury, annual physical, etc). Ideally, universal screening for depression would increase the likelihood that those dealing with SAD would be identified and treated. #depressionscreening #depression #anxiety #anxietyscreening #GAD #MDD #PPD #postpartum #postpartumdepression #panicdisorder #socialanxietydisorder #socialanxiety #OCD #obsessivecompulsivedisorder #screeningsaves #accessgranted #integratedcare #collaborativecare #primarycare #mentalhealthcare #behavioralhealth #behavioralhealthcare #digitalhealth #healthtech #seasonsalaffectivedisorder #SAD

As the days begin to shorten more people are at risk for seasonal depression. Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) is a biological and mood disorder than affects many people during the fall and winter months. SAD can be presented in many different ways which may include feelings of loneliness, difficultly concentrating, diminished interest in activities, sleep problems, changes in eating habits,  low energy, and many others. You can overcome SAD, by making plans to socialize with friends and family, let in natural light where possible, keeping your sleep and wake cycles consistent, practicing mindfulness, and including self-care in your daily routine. #seasonalaffectivedisorder #sad #seasonaldepression #winter #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare

To close out our S.A.D series on tips to help with Seasonal Affective Disorder, we're suggesting exercise! Have troubles committing to an exercise routine? Maybe find a buddy or buddies to exercise with and keep you accountable as well as make it fun! Maybe set your goal for only once or twice a month then work your way up to once or twice a week. Setting realistic goals and having accountability can help you reach those goals. Exercising is also very beneficial to you, your body, and your mental health. This may help motivate you to be active! Does anyone have any exercise activities they enjoy? Or have any routines/ motivation to help someone out?#PhysicalHealth #MentalHealth #Exercise #Yoga #Bike #healthbenefits #SADSeries #HoustonCounseling #SAD #SeasonalAffectiveDisorder #wellbeing #JEM #Wellness

ডিপ্রেশন যেকোনো অনাকাঙ্ক্ষিত ঘটনা আমাদের মন খারাপ করে দেয়। এটি খুবই স্বাভাবিক। কিন্তু এই মন খারাপের মাত্রা কিংবা স্থায়িত্ব যখন স্বাভাবিকের চেয়ে বেশি হয়ে যায়, তখন সেটিকে বলে ডিপ্রেশন।যে ডিপ্রেশনের পেছনে আপাতদৃষ্টিতে কোনো কারণ পাওয়া যায় না, তাকে বলে Endogenous বা বায়োলজিকাল ডিপ্রেশন। আর যে ডিপ্রেশনের পেছনে কোনো সুনির্দিষ্ট ঘটনা বা সমস্যা পাওয়া যায়, সেটি হলো Reactive depression.ডিপ্রেশনের কারণ হিসেবে এককথায় বলা যায় সেরোটনিনের হ্রাস। কথায় বলে, 'Serotonin is happiness.' যদিও সেরোটনিন ছাড়া আরও নিউরোট্রান্সমিটারের (যেমন- ডোপামিন, নরইপিনেফ্রিন, গাবা ইত্যাদি) তারতম্য ঘটে থাকে। তবুও সবচেয়ে বেশি প্রভাব হচ্ছে সেরোটনিনের।লিঙ্গভেদেও ডিপ্রেশনের তারতম্য দেখা যায়। সাধারণত ছেলেদের চেয়ে মেয়েদের ডিপ্রেশন হওয়ার হার দ্বিগুণ। এর কারণ হিসেবে অনেকগুলো হাইপোথিসিস আছে। এক, মেয়েরা স্বভাবগতভাবেই তাদের কষ্টের অনুভূতিগুলো মনের মধ্যে চেপে রাখে। যেটা পরবর্তীতে প্রকাশ পায় ডিপ্রেশন আকারে। দুই, বিভিন্ন সমাজে প্রথাগতভাবেই ডমেস্টিক ভায়োলেন্সের শিকার বেশি হয় মেয়েরা। তিন, মেয়েদের হরমোনাল তারতম্য।লক্ষণগুলো নিম্নরূপ১.

Diminished Interest বা pleasure, অর্থাৎ কোনো কাজেই আগ্রহ বা আনন্দ না পাওয়া। ৩. খাওয়ার রুচি কমে যাওয়া বা বেড়ে যাওয়া কিংবা স্বাভাবিক খাওয়া-দাওয়ার পরও ওজনের তারতম্য হওয়া।৪. ঘুমের ব্যাঘাত ঘটা অথবা অতিরিক্ত ঘুমানো।৫. অতিরিক্ত উত্তেজনা অথবা একেবারে ঝিম ধরে থাকা।৬. শারীরিকভাবে দুর্বল লাগা।৭. নিজেকে ভীষণ রকমের অযোগ্য মনে হওয়া অথবা অযাচিত অপরাধবোধে ভোগা।৮. কাজে-কর্মে মনোযোগ দিতে না পারা অথবা সিদ্ধান্তহীনতা।ইত্যাদি।এছাড়াও আরো ভিন্ন রকম লক্ষন দেখা দিতে পারে।অনেক সময় এ মনোযোগহীনতার ব্যাপারটি পেশেন্ট এভাবে নিয়ে আসে যে, 'ইদানীং সবকিছু ভুলে যাচ্ছি । আসলে প্রধান সমস্যা এখানে ভুলে যাওয়া নয়, কাজ করার সময় যথাযথ মনোযোগ দিতে না পারার কারণে পরবর্তীতে সেই বিষয়টি ব্যক্তি আর মনে করতে পারেন না।৯. জীবনকে অর্থহীন মনে হওয়া, মরে যেতে ইচ্ছা করা, অনেক ক্ষেত্রে আত্মহত্যার পরিকল্পনা থাকা কিংবা সুনির্দিষ্ট পরিকল্পনা ছাড়াও আত্মহত্যার ইচ্ছা অথবা ইতোমধ্যে কোনো সুইসাইডঅ্যাটেম্পটের হিস্ট্রি থাকা।লক্ষণগুলোর মধ্যে যদি অন্তত ৫টি বা তার বেশি লক্ষণ (যাদের মধ্যে একটি অবশ্যই প্রথম দুটির একটি) যদি কোনো ব্যক্তির মধ্যে অন্তত ২ সপ্তাহ বা তার বেশি সময় ধরে থাকে এবং এগুলো তার ব্যক্তিগত, পারিবারিক, সামাজিক জীবনযাত্রায় ব্যাঘাত ঘটায়, তবেই তাকে আমরা Major Depressive Disorder বলব।মনে রাখবেন, 'দৈনন্দিন কর্মকাণ্ডে ব্যাঘাত ঘটা' বিষয়টি খুব গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। কেননা, অনেকেইআছেন যারা লক্ষণগুলো নিয়েও হয়তো নিজেদের দৈনন্দিন স্বাভাবিক কর্মকাণ্ড চালিয়ে যেতে#কন্যা #konna #depression #anxiety #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #love #sad #mentalillness #mentalhealthmatters #selfcare #ptsd #selflove #therapy #life #depressed #healing #recovery #stress #quotes #motivation #suicide #health #trauma #bipolar #sadness #mindfulness #psychology #wellness #pain #depressionhelp #broken

EACH ENDING IS THE BIRTH OF A NEW BEGINNINGWhen we come to the ending of something we can feel sad at its completion and often try to prolong it beyond it's natural time .On the surface we seem sad because we miss the person , place or experience and don't want  this feeling to pass. Yet at its root the cause for this sadness is has a deeper explanation. Normally when we engage life we are looking to get something from it and so we manipulate our own authentic expression in order to do this. However the reason this doesn't work is that instead of feeling complete in our engagement we compromise ourselves, and wish to get something in return. When it ends before we feel this trade is complete, we feel the payoff has not been worth the cost, and that resentment causes our upset.The alternative way of interacting with life is to show up authentically without an agenda. Instead of looking to get something we can use each moment to share the authentic expression of who we are. Because there is no suppression or manipulation for a reward, there is no investment . So we are fulfilled fully in each interaction without need for repayment. In this case , when an experience ends , we don't resist and instead of sadness at its ending we are excited allowing space for an optimistic new beginning.

***Some may understand, others eventually and some may never realize it. But the design, the plan that we were instructed and deemed necessary to follow ultimately was not of choice. We were trained to be survivalist of the RAT RACE, told it is just the way it is and deemed necessary to survive not thrive in this world. But do you ever think or wonder what it can be, what it would look like if you jumped out of the hamster wheel and did other things? Took risks, took chances, made your own choices, learned what works and what doesn’t, create your own set of rules, create the life you ultimately want to live and not the one they have designed for us? Its a matter of unlearning to relearn what we were not told and or showed. Its a sad reality but so many people are living like this day in and day out. Get out of the RAT RACE when you can, I DARE YOU!***••••#facts #reality #life #lifestyle #ratrace #rats #hampsterwheel #revolving #crazy #realtalk #fact #sad #truth #crazy #money #survival #success #learn #school #work #reelsinstagram #reels #explorepage #thefinancialchauffeur

The start of winter always brings challenges – the clocks going back, shorter days, miserable weather, flu season and post-holiday blues: they all combine to a drop in morale, fatigue and a consequent drop in energy. The winter blues and Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) are not just a myth. Read our latest blog https://lnkd.in/e6yny3wm#sad #ppe #ppeproducts #ppesupplier
-----------------------------
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a transitory type of depression that affects millions of people every year. 🌨 Research suggests that the condition is triggered by a lack of sunlight during the autumnal and winter months and can not only lower serotonin levels, but also increase melatonin production; making sufferers feel especially tired all day. One completely natural treatment for SAD is light therapy, where patients sit in front of special UV lightboxes for a half-an-hour first thing in the morning from fall until the beginning of spring. ☀ Learn more about how to use light therapy and other naturopathic treatments for SAD at the link.#sad #depression #seasonalaffectivedisorder #mentalhealth #naturalmedicine
