Flying away from the Nest and setting off for new adventures on the other side of the planet 🗺️This day marks a couple of important milestones:-         My first post ever on LinkedIn 🚀 (Is this really a milestone?)-         My last day working at Nestlé-         The beginning of a new and exciting journey 😍I am thrilled to announce that I’ll be moving to New Zealand as of February 2023 (#excited). Driven by the willingness to enrich ourselves as individuals, to go out of our comfort zone, to experience a new professional and personal environment, and to discover new outdoor experiences, my partner and I have decided to take that step. And why not?Since I graduated from ISIPCA in 2014, the past decade at Nestlé (wow, this sounds like a lot) which started with a 2-years internship has been incredibly rich and I feel very lucky for all the projects and experiences I went through. I met inspiring people and worked on innovative projects. From being part of the Nestlé R&D accelerator to the nesQino™️ journey, and plenty of other initiatives, I enjoyed the diversity of projects, activities, and challenges.The journey has also sometimes been punctuated with some doubts and questions, which were essential to go the extra mile. Those who know me know that I am always eager to learn new things. I don’t know yet what will come next, and I am very curious to see what the future will bring… The next two months will be busy organizing the move (and solving admin stuff), enjoying time with family and friends, recharging, and settling in New Zealand. I’ll be available for work as of February 2023 and I can’t wait to discover what New Zealand has to offer. I would love to start discussions about expatriation experiences, tips about New Zealand, potential work opportunities (including remote), …

WARNING: This post will be boring...but may be my best post of the past yearYesterday was a fantastic day with my direct reports covering 2023 business plans. Financials, employee compensation, performance metrics, process changes, and ways to improve our business. And a lot about our #DAIRYCulture. It was engaging the entire day, and everyone spoke up and had ideas and opinions to share. There was a high level of trust, honesty, respect and debate. It was one of those meetings that as a leader, you can't help but feel #excited for what we're building here!As a supervisor I walked away feeling proud of the people I have on my team and how we're going to accomplish our plans for next year.I can't wait to get it done!

This is me checking out a new therapy option for mental-health at one my good friend Don Vaughn, Ph.D. garage office. This is the true essence of #siliconvalley - innovative, resourceful and hardworking entrepreneurs trying to change the world. It is not the 100s of VC firms or 1000s of incredibly talented engineers that keep #siliconvalley ahead of the game. It is because of the incredible innovations happening in the humble garages where entrepreneurs, powered by the passion to make a difference and not willing to accept status-quo, are working 24x7, . #excited for how far Don Vaughn, Ph.D.. and his team has come in the last few months. For a hardware solution, I am super impressed on what they have been able to deliver in 6 months.I recall the discussion with Don when they were starting - I tried to convince him to make this treatment exclusive for commercial reasons. His stance - "I don't know, I think I want to share it with everyone who needs it. I want everyone to be able to overcome mental health challenges." True to his words - they have been focused on making it an accessible treatment for everyone. #mentalhealth #executionexcellence #entrepreneurs

I am extremely #proud and #excited to share with you our latest #research on data collaboratives "Together, we can: Fast-forwarding healthcare through data collaboratives" for which I had the honour of being a co-author alongside my colleagues Alexandros Giannakis, Deni Subasic and Fabian Gautschi.😊🎉🎊  Exponential proliferation of health data generated by technical and scientific advances has the potential to fast-forward healthcare and precision medicine. Unfortunately, much of this data remains siloed, hindering realization of the value for patients and other healthcare ecosystem participants. Life sciences companies are thus increasingly turning to data collaboratives (DCs) to break siloes and access high quality data from their ecosystem partners. This new way of partnering unleashes synergies and leads to pioneering insights driving progress in oncology and other disease areas. To understand the implications, and benefits of DCs, we surveyed 59 heads of oncology across the US and Europe.Read more on our survey results with heads of oncology across the US and Europe, and the typical challenges they encountered in setting up data collaboratives. Furthermore, we have identified and addressed these challenges, and identified key accelerators, success factors and strategies that are vital for the successful establishment of a data collaborative. ➡https://lnkd.in/exFH3Ukq ⬅ One key insight up front: Most of our respondents agree strongly that DCs generate significant value for patient and research outcomes. 🏆 I would love to hear your opinion on this research and this new way of partnership in the healthcare industry - would be happy to discuss this topic over a cup of ☕Happy weekend!#datacollaborative #healthcare #precisionmedicine #personalizedmedicine #realworlddata #oncology #innovation #datainhealthcare #lifescience #health #data #research

What did you promise yourself in December 2021 about what you are going to accomplish in 2022?  To get that certificate? To finally find a meaningful job? To nail that promotion? To read more? To invest in your personal development? To change the world? To get out of that relationship? OR to finally pursue that dream you've harnessed for the past few years.How have you got on?I promised myself that I would make this year, a year of getting closer to my goal of being a Life Manifestation coach.I created my vision board, (right in the center) and I knew I'd have to take uncomfortable actions.And my goodness, what a year. You see I stood inside a powerful Intention to be that as a possibility.When you create a Powerful Intention, one that has the hairs on your body stand to attention, the Universe also wants you to have it because the Universe is a huge intention fulfillment machine. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Tony Robbins, Dean Graziosi, and the like all knew that they would be successful, and do what they can to make it happen, they trusted the Universe will provide the resources, the people, the ideas, and the opportunities to have that intention realized.The acorn has within it the intention of becoming an oak tree. When all the conditions are present for it to fulfill its intention, the oak tree shall appear. You are no different. I am no different.I'm excited, I feel alive....and I feel scared. Incredible. If my last hours on earth were here, I'd be able to say.... I tried Lord.What do you say? #excited #livelifeonpurpose #youonlyliveonce I hope to see you 24th November at the Europa Hotel, Belfasthttps://lnkd.in/eMt3X7nc

The typical struggle of a freelancer and a startup owner.So , This post is shout out for All the Artists..All the Freelancers...All the Content Creators  and many more...If you need to have a  Full time Job..Do It.

The story behind #vandebharatexpressLike many Bangaloreans & Indians, I am super #excited  about the flagging off of India's 5th & south #india 's first #vandebharatexpress  by PM #narendramodiji  on 11-Nov-2022. The train (like Shatabdi) will connect #mysuru  & #chennai .The idea of this train came up in 2015 when #indianrailways  was looking to increase the average speed of trains from 85kmph to 150kmph. Cause higher speed will mean more trains which will lead to more efficiency & more revenue.A tender was floated and a company from SPAIN was shortlisted for trials. 10 coaches would cost 250 crores ($31.25m).That's when an abnormal request for the pre-retirement posting of a senior officer reached the Railway Board Chairman.Generally in #indianrailways, the pre-retirement posting is given based on the individual's preferences to enable the employee to build a house, settle down and prepare for their retired life.This person was from Lucknow but had requested posting at Integral Coach Factory (ICF) Perambur, Chennai. So the chairman wished to meet the official to understand the reason for such a request.On discussing with this gentleman he got to know that this official wanted to go to Chennai for a special purpose. He wanted to build the semi-high-speed train. This was his parting gift to the country.He requested a budget of INR 100 crores for 16 coaches (40% of the cost of the coaches from SPAIN that were being tested as they spoke).It was 2016, the transfer was approved and the budget was allocated. The official put together an R&D team and they worked tirelessly for 2 years. What came out was TRAIN 2018 or TRAIN-18.They had built it on the EMU (electrical multiple unit) model, so it would not need an #engine  to lug it around, each coach would propel & stop itself. So it was more efficient & faster to accelerate & deaccelerate.AC Coaches with fully automatic doors, onboard WiFi, GPS based passenger info system, luggage racks, auto-sensor taps (like in malls), sockets for charging mobile phones & laptops, passenger reading lights (like in planes), diffused LED lighting and many more.The VANDE BHARAT express is like a rare diamond designed & developed in India for India by an ambitious Indian who decided to give his best before he retired from the company where he spent his entire life.The name of this official is Sudhanshu Mani. He retired in 2018.I wish to thank him on behalf of 1.4billion Indians.Koti koti pranam to this #realheroes  of #bharat  to have had the courage to take up this ambitious project to #makeinindia , leading to #aatmanirbharbharat #challengesareopportunities

WowThis actually happened in Malta! Those 3 days went by so quick!Thank you to all the attendees at my “YOUR TIME Business Retreat” I hosted the other week, for trusting in me. It was fantastic to meet people face to face, some for the first time and others that I hadn’t seen for a few years!!! You were all amazing and I feel humbled, grateful, excited for you and honoured to have been able to help you. So what did everyone accomplish?Well everyone including myself, worked on:- Their VISION- NEW BUSINESS generation - Our TRUSTED NETWORK of people - TAKING CONTROL of our diary- MENTAL WELLNESS at work - And we had some FUN too!So the background to this event. Eleven months ago I had a Vision to host my own Business Retreat. Why?To help business owners realise the importance of investing in themselves to create a sustainable successful business, while enjoying a spectacularly amazing lifestyle. So the ball started rolling in December 2021, while planning my 2022 diary. First ACTION was setting the date of the 28 - 30 September and blocking it out in my diary. ✅Why then? I worked it around my commitments and existing diary plans for 2023. #takecontrol Next steps were:- Writing down everything I wanted the attendees to have achieved at the end of the 3 days. ✅- Deciding on what actions I would need to take to make it happen ✅- Identify who I would need to speak to and support me in the build up and at the event ✅- Who did I specifically want to help and believed would benefit from attending ✅- Research and source the right venue for the event through my network here in Malta ✅And then September soon arrived and it was great to welcome my guests at the AX The Palace hotel and Malta - my home!At this point I would like to also say a big thank you 🙏 to my own coach (#weallneedone) Phillip Burton  who helped and supported me in making this retreat a success for everyone. And of course my wife, who helped and hosted a wonderful Maltese family dinner evening for us all. The 3 days of everyone focused on their own time and needs, went so well we’ve already scheduled and started planning 2 more retreats for 2023! Some of the attendees have actually already blocked out the dates in their diary and reserved their places to return! 🙏If you want to know more information too, simply comment with a yes and I’ll be in touch with all the info you need.Phil and I are really #excited about helping and making a difference to even more likeminded professional business people. #yourtime #businessretreat #relationshipmarketing #businesscoach #betterlife #moretime #cashflow #diary #newbusiness #businessdevelopment #marketing #malta #bni #networking #worklifebalance #mentalhealth #fun #vision
