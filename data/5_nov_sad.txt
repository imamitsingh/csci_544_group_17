❄️11 TOP TIPS TO MANAGE WINTER SAD❄️Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that you may experience during particular seasons of the year, and it can be very common when the clocks go back, because of the shorter, darker and colder days. As a result, it can make it difficult to keep up with morning and evening routines.If not managed, this can affect your everyday life.These shorter days and change in weather can zap your energy and make you feel low. So if you’ve noticed that you lack energy at the moment and feel particularly low, maybe you have SAD.What can you do about it❓️This article written in the Metro👇 has some useful suggestions and here are my 11 TOP TIPS:❄️   Talk to someone who will listen and not judge you - This could be a therapist, coach, doctor, or trusted friend. Talking can be a great way to get things off your mind and make sense of it.❄️   Focus on your mindset – Participate in mood-boosting activities, especially something you enjoy.❄️   Try bright light therapy – These are devices called phototherapy boxes that mimics sunshine. Sit in front of it for around 20 minutes a day. This can boost your energy and lift your mood.❄️   Prioritise social activities – Fill your winter months with enjoyable activities. This may make you feel less isolated.❄️   Essential oils – These can help with anxiety and sleep problems. I recommend Frankincense, because it can act as a sedative and relaxes you. I also like Rose Geranium, because it is instantly calming.❄️  Stick to a schedule – This can improve sleep, which can alleviate symptoms of SAD.❄️  Get moving – exercise releases happy hormones.❄️  Open the curtains – Getting as much Vitamin D as possible is important, but if you can’t get out, take a supplement and get as much natural light into the room as possible.❄️  Plan a winter holiday – Having something to look forward to can boost your mood. If you can, book some winter sun.❄️  Journal – writing down your thoughts can have a positive effect on your mood.❄️  Anti-depressants – If other treatments aren’t working, maybe a low dose of medication for a short term could be recommended. Talk to you doctor.What things do you do to boost your mood❓️#SAD #nationalstressawarenessday #mentalhealthawareness #seniorexecutive #bestadvice

Are you suffering from SAD?      I love Autumn. It’s definitely my favourite season. I love the colder air, the colour of the trees, and I enjoy raking leaves and chopping wood. It suits my mood. Late autumn, like me, is a mixture of optimism and melancholy.  But not everyone likes this time of year. Many really start to struggle when the clocks go back and darkness descends earlier in the late afternoon. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) has been recognised for many years.  Solutions range from vitamin D to light boxes.My prescription, however, is to embrace the season. There’s a real joy in being in the open air. Whether it’s cold, bright, and crisp or very cold, dark, and wet there is always something to be gained from being outdoors. Too often we rush from office to car and from car to home. We’re cold and wet because we’re wearing the wrong type of clothes. We’re rarely allowing ourselves to be part of what autumn isall about.   One of the biggest issues that many of us face is the inability to live in the moment. Just ask any coach or therapist and they’ll all agree. Too many people are constantly reliving and replaying the past or thinking ahead to the future. Getting people to sit still and be comfortable with themselves in the here and now is really difficult. The pressures of work and the constant demands of family life mean that there’s rarely an opportunity to focus on what Eckhart Tolle calls the Power of Now. And autumn is a good example of now. Rather than dream of summers past or look ahead to Christmas, we should stop rushing from warm car to centrally-heated house and learn to accept the true joys that autumn can offer. A good example of living in the moment is my swimming. A couple of times a week, first thing in the morning, I swim in a lake. It takes me 15 minutes or so to get there. During the journey I focus on my breathing and mentally rehearse how cold the water is going to be (especially as I am stubbornly wearing neither wet suit norgloves). And the thing about cold water is that you can’t think about the past and you can’t think about the future. Visualising lying in a hammock on a summer day or thinking about your post-swim hot shower is of no help. The only way to cope with the cold water is to fully embrace it. You have to be in the moment. It’s cold (or extremely cold) and that’s that.  So, my prescription is embrace the season for all it offers. And here’s one little trick that I recommend. Each day, I put my phone away and sit outside to have my coffee. Whatever the weather, I breathe, and look at the trees. And today I will smile to myself as I think of these marvellous words from PG Wodehouse: “It was one of those days you sometimes get latish in the autumn when the sun beams, the birds toot, and there is a bracing tang in the air that sends the blood beetling brisklythrough the veins.”#SAD #openwaterswimming #coaching #liveinthemoment #leadershipdevelopment

"At night I put pieces of clothes in the holes of the wall.To avoid cold air and mosquitos.During the day, I take them off to receive sunlight.And catch a glimpse of my son's. Maybe they pass by the wall, and I can see any of them."These are the words of an old man who 6 months ago got his leg broken during his labour work at the age of 83.The room you see in the picture below is all his property.He has been there in this room for his life.He can't walk. Even can't move his leg.He has four sons. None of them visits him.Even though they live just behind his room in their own houses.They all are busy with their lives.I got tears in my eyes when he said, "if each of my sons gives me 500Pkr per month, it will be 2000Pkr. Which will be enough for me to bear my entire month's expenses [9 dollars per month]".But It's been months since I haven't even seen the face of my sons, who live a few steps away from me.And his eyes got wet.__________________________________________________________________9 dollarssssss???????? Are they enough for an entire month's expenses???????????I was stunned.How????????But moving my eyes around the corners of his home, I mean room, I got my answer.Sitting there, I was thinking "the amount I charge for writing one Facebook ad copy can be 5X of someone's entire month's expenses. How unbelievable and sad at the same time"__________________________________________________________________He doesn't know if the leg bone is still broken or not.Because he cannot afford the X-ray or Doctor's fee.All he knows is that he is in extreme pain.He can't do the washroom easily. Can't walk.His 79 years old wife takes care of him.She works in a house as a maid and gets 2000 rupees per month.All is spent on medicine and taking care of his husband.She has sought a 12K rupees loan from the house she works as a maid to bear the medical expenses of his husband.She has to pay that money back as well.And they both live in this room.It's unbelievable.But I have witnessed it all with my own eyes.Since he is the man who used to be the servant of my grandfather and used to work on land for him.After my grandfather's death, he went jobless and still suffering after so many years.Imagine his helplessness, his pain.Lying all day, trying to catch a glimpse of his blood, his sons, whom he raised, through the holes of the wall.Life is not just or beautiful for everyone.Be a human, and don't live your whole life pursuing your own desires only.Trust me, the internal satisfaction you get after hugging such suffering people, after seeing the smile on their faces when you help them with some money or even your words, IS MATCHLESS.#poverty #injustice #helplessness #helpingpeople #tragic #sad

As the clocks have now gone back, it’s that time of year where some of us start to feel the effects of SAD.Over the years I’ve learned that prioritising my work to allow for regular lunchtime walks (to maximise daylight), socialising and generally being more active, have all helped me to manage this better.I have a SAD light as backup, for when I struggle to get out of the house enough, but nothing has yet beat the natural approach.Prioritise yourself, look after yourself and speak to people around you.#seasonalaffectivedisorder #SAD #mentalhealth

OK, so who managed to enjoy an extra hour of sleep this past weekend as we turned the clocks back by an hour at the end of BST?Experts believe that changing the clocks could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes and possibly even cause a surge in the number of car accidents – have you ever seen data to prove this?The effects are only temporary, a bit like jet lag, but because turning the clocks back can disrupt our circadian rhythm and, in turn, our sleep, bad moods, appetite changes, and even depression are possible side effects of changing the clocks.In particular, the change of clocks is thought to be one of the causes of SAD (seasonal affective disorder). The symptoms of SAD are very similar to depression, including a persistent low mood and difficulty concentrating.So, while the extra hour of sleep feels like a bonus, changing the clocks has a surprising effect on our bodies and our mindset. For me, it was a little discombobulating, and I hadn’t quite noticed it as much before as I did last year, so this year I tried something a little tactical to manage the event.I consciously eased in changes over 3 days – Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I shifted bedtime and waking time by just 20 minutes each day, I shifted mealtimes, and working hours, and my favourite one, I made really sure that I got 2 hours of sun on my face each day (melatonin regulation).I’m not usually very disciplined with any of those habits, but it was an interesting experiment for me, and felt good to be conscious of what was happening to my mind and body.#circadianrhythm #coaches #coaching #SAD #depression #bst #bodyclock

Deeply saddened to hear of how the employees in Twitter are learning about their fate today. It feels cold and cruel to me. Employees are human and have hearts. Surely there is a kinder and more respectufl way to deliver this difficult news to your people. I encountered a situation like this in my early 20's when working in NY and was shocked to see how loyal employees were told that they were unfortunately going to be made redundant and in the next moment walked to the exit door and passwords changed. This experience never left me. So hearing about this today brought this back to me but on a much larger scale. Not a good day for capitalism, and a sad day for all the impacted employees of Twitter. Thinking of you all today.#sad

Bittersweet day. Drove down to Austin for the funeral of my dear friend, Ray Avila. It was a sad and touching ceremony. Ray was a great guy who was loved by everyone who met him. But, there was also a bit of a reunion from my KFI days. That’s Mike Nolan “KFI in The Sky” on the left and former KFI/KOST production guy Gil Perez in the middle. Funny thing about me and Gil. We grew up on the same street, El Chino Circle, in Buena Park, CA. He’s a little older than me. But we ended up in the same career and working at a few of the same stations. Small world. It was nice to see them and spend some time catching up. I just wish it could’ve been under better circumstances. #radio #talkradio #kfi #broadcast #broadcasting #broadcastmedia #media #funeral #sad #friends #kost

Siumen, I just read your post on Silly Con Valley and Stanford. In 1993, when I had the first commercial version of my English NL syntactical Parser, parsing the sentence into Parts of Speech and Parts of the Sentence (Subject, Verb with all Verbal Tenses, Object - Direct, Indirect, Complement Object, Complement Subject, Verbal Complement, etc.) I saw Online, that Stanford University has NLP group. I sent them an e-mail to say hello, I am also working in this field, I have already developed that and that. They wrote to my website host, asking them to close my website, because I send them SPAM. Some years later, they released their own English NL Parser, later, they offered it as open source. This I write in confirmation of what you have said in this post. I  will add to it that some people cannot be cheerful unless they make under people sad. #sad #parsing #NLP

I write about Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) every year about the same time of year because as the light starts to fade and change, like many others,  I can struggle to cope. I need to be actively aware  as #SAD starts to take hold or I can quickly find myself in a rut.This year it started with fatigue, feeling jaded and I thought I was coming down with something. My motivation took a hit and although I knew I needed to get out the house and get a change of scenery coupled with some exercise. Getting a foot over the threshold of the door wasn't as easy as it sounds. Anyone who suffers from this will understand it's not easy and can quickly lead to depression if not combated. So here is my advice. - Organisation is key - Take Vitamin D and vitamin C supplementation - Stay well hydrated - Get enough sleep otherwise fatigue will exacerbate your situation - Make plans but involve others. So you have to get out and meet someone or you are inviting someone over - Exercise in a way you enjoy. Gym, yoga, exercise class,  walk, run,  cycle etc  and if you can, again organise this activity with someone then this will help and make you accountable to another. I do hope this helps some of you Don't forget that you are powerful Ps  if someone could start a go fund me page so I could live abroad for 4 months per year to skip winter that would be lovely ☺️ #sleep #seasonalaffectivedisorder #motivation #change #help #exercise #organised

दुनिया किसी को नहीं छोड़ती। हम सभी की जिंदगी में कुछ लोग ऐसे जरूर होते हैं, जिनका काम टांग खिंचाई करना, हमारा मज़ाक उड़ाना, हमें पीछे धकेलना या फिर नुकसान पहुंचाना होता है। पर, दुनिया यहीं तक नही होती। इससे साथ-साथ एक दुनिया वो भी है, जो हम अपने साथ बनाते चलते हैं।दूसरों की बातों पर ध्यान ना देकर, खुद के लिए जब हम कुछ करते हैं तो अपनी उस दुनिया को हम और बेहतर बनाते हैं। हर बार जब किसी मुसीबत या दुःख के बाद हम फिर से खड़े होते हैं, तो वो दुनिया और बड़ी और मज़बूत हो जाती है। अर्नेस्ट हेमिंग्वे कहते हैं, ‘दुनिया हर किसी को तोड़ती है, उन्हीं में से बहुत सारे लोग हैं, जो टूटने के बाद और भी मजबूत हो जाते हैं।’यदि तुम रुके तो असफलता निश्चित है। लक्ष्य की प्राप्ति की राह में बहुत सी रुकावटें आएँगी मगर हमे डरना नही है। अल्बर्ट आइंस्टीन ने कहा है कि, “हम तब तक नही हारते जब तक हम कोशिश करना नहीं छोड़ते” कामयाब होना कोई असम्भव चीज नहीं है। हम तब तक नही हारते जब तक हम कोशिश करना नहीं छोड़ते. बस ज़रूरत है तो सफलता के मूल मंत्रों को अपने भीतर विकसित करने की।Vikas P Uttank#success #world #happiness #health #sad #sadhguru #india #media #motivationalspeaker #motivation

Dumb.Biden cut down the Keystone Pipeline as his first action taken as President. That killed 13,000 jobs that paid over $100K per year and killed any hope for energy self sufficiency. Keystone Pipeline has been built from Alberta to the Can/US border. Parts of the Keystone have already been built in USA. Pipeline would have been in production in 2022.That pipeline was to carry Canadian heavy oil to Gulf Coast refineries to process into heating oil, jet fuel, gas and over 200 oil based products.Gulf refineries need raw materials to meet demand. Without pipeline, demand cannot be met- not enough supply.Result, heating oil shortage and now record high prices. This is going to absolutely gut business and household budgets in NE that use Heating oil.So now Biden offered up$12.5 B in new inflationary taxpayers money to offer subsidies to those who simply do not have the money to pay for Biden’s sky high heating oil.This is a disaster. If you live in the NE you know what I am talking about. It is Biden’s policies that have killed hard working honest Democrats the opportunity to win in next weeks elections.Democrats have proven that they simply do not know how to manage our economy nor have the listening and understanding DNA in their make up. #Sad.

Lying in hospital, I realised…Endings and beginnings. You can't have one without the other.My right leg suffered pain for what felt like an eternity. The pain was really excruciating  whenever I walked for long periods of time or in the cold.In July 2017 my leg started to swell and this never happened before. After months of consultations with doctors (NHS and Private), they finally found the problem by this time my leg has tripled in size.I was told by doctors they needed to operate as soon as possible and the dates they had were in December.The problem with these dates is that our son, could anytime late December and I wanted to be there for the birth.December 26 2017, our son Jeevan was born. I never felt such happiness before in my life. He was already teaching me great lessons and gave new meaning to terms such as love, care, laughter, joy, tears, etc.Then suddenly, the pain kicked back in my leg. It was almost as if the pain was trying to tell me something.You see, I had battled with the pain for so long that I became numb to it, which was not a good sign.Think about it, how many times have you been hurt or felt pain and somehow become somewhat numb to that pain?The lessons my pain taught me was this;“Pain may not be a pleasurable experience itself, but it builds our pleasure in ways that pleasure alone simply cannot achieve.”Without this pain, I would never have pushed myself to become fitter, health and stronger for myself, my son and family.I came out of surgery with a smile on my face, even though I could feel pain. I was even told that I would be on crutches for minimum three month, instead I stopped using them after two months.Why? because I let my mind heal my body through the knowing what is waiting for me on the other side.What’s ONE tip you’d share about your experience with pain?

The business owners Day Off … - Get the child ready for nursery - Go to a meeting - Have my hair done (more a chore than a luxury to be honest, and I work the entire time from my laptop!) - Help to hang a SALE banner up, outside in the wind & rain (hair got blown to bits!) - Go to work to follow up on some customer conversations about hot tubs, and action some marketing - Go out for dinner with a friend - talk about work, and life. - Home to Bed  #dayoff #alwaysworking #tired #commitment #business #sad #bedtime

Atlanta Medical Center was my first job as a Dietitian where I worked with a Provisional License until I passed my Registered Dietitian exam. For exactly one month a Senior RD signed off my progress notes and consults until I was able to sign the credentials RD, LD behind my name. AMC was a fast paced learning environment (not as super-paced like Grady Hospital a few blocks away) where all Interdisciplinary types of students, interns, Fellows, Residents came through to learn and practice their course of study. For me, I learned how to work with a high volume of patients with all types of nutritional concerns in my assigned ICU and med-surge floors. (My favorite task was managing tube/enteral feeds and my least favorite were calorie counts and Low Albumin consults 😖.) Nonetheless, I learned and saw a lot there. I worked with and made great friends with staff who I continue to keep in touch with today who are doing great in their prospective fields. AMC was one of my best jobs. I'm sad to see it close bc it provided great care to those in its community. #atlanta #amc #atlantamedicalcenter #atlantametro #hospital #dietitian #registereddietitian #clinicaldietitian #healthcare #rd #rdn #ld #ldn #firstjob #sad #goodbye

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a transitory type of depression that affects millions of people every year. 🌨 Research suggests that the condition is triggered by a lack of sunlight during the autumnal and winter months and can not only lower serotonin levels, but also increase melatonin production; making sufferers feel especially tired all day. One completely natural treatment for SAD is light therapy, where patients sit in front of special UV lightboxes for a half-an-hour first thing in the morning from fall until the beginning of spring. ☀ Learn more about how to use light therapy and other naturopathic treatments for SAD at the link.#sad #depression #seasonalaffectivedisorder #mentalhealth #naturalmedicine

From Projecthappiness.org:IT’S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY. Let’s talk about how hard it is to open up to someone about being sad for “no reason”, how hard it is to explain to your friends and family that you have a heavy feeling that you can’t seem to shake. You're not alone. Optimism is powerful and motivational. But let’s not get into Toxic Positivity Land and pretend that everything is good when it isn’t. Allow yourself to feel what you feel, which ironically helps you move through it. Share your struggles to give others the space to share theirs. You are not “negative” - you are human! And that’s a good thing, even though it can be hard. Know that ALL your feelings count.#happiness #positivepsychology #optimism #negativity #emotions #mindset #emotionalintelligence #selfawareness #coaching #selfcare #sad #stressmanagement

I am shocked I found one point I agree with @Elonmusk about (cos I just blocked him on my twitter again for nagging about $8 to all!) It takes a lot of trowelling around the manure of Harvard's outer China-complicity-crust to find the "gem" that reflects UN Bestpractices in the Harvard Business Review....I don't understand why it is such hard work for them to listen to their Own "Voice of Conscience" coming from within their own ranks (different institution).....still....when one finds it, one should show genuine endorsement of it. I approve this observation of ESG....the average midlevel management has about as much chance of living up to the SDG standards as "camel fitting through the eye of a needle"!

As the days begin to shorten more people are at risk for seasonal depression. Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) is a biological and mood disorder than affects many people during the fall and winter months. SAD can be presented in many different ways which may include feelings of loneliness, difficultly concentrating, diminished interest in activities, sleep problems, changes in eating habits,  low energy, and many others. You can overcome SAD, by making plans to socialize with friends and family, let in natural light where possible, keeping your sleep and wake cycles consistent, practicing mindfulness, and including self-care in your daily routine. #seasonalaffectivedisorder #sad #seasonaldepression #winter #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare

Today the clocks have changed for a reason!  When the clocks go back, the sun clock and the clock on the wall are back in alignment (midday is approximately the highest point of the sun) thus the sun/body clocks and clock on the wall are back in harmony today. Find out what you can do during winter months to feel better, despite the circadian rhythm being disturbed - a new article I wrote with Dr Annie Curtis from the Curtis Sleep Lab.#clocksgoback #circadianrhythm #positivepsychology #wellnesscoaching #wellnesslifestyle #wellbeing #winter2022 #sad #seasonalaffectivedisorder #depressionawareness #depression #depressionhelp

Just because someone looks different from you or has a different opinion doesn't mean you should write them off. In fact, you shouldn't judge anyone at all, including yourself!Here are five simple steps on how not to judge yourself and other people unfairly:1. 𝑫𝒐𝒏'𝒕 𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒖𝒎𝒆.Just because someone looks or acts a certain way doesn't mean you know everything about them. You probably don't know anything about them! So instead of assuming you know everything, why not ask them about their story?𝟐. 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞.Comparison is the thief of joy, as they say. Constantly comparing yourself to others will only make you feel worse about yourself. And comparing others to each other is just as bad! Everyone is unique and special in their way, so there's no need to compare.𝟑. 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐞𝐥.Labeling someone as "good or bad" is unfair and doesn't give them a chance to redeem themselves. And once you label someone, it's hard to see them any other way. So instead of labeling, why not give everyone the benefit of the doubt?𝟒. 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐣𝐮𝐝𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥.This one is self-explanatory. If you don't want to be judged, don't judge others! It's that simple.𝟓. 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲.Just because someone says or does something doesn't mean it's personal. Sometimes people say and do things without thinking, which has nothing to do with you. So instead of taking things personally, try to see the situation from their perspective.Judging self and others is a quick process, but it's not always accurate. So next time you're tempted to judge someone, remember these five simple steps, and give them (and yourself!) a chance! for more visit :https://bit.ly/3sFOEoR #anxiety #depression #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #love #mentalhealthmatters #stress #selflove #ptsd #mentalillness #therapy #healing #health #wellness #mindfulness #anxietyrelief #motivation #recovery #trauma #life #psychology #sad #bipolar #meditation #anxietyawareness #quotes #covid #pain #loveyourself

Changing of the seasons…….It is getting to that time of year when the nights are longer, the days are shorter and the weather is colder and wetter. It’s amazing how the changing of the seasons can affect our mood and just our general feelings of well-being.When the weather is good and the days are longer it is easy to spend time outdoors and make the most of the weather, whether its sitting at home in the garden, going for a walk or even sitting outside having a meal with friends.However, when the clocks go back it is so much harder and many people (myself included) can find it only too easy to make excuses not to leave the sofa. The problem with that is, that your world can become very small and consist of only leaving the house to go to work and sitting on front of the TV. In fact with hybrid working being so prevalent these days, you are probably getting less interaction with people than ever before and even for an introvert like me I know that’s not healthy, as humans are sociable creatures.The other problem with not going anywhere and just staring at the TV is that if you are struggling with anything, whether it is anxiety, depression, stress, grief, low self-esteem etc it makes it worse if you overthink it.So, I guess my message is even though you may not feel like it, try and make that effort to get out of the house occasionally. Accept that invitation to go and meet some friends or even put your wellies on and go and splash in some puddles like you did when you were a child. Remember there is a big world out there – make the most of it.#sad #autumn #rain #winter #anxiety #depression #sociable #lowmood #anxiety

Daylight saving time changes moods. The changing seasons may affect the way you think and the way you function. Adjusting to the situation may require that you wake an hour earlier to keep your internal clock steady. It takes discipline; but the results will help you avoid suffering from symptoms of SAD or Seasonal Affective Disorder. #time #sad #seasons #seasonal #timechange

It’s dark when you get up in the morning and dark when you’re eating dinner. During the shorter days of late fall and winter, it’s not uncommon to feel a little down. You may just have a mild case of depression that you can get through on your own. But if you’re struggling to cope, it could be seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depression that affects between four and six percent of the population.Thank you to Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health for this article: https://lnkd.in/eT4mNRtq #SAD #MentalHealth #PrincetonHousebh

Many people feel guilty for all sorts of reasons, ranging from minor infractions to major life choices. The good news is that there are things you can do to free yourself from this debilitating emotion.Here are five ways to free yourself from guilt:𝟏. 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬The first step is to become aware of your feelings. Feelings such as sadness, anger, or regret, often accompany guilty. Once you identify the guilt, you can start working through the other's emotions.𝟐. 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟Forgiving yourself is an essential part of moving on from guilt. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and that you're not a bad person just because you made one. If you can't forgive yourself, try talking to a coach who can help you see your situation in a new light. 𝟑. 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐤If you're constantly berating yourself for your mistakes, it's time to change your self-talk. Instead of beating yourself up, try to be understanding and compassionate with yourself. Remind yourself that you're human and that everyone makes mistakes.𝟒. 𝐒𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲Feeling guilty makes it easy to get lost in your emotions and completely wrapped up in your perspective. However, it's essential to try to seek objectivity. Talk to a trusted friend or family member or ask your coach to help you to get a different perspective on the situation.𝟓. 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧If your guilt is due to something you did, it's crucial to take action to make things right, like apologizing, making amends, or changing your behavior in the future. Acting can help you feel better and start moving on.Guilt can be a complex emotion to deal with, but it is possible to free yourself from it. By taking the time to identify the source of it, you can start to overcome the hurdles you have enabled. ....for more visit :https://bit.ly/3sFOEoR #anxiety #depression #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #love #mentalhealthmatters #stress #selflove #ptsd #mentalillness #therapy #healing #health #wellness #mindfulness #anxietyrelief #motivation #recovery #trauma #life #psychology #sad #bipolar #meditation #anxietyawareness #quotes #covid #pain #loveyourself

As a parent, do you always try to look for the positives with your kids? WARNING: doing this teaches kids to abandon themselves. One thing that helped me is realising when we are trying to be upbeat, happy and positive - we are abandoning ourselves.  We are bypassing the reality and being fake.  When we do this to others we are being conditionally loving - saying “I only love you when you’re happy and upbeat!”  This causes a breakdown and burnout in families and work.  What’s needed is empathy, and a space for authenticity.  Where mistakes are moments to learn skills and feelings are a blessing to weave love.  In that deep acceptance people can use the shitty experience as fertiliser. When the shit is sugar coated, it may look good, but it still stinks.  So the more we can hold space for our kids, empathise, coregulate, listen and understand what skills they’re struggling with, the more we can support them.  When meeting them where they are at, rather than imposing who we wish they’d be - they begin to love themselves. If you struggle with holding space and responding - let me know.  I have a training that takes you through the struggles and how to care for yourself while you respond to your kid.#restoringlove #bypassing #parenting #positivevibes #teen #children #parents #adhd #autism #autistic #neurodivergent #empathy #feelings #angry #sad #love #selfcare #selflove #healing #trauma #traumarecovery #traumahealing

𝟓 𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐦 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭If you're like most people, you're probably your own worst critic. You beat yourself up for every little mistake. While it's good to be self-critical to a certain extent, it's essential to know when to draw the line. Otherwise, you'll end up feeling bad about yourself all the time.Here are five ways to convert your self-criticism into self-acknowledgment:𝟏. 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐕𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞The first step is to become aware of your inner voice. Pay attention to the things you say to yourself daily. Are they mostly negative? If so, it's time to start monitoring your inner voice and try to silence (or at least stop listening to) your inner critic.𝟮. 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀One of the main reasons why we're so hard on ourselves is because we set unrealistic expectations. We expect to be perfect always, and when we're not, we feel like we've failed.Instead of setting unrealistic expectations, try to be more realistic. Accept that you're not going to be perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. When you make a mistake, acknowledge it and learn from it.𝟑. 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬Inspired by the famous Mr. Rogers quote: "When I was a boy, and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers." You will always find people who are helping.'Whenever you're feeling down about yourself, try to find "the helpers." Look for the positive things in your life and the people who are always there for you. Focusing on the positive will help you see the good in yourself.𝟒. 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬One of the best ways to silence your inner critic is to accept compliments. Don't brush it off or downplay it whenever someone pays you a compliment. Just say "thank you" and believe the person is telling the truth.𝟓. 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧Finally, try to be more compassionate with yourself. If you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up. Instead, try to understand why you made a mistake and how you can avoid making it in the future.If you can start following these tips, you'll slowly but surely begin to silence your inner critic. You'll start to feel better about yourself, and you'll be able to focus on and enjoy the positive things in your life. ...for more visit :https://bit.ly/3sFOEoR #anxiety #depression #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #love #mentalhealthmatters #stress #selflove #ptsd #mentalillness #therapy #healing #health #wellness #mindfulness #anxietyrelief #motivation #recovery #trauma #life #psychology #sad #bipolar #meditation #anxietyawareness #quotes #covid #pain #loveyourself

As anxiety is a response to a perceived threat, our bodies naturally get into a posture that enhances our protection. Hunching over protects essential organs such as the heart and lungs, which are essential for survival. So whenever you are anxious, improve your posture.Stand up tall or sit upright with your shoulders back and open your chest.In this posture, breathe deeply.Your body will realize that it is not under any threat, and this will help reduce anxiety.

SEALS--as most special operations / Tier One & Two units --are called to risk their lives, in the most inhospitable conditions.  The training has to be "brutal", to be able to endure a real combat scenario.  There is no weakness allowed when in such an environment (combat)......

Message from user_anon: ur so ugly lolI can barely read the message - my eyes are burning with the weight of unshed tears, and my hands are trembling, threatening to drop my phone. A flame has reignited under my skin, and it feels like my face is fracturing.Message from anonnn_ymous: I know where you live.Fear has found a home in my heart, and it sends waves throughout my body, rippling my face. I no longer feel like myself - I am a shadow of the person I was, broken down.Message from dont_know_me: send me pictures of yourself or else...Shame rings in my ears. Tears of blood streak down my face, which the cruel words have caused to morph and twist until I look like a reflection of the pained monsters who sent me the messages.Why have they done this to me? Does it make them feel better, sitting hidden behind their screens, weaponising words and tearing me down? I wish I could plead with them to leave me alone - but I don't; I won't.Instead, I click on the block button, and I encourage myself to continue doing what I want. I vow to spread joy and happiness, even more, to erase the effects of the negativity they put into the world. For as much as they want me to feel ugly, I know the ugliness does not reside in me - it resides in them.[Artwork by Tia; caption by Shivali]~ #digital #instagram #socialmedia #twitter #worldwideweb #bullying #cyberbullying #harassment #cyberharassment #anonymous #bully #youtube #cybersafety #phone #internet  #privacy #messages #hatemessages #positivity #negativity #story #online #sad #hate #like #happiness #linkedin #teenagers #teenage #highschool #students #college #morning

Thanks for the timely reminder, Arianna! Funny because it's so true.As we face increasing uncertainty in the #jobsearch marketplace, maintaining our mental, physical, and emotional balance is going to be even more important. #burnout culture is not making you or your #workplace more #productive. It leads to reactive, impulsive, short-term decisions that will backfire and only lose your company money and hours and hours of #productivity, #innovation, and goodwill.I feel bad for everyone at #twitter right now, where burnout culture has just become the company mission statement. #sad.

What exercise should we do to write an excellent Essay for UPSC?  Essay For UPSC Writing course offered by Eden IAS. It is mentored by Mr. Tirthankar Roychowdhary, who is the best teacher for essay and Ethics so far. There, I learned that in order to write a great essay, one has to do rigorous brainstorming. Brainstorming refers to the collection of all the ideas, concepts, and evidence at one point for a quick response. This makes the skeleton of the essay or the framework of the essay. Those who don't do good brainstorming, won't be able to write a good essay. So, I think one should exercise brainstorming often in order to write excellent essays. For more Information Visit Our Site:  https://lnkd.in/dMGU5bWg#sad #mood #hurt #future #futuretension #carior #life #instagood #reelkarofeelkaro #upsc #ias #ips #motivation #syllabus #upscsyllabus #exam #upscexam #prelims #upscpre #upscwala #uw #uwmotivation #upscwalamotivation

To continue our S.A.D (Seasonal Affective Disorder) series, we're suggesting going on a walk! Getting outside in any capacity has many benefits for our brains, bodies, and overall wellbeing by producing endorphins, lowering blood pressure, exercising muscles and moving joints. Whether you walk through a park, city, neighborhood, or anywhere, a change of scenery from our office or house can really help clear our minds and help us destress.Does anyone have a routine place they love to walk?#TakeAWalk #getoutside #sunlight #SAD #SeasonAffectiveDisorder #wellbeing #healthbenefits #HoustonCounseling #JEM #Wellness #SADSeries

As anxiety is a response to a perceived threat, our bodies naturally get into a posture that enhances our protection. Hunching over protects essential organs such as the heart and lungs, which are essential for survival.So whenever you are anxious, improve your posture.Stand up tall or sit upright with your shoulders back and open your chest.In this posture, breathe deeply.Your body will realize that it is not under any threat, and this will help reduce anxiety.Contact Us Today for your health care, mental health, and business entrepreneurship Needs✆ (310) 612-7022@ Alina@360mindsetcoach.com#emotional #offensive #emotions #sad #stress #mentalhealthrecovery #anxiety #mentalhealthmatters #stressed #socialanxiety #depressing #mentalhealth #depression#successcoach #careercoaching #careercoach
