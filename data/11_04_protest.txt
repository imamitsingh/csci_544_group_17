The fact that the white supremacist nations of the world feign authority over all is a real problem, in my opinion. As an American I can state unequivocally that we have no right to police the world when our priorities are so entirely out of line. The same goes for the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and so on.No child deserves this...

Together, we’re ending the use of near-drowning tests and saving animals from being forced to swim for their lives. And we won’t stop until these abusive and pointless experiments are a thing of the past.Some companies and universities completely stopped using—and/or supporting others that use—the near-drowning test following actions taken by PETA and our supporters, including outreach by our scientists, protests, PETA-proposed shareholder resolutions, and e-mails and calls from our supporters. Let’s get more companies to ban the near-drowning test on animals. Use PETA’s quick form to contact Eli Lilly today.https://lnkd.in/g8NAKfpG#experiments #experiment #experimentation #science #scienceandtechnology #scientist #company #companies #university #universities #highereducation #protest #demo #demonstration #shareholder #shareholders #shares #email #call #animal #animals #animalrights #animalwelfare #animalcare #crueltyfree #saveanimals #vegan #govegan #plantbased #nonprofit #nonprofitorganization #advocate #advocacy #activist #activism #victory #politicsandlaw #socialissues

While I couldn’t be there myself, I was there in spirit cheering on the Pregnant Then Screwed and the #marchofthemummies over the past week as the over 15,000 parents and supporters took to the streets in London, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast, Cardiff, Exeter, Norwich, Bristol, Newcastle and Birmingham. The coverage has looked spectacular, truly raising awareness around the penalty of motherhood in the UK. Well done to Joeli Brearley and her incredibly talented team. Despite the UK being in desperate need of more people returning to work, many mothers are prevented from returning to their careers by increasingly high childcare costs. It’s contributing to the gender pay gap – which increased in 2021and looks as if it could do so again (but that’s a post for another day!) – and preventing women from making the most of their talents in the workplace.Without adequate funding from the government, nurseries are forced to pass costs on to parents who increasingly cannot afford them. New research shows that parents with the lowest incomes are having to spend three times as much on childcare as the richest. The poorest parents spend 17% of their household earnings on childcare, compared to 5% for the wealthiest.How utterly heartbreaking. Low wages are making childcare an unattractive career option for nursery staff and childminders, who are in seriously short supply, while energy costs are heaping more pressure on nurseries to charge astronomical fees.This is why keeping the conversation going is vital. The risk of burnout to those nursery staff and childminders is real. The parents who have to take unpaid leave to be able to take care of their children are being put at an even greater disadvantage. it’s preventing mothers from getting back to work or progressing in their careers and widening the childcare poverty gap.Get involved and follow Pregnant Then Screwed and find out about what they’re doing on their website at the link in the comments.#parentsatwork #childcare #womenatwork #workingmum #workingparents #economy #society #workingparents #workingdads  #maternitypay #paternitypay #protest #change

If you criticise Putin's Russia for how protestors are treated yet haven't heard about this, it gives you an idea of what our media in the UK prioritises. The House of Lords rejected the last form of this bill, but they're trying to pass it in a slightly different form...Suella Braverman's new Public Order Bill would mean:● Anyone who has taken part in protest that caused “serious disruption to two or more individuals or to an organisation” in the previous five years, or encouraged other people to take part, could be forced to wear an electronic tag to monitor their movements.● People suspected of planning protest could also be forced to “remain at a particular place for particular periods” and prohibited from associating “with particular persons”, entering “particular areas” or using the internet to encourage others to protest. Anyone breaking these terms could face up to 51 weeks in prison.● “Locking on” – the method of non-violent protest used by the Suffragettes and many others – would become a criminal offence.● A new offence of “interfering with key national infrastructure” could be used to criminalise protesters at almost any site of power, or who disrupt transport."Sign the petition against it here: https://lnkd.in/ezZfw246 and write to your MP (here's a template letter you can use: https://lnkd.in/ee-aZFHc ) #protest #righttoprotest #publicorderbill #ukpolitics #freedom #democracy #humanrights #climatechange

My piece just out in The Conversation on the Public Order Bill. Written before fracking is now seemingly off the menu again, but it's hard to keep up with the government's U-turns at the moment (welcome as that one is).It's meant to be as much a (hopefully) thought-provoking role-reversal piece as it is a definitive piece of legal advice, and is probably best read in that context.https://lnkd.in/eRXfeB-t#protest #juststopoil #extinctionrebellion #insulatebritain #criminallaw #climateaction

Global energy demand to grow 47% by 2050, with oil still top source! (According to S&P Global)You may question the relation of above topic with below picture! Let me elaborate. It is more than 45 days that brave Iranian boys & girls are fighting for basic human rights with bare hands. This fight may continue for many more days, months or even years as long as Oil rules as the dominant source of energy. Iran's oil & gas reserves estimated at 1.2 trillion barrels in 2022 by NIOC chief. As long as this natural resource is there, the global power will not let the democracy to be established in the country or the entire region to rest. Unfortunately, what you hear from the media is very different from the true actions of Global Powers. #energy #media #democracy #protest #humanrights

Anyone in London tomorrow is welcome to join the #marchofthemummies which I am proud to be stewarding along with Matt Dalton. If you are elsewhere in the UK then there is a march near you. Why I am doing this:- Because Pregnant Then Screwed supported me for 2 years by giving me a free Employment Tribunal mentor when I was made redundant from EY after a horrendous #miscarriage - because childcare in the UK is the second most expensive in the world, crippling families and starting the #genderpaygap - this pay gap affects our whole economy, GDP and productivity as a nation. This is not just about women...- although women are the ones being made redundant (54 000 a year in the UK in and around birth) and face a pay penalty of 45% lower earnings in the 6 years after birth This isn't just about women. This affects the structure of our society, our economy and the health, mental health and wellbeing of us all. Men and children are impacted by the costs, lack of flex and the mental health challenges this brings. And if I haven't convinced you enough here are 2 more reasons:1. #rishisunak was found by the Court of Appeal to have indirectly discriminated against new mothers in his Covid support. See comments for story but the fact this needed to be tested in court and appealed says it all. The current government is problematic for rights in this area.2. Our right to protest is being ebbed away by the new Public Order Bill which is going through the House of Lords. This is a democratic right we need to make sure remains. Info on this and the fact that the Metropolitan Police tried to ban this march in comments below.So if you have nothing to do tomorrow and fancy a walk (as well as exercising your legal right to protest while you still have it) I will see you at Trafalgar Square at 10am. This matters... Joeli Brearley Danielle Ayres Natalie Sutherland Rishi Sunak Dr Baroness Helen Newlove LLD (hc) DCL Analiese Doctrove#womensrights #childcare #protest https://lnkd.in/eJEiwSiC

Every year less and less people come to my community centre to burst crackers. The number isn't #zero  yet, but it's getting there.So I #urge all of you to if not this do something in your own #community to take up the cause of #Climateaction and have a truly meaningful #diwali22

On the other hand, the Iranian hacktivist group Black Reward claimed responsibility for the attack even before the announcement. They threatened to release documents on Tehran’s #nuclear program unless all “political prisoners, prisoners of conscience, and people arrested in the recent protests” were released within 24 hours. The Iranian government remained silent about the threat, but when the time expired, the #hacktivist group began to publish the leaked data in pieces on the Anonymous File Upload site.To read more 👇https://lnkd.in/ebrMUU7f #dataleak #iran #protest #mahsaamini #hacktivism

I'm doing my bit, so why do you stop me?". The protester replied stating the government needs to halt all new oil and gas licenses, to which the taxi driver replied "You can't do this, and it doesn't just happen overnight., does it?" ⛽What is your opinion?

Russian State Duma deputy Vyacheslav Markhaev will participate in anti-war protests on November 4Former senator from #Buryatia and State Duma #deputy from the Communist Party Vyacheslav Markhaev said that he would personally attend the #protest #against the #war on November 4, the Strela Telegram channel writes.Earlier, the same Telegram channel published information about mass anti-war protests planned for November 4 in Buryatia, without naming the source. A similar message appeared in Protest Russia.Vyacheslav Markhaev did not vote for joining Zaporozhye and Kherson regions of Ukraine to Russia, but voted for joining the "LNR" and "DNR". Even at the beginning of the so-called special operation, Markhaev openly criticized it.Vyacheslav Markhaev is the leader of the protest voting among the deputies of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation in the State Duma, he votes against certain bills more often than others.*****🥸 When it comes to the #personal #interests of #Russians - such as #mobilization or #famine - they begin to suspect somethingBut imperialism in them is innate #Russia #Senator #Buryatia

A few years ago, I cut off What's App, installed Signal and Telegram and never looked back... until now.When the Meta companies decided to change their terms of #business and privacy policies, I was outraged.Facebook started stifling debate in favour of (IMHO) other corrupt organisations, so I stepped away from that too.- I moved from Uber to Bolt. - I started to use cash again. - I shopped more at local shops.- I got more involved with protests and local community initiatives.U-turns were reported, but the damage had been done. I lost trust in many global brands. In a topsy-turvy, higgledy-piggledy, back-to-front World in which big corporations manipulate emotions to gain profit - these decisions gave me clarity and focus. Each a small #protest. One person. I know.I didn't really notice any difference until I started connecting with people that I had previously communicated with on these platforms.In revisiting the issue, I come back to the question: "Can I bend on this principle for the sake of comfort and convenience?""Has this company shown that they have learned a lesson?"I'll never say never, but for today the answer for both are "no, not yet".

Iranian police opened fire on protesters in the south-eastern city of Zahedan in the region of Baluchistan. There were reports of as many as six killed in Zahedan on Friday, including a 12-year-old boy. Footage obtained by Reuters showed large crowds marching through the city's streets chanting anti-government slogans after they had come out of Friday prayer. Further footage circulating widely on social media showed protesters fleeing as security forces repeatedly fired.  #police #security #socialmedia #iran #iranian #protest

Why should you pause and reflect on the climate art protests?Even as someone deeply passionate about climate action, I scoffed and squirmed at these protests—until today, when I actually watched the videos and heard what they had to say.“What is worth more, art or life?”Our planet is dying. Climate change is contributing to extreme weather events, an alarming sea-level rise, and significant disruptions to biodiversity. What's the point in preserving art and culture, if our species won't survive to experience it?I'm not saying that this type of protest is exactly my cup of soup—even less so if the paintings weren't protected by glass—but I believe in the importance of taking a stand.At the end of my life, I want to know that I did my best to help the planet, in a way that was authentic to me.What are your thoughts?#climatechange #climateaction #climatecrisis #climate #protest

Whilst I’m ‘released under investigation’ for protesting at the Queen’s jubilee, our government’s policy has been found unlawful..The question is, who are the real criminals?Lack of transparency and dangerous narratives from Essex police like “We will take action against anyone who puts life in danger (except the government) or thinks they can selfishly stop others.. getting on with their lives”If we just keep calm and carry on with business as usual this is surely the most dangerous thing we can do? Is apathy and densensitisation what’s needed right now?Let’s be honest, the government would not have even declared a climate emergency or announced a net zero policy in 2019 if XR hadn’t taken to the streets with such efficacy.#justice #law #climatecrisis #protest

Another excellent write up in the New York Post about yesterday’s protest at the White House. The opening paragraph tells you a lot about the overwhelming support to hold this administration accountable. “WASHINGTON — Marijuana activists protested at the White House Monday against President Biden’s “disgusting” and “self-serving” move to pardon about 6,500 people convicted federally of simple pot possession while leaving all of the roughly 2,700 federal pot inmates behind bars.Protesters blasted on loop audio of Biden’s 2019 campaign pledge to free “everyone” in prison for pot and accused him of a half-measure designed to mislead voters ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections.”https://lnkd.in/g-84SRsCStudents for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) Last Prisoner Project Dr. Bronner's #nypostnyc #nypost #newyorkpost #joebiden #potus #pot #disgusting #selfserving #stunt #emptypromises #protest #rally #demonstration #prisoners #incarceration #prohibition #legalization #demand #justice

Today's #Ener-tea 🍵 : Just Stop Oil's Climate Protest using Tomato Soup 🥫You may have seen the viral story of activists from Just Stop Oil throwing tomato soup on a Van Gogh painting. It sparked a lot of hot takes on whether the protest started a conversation or it's negatively impacting the climate movement.But are these opinions based on research or evidence? 🤔There are many researchers studying the history and effectiveness of social movements and different direct action tactics. So even though direct action can definitely be risky, let's not forget that there's history and research we can draw on to put things into context.Finally, we want to point out that a lot of direct action on climate change goes unnoticed - people putting their bodies and livelihoods on the line daily to protect forests, waterways, and our planet. Whether you are intrigued or annoyed by SoupGate, we invite you to use this as a starting point to learn about the different kinds of direct action happening in your community.#StudentEnergy #Enertea #Energy101 #JustStopOil #TomatoSoup #Protest #IndividualAction #CollectiveAction #CleanEnergy #CleanEnergyTransition #SayNoToFossil #FossilFuels #Renewables #RenewableEnergy #SolarPower #WindPower #EnergyProduction #ClimateChange #ClimateGoals #ClimateTargets #CarbonReduction #CarbonEmissions #Environment

Important Update about Brazil from our agent Grifo MarineWe need to communicate about actual BRAZIL situation in view of current protests against election of Luiz Inacio Lula occurred last Sunday. Since last Monday afternoon, protests in main Brazilian roads started by causing blockage and affecting transport of people and goods and congestion in airports. Please note below some press news about current situation: https://lnkd.in/d9vPYG6R https://lnkd.in/d87MB3vK https://lnkd.in/dw-HYGk3 We are constantly monitoring this situation since beginning and from today we could start to see an improvement by ceasing or spreading the protests in some roads. Yesterday 31/10 was the most problematic day whence we have some constraints for crew transportation from Airport to Port via roads for longer distances. For instance, transportation from Porto Alegre to Rio Grande was affected by needing to host crew at Porto Alegre to wait for next day. Today 01/11 we could see a better improvement for cars in main Brazilian roads after intervention from Military Police. However there are some locations at Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo that roads are still blocked causing delays and congestion in those areas. For the moment we don’t face any constraint for crew change and other related husbandry services.  Tomorrow 02/11 is holiday and its expected a huge movement of protests across the Country. Anyhow we expect for next day 03/11 that situation improves and things return to back to normal. We will keep close monitoring and revert with updated information about this situation.#Brazil #Protest #Shipping #GrifoMarine #DynaRep

They produced video showing Amini collapsing in a police station to support their claim, but the video and pictures of her in a coma enraged ordinary Iranians.Since then, the protests have escalated, and security forces responded by repeatedly using unlawful force. They have used water cannons and tear gas improperly, shot metal pellets and live ammunition at protestors from close range and severely beat others with batons. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, has said at least 201 people, including 23 children, have been killed by security forces. At least two people have lost vision in one or both eyes, and hundreds more have suffered excruciatingly painful injuries. For fear of being arrested, the majority avoid going to the hospital, which raises the danger of infection and other health issues. Iranian authorities are now shutting down the Internet to hide their crimes. #ALSACambodia #AlwaysBeOne #Iranian #Protest #Woman #Death

Imran Khan blames politicians and general for attack at rally.Former Pakistan premier #ImranKhan underwent surgery to remove #bullet fragments after he was #shot in the leg at a rally in eastern Punjab province. He is in stable condition.Other #PTI officials have said there were two shooters at the scene. Local TV stations are broadcasting the alleged confession made by one of the attackers to the police. At least one by-stander was killed in the gunfire, according to police. Sharif’s government has condemned the incident and called for an investigation.  The former premier was leading a #LongMarch  toward the capital Islamabad to demand early elections.  Several supporters have taken to the streets in Karachi and Islamabad and other cities to #protest and Khan’s party leaders are urging for the march to continue.

Maybe it’s a developed country thing. Maybe this is what happens when we mix Social media with protests. The optics and message don’t resonate. Does it for you?In the 2000s, I remember greenpeace having their own ship trying to block oil tankers or freeing chickens/animals from testing facilities or industrialized farms. You saw a protest in a form of an action against the regime they opposed.Throwing mashed potatoes on a painting to protest against fossil fuel and climate change. The #branding or #marketing doesn’t relate to myself as a  consumer or reader.Climate change and fossil fuel concerns are real. There must be a better way to protest so the branding and marketing hits.Protesting an OPEC+ conference, hacking big oil website, or painting graffiti on a refinery? Or maybe, pushing the government to provide subsidies for renewable energy vehicles and batteries at the house?https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/police-arrest-climate-protestors-who-threw-mashed-potatoes-at-monet-painting.html #socialmedia #purpose #protest #climatechange

What are Scope 3 emissions? These are the indirect emissions that take place in a company's value chain, from raw materials to users of downstream products. US steelmakers will need to shift their attention to such emissions to keep up with standards set to reduce greenhouse gasses. This will be significantly more challenging for the market since many of these emissions are beyond what a steelmaker has direct control over. Is your business up for the task? Check out our new steelmakers' guide to tackling upstream Scope 3 emissions.

Life with Normal 40 – Confusing Vanity Plates and Half-Staff FlagsIn Normal Land, the list of mysteries grows by the day. Why does Daughter B only attack me with “the speech” about buying her a cell phone when I’m at the end of my day and near comatose? Or why have I not slimmed down in preparation for the coming holiday season when I will inevitably consume my body weight in Christmas cookies? We may never know.But far more perplexing and urgent conundrums must be addressed: incoherent vanity plates and flags flown at half-staff for no apparent reason.License/number plates such as “MYPORSCHE” are complete hosebaggery but at least they helpfully signal the rest of us to dodge you at company Christmas parties. Likewise, “20DOGS” informs fellow humans that you either operate a rescue kennel (commendable) or your house reeks of unkempt poodles (avoidable). But for too long, countless drivers have struggled to decipher the meaning behind such plates as “LVWR.”Are you a twisted lover of all things war? Do you play wide receiver for the Las Vegas Raiders? Is LVWR a public radio station that we’ve never heard of but to which we should happily donate? You won’t say!Meanwhile, flags worldwide continue to be slightly lowered at will and without sufficient backstory. Which unprovoked conflict, recently-deceased politician, natural disaster or unknown ailment that needs more research should we be upset about? Indecipherable flag-flyers refuse to answer.But this unnecessary lack of clarity cannot stand!If you must display a specialized message on your chosen means of transport or if you cannot help but lift a rope-strung cloth halfway to the sky, you must observe the following rules for the good of the planet.Any mysterious vanity plate should be accompanied by a prominently displayed placard or bumper sticker which reveals the related number of children, career, hobbies and/or bucket list destinations. Be sure to use lettering legible from at least six car lengths away and avoid scripted fonts entirely. Failure to operate a vehicle within these guardrails of sanity will result in permanently banning you from aluminum-emblazoned messages of all types.In parallel, I realize that flying flags at half-staff is an ancient and often heartfelt ritual to express mourning, solidarity or compassion. But slightly airborne fabric flown in times other than global conflict should legally require further explanation.A small informational stand, preferably weatherproof, will cue the attentive among us to express sympathy or fury and perhaps compel us to decrease the height of our own flags. Leaving others in the dark is just a waste of cotton.Join my fight for transparency. Or suffer the wrath of the confused masses.#driving #protest #confused #flags #funny #lifewithnormal

I am ready for my second citizenship I have so many things to say, so many experiences to showcase, so many stories to tell, but most importantly I'm grateful.I'm grateful for the opportunity to have carried the green card.I’m grateful to have been called a citizen of Nigeria, who lived in such an innovative street smart and underprivileged community whose goal has always been to impact its community positively.I'm grateful to have been one of the first citizens who decided to acquire his passport immediately after the #endsar #protest even thou I was told that the struggle of our heroes will never be in #vainI'm grateful for the lessons learnt, of which I count my top three:1. That I can do anything I put my mind to.2. That it wouldn't be perfect at first but keep pushing.3. That only those prepared are liable to see opportunities. I am grateful for the patience and the opportunity to experience growth as a global citizen from a third world country.I'm grateful that the shameful and despicable state of this country due to bad leadership has made me an inspiring young man tremendously makes effort in making it work while putting forward his best foot globally even when sometimes they didn't fit.I have many mixed emotions even as I officially intend to get my second citizenship by investment in other to start a new beginning for my bloodline.Nevertheless, it's been an honour  been only a Nigerian. I celebrate you all. This was my speech delivered on Thursday 20th October, 2022A day set aside for #endsar,  the remembrance of the departed souls during the youthful struggle in raising their voice against one of the most powerful Nigerian  governments agency called SARS.

Even with the pains l feel right now, I couldn't help knowing that people lost their lives but l am alive today and that makes me gratefulOn this day years ago, a lot of Nigerian youths lost their lives during a peaceful protest at the #lekkilagosnigeria in the bid to be heard for having a better #nigeriaWe all know where it pains us the most and as such we try to give our voices seeking for good governance As we all know, our country is already in a mess and it will take oneness and unity in voice and action to achieve the building of the kind of country we desire to live inOur leaders do not care eventho they are aware that our sons and daughters roam the streets of Nigeria trying to make ends meet whereas we have lot of treasure that if properly utilised, people will be taken off the street Our leaders have chosen to play a game of chess and ludo on our destiny for selfish reasons since they are not directly affected2023 is around the corner and so many are aspiring for the seat of leadership The question is???Is there any of them that will forgo their selfish desire and greed, and take into consideration the cry of many #mothers #fathers #youths and even #children and do right by usToday the youths and many others are crying and seeking to be heard for good governance to emerge But I'll like to ask?How many of these youths will stay true to their conscience and hold their dignity high when a #500 note or at most #1000 note flips through them on election dayOn the election day, will you hold yourself knowing that the #1000 being given to you won't feed you for the next 4 years or you'll go the polling unit with your #pvc and cast your vote following your conscience and ensuring the right leader emergesI want you to know that it's not enough to scream at the toll gate and loss lives in the process yet at the end, you still do not do right by youThink about it!Think about what would happen if you choose #1000 over your conscienceThink about what would happen if we still don't get it right this timeThe future lies in the decision we make today. Don't let them use you to rig the electionWhen they use You, they use your destiny as well #bewise don't just scream cos it's not enough You have the right to decide #chosewiselyAnd be the #change you want to seeMay the souls of the ones departed on this day continue to #ripI remain #yourfavouritemechanic #protest#onenigeria#leadership #future

After a tense and tight race, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will return to the presidency on January 1, after receiving more than 60 million votes and defeating current President Jair Bolsonaro. This will be Lula’s third term, after serving two consecutive terms from 2003 to 2010.Having spent 580 day in prison for corruption charges beginning in April 2018 —thus being barred from the 2018 presidential election— in his victory on Sunday, the founder and honorary president of Brazil’s Workers’ Party spoke of his “resurrection.”This is the first time in the nearly 40 years since the return of democracy in Brazil that a president wasn’t able to win reelection.At the time of this reporting, Bolsonaro had yet to concede defeat. Thousands of his supporters, in different parts of the country, had blocked roads demanding that the armed forces stage a coup.Mine for Latino Rebels. #Politics #Brazil #Bolsonaro #Lula #leection #Violence #ForeignPolicy #HumanRights #Coup #Demcoracy #Protest #Conflict

Bloodied bandages wrapped around my head, I emerge from the darkened central London underground station into the bright, cloudy day. The rough gentle scratch of wood against my palm, friction as I walk towards the crowd, to join the March of the Mummies!This Saturday we march all over the UK to say enough is enough. March of the Mummies is organised by Pregnant Then Screwed and the inimitable Joeli Brearley. 'Childcare providers are falling like dominos, mothers are dropping out of the workforce in droves, the gender pay gap seems to be increasing and more families are now living in poverty.'I'm a big believer in the power of a diverse and representative team collaborating to produce magical creativity that connects with real people. How the hell are we going to keep doing that if we lose so many women from work because our childcare and parental leave system is broken? Until parents (of all genitalia) can spend time with their kids without running out of food, and then have someone nice that they can afford to look after the kids when they go back to work, we're all screwed. But especially women.Link in the comments to find out about your local march. Let's get f**king angry! #marchofthemummies #pregnantthenscrewed #protest

Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old girl. She was a young Kurdish woman whose name or personal story we would have never known unless one day last September her hijab had not slipped a few centimetres back, exposing part of her hair.She was traveling with her family to Tehran when the “moral security agency”, the moral police, arrested her. She died some days later, after having been in the hospital for the injuries received.The authorities, in their defence and ignoring any responsibility, alleged that Mahsa suffered from previous illnesses such as epilepsy, diabetes or a head tumour that was operated on during her childhood. Information that his parents deny.The reality is that Mahsa was healthy. Mahsa was arrested for not having her hair completely covered. Mahsa died on September 16th, 2022, from what were clearly the consequences of a brutal beating.Thousands of women have protested since then. From small demonstrations, probably somehow frivolous, like haircuts, to women throwing their hijabs in the air at the risk of suffering the same consequences as Mahsa. Leaders and leaders from all over the world have spoken up about it, although the situation was far from surprising new.A few days ago, without going any further, the Iranian athlete who took part in a climbing competition without a hijab has been in the news. Elnaz Rekabi joined her country's protests over the death of Masha Amini, she was greeted with applause at the Tehran airport. I write these lines without knowing if in a few hours or days I will have to change this paragraph and add the horrible news of a tragedy in response from the authorities to this act of absolute bravery.From the corners of the world, in which women have already achieved quotas of equality and rights that were denied to us for years, we cannot stop reviving that the world still needs a great, radical, transformation so that 50% of its inhabitants are recognized, respected and not persecuted, attacked, repressed or assaulted for the simple fact of being female.I doubt that Mahsa was a feminist, she had not been in any protests, she probably lived oblivious to the struggle that would have been necessary to change her destiny. Because only feminism will save us from this barbarism in which a woman can die, can be attacked simply because a rebellious lock of hair is visible.Feminism is, has been and will be the only possible engine for equality.Feminism is the way, but it takes a lot of work, awareness, legislation and zero permissiveness to reach the goal.Written by Irene Jezabel Sánchez MasegosaTranslated by NOELIA RIBO  https://lnkd.in/ermZG97y#feminist #protest #empoweringwomen #forwomen #MahsaAmini #WomanLifeFreedom #iranprotests #iranwomen #stoptheocraticfascism #MahsaAmini #asrapanahi #woman_life_freedom #humanrights #womensrights #iranrevolution #womenrights #respectforall#equality #genderequality #girlpower #womenpower #justice #freedom #sdg5 #sdgs

This is my Dad. My Dad is 76 years old, and came to Australia in 1968 and up until Covid-19 worked pretty much 7 days a week in his taxi that he was a proud owner of. He worked hard to pay off our family home, pay off his taxi which was his planned superannuation. His plan was to lease out the cab or sell it and live off this income. He was very secure and proud of what he achieved. Up until the Government allowed Uber into the industry with absolutely no compensation to plate owners. It’s absolutely disgusting that a man of his age and a taxpayer for all these years has been reduced to this. The value of his cab has dropped more than 80% due to Uber and he leases the plate back to Legion Cabs for a sum that is an insult. He attended his first ever protest yesterday. I’m so proud of you Dad. And you are right - the Government’s mistake should not be tax payer funded, they need to right their wrong.#taxis #legioncabs #prouddaughter #nswtaxis #nswgovernment #protest

“Women, Life, Freedom” is the goal here.Iran’s women are making bold strides for their freedom. The strict rules on women’s dress, followed by mistreatment from men and the morality police, are no longer tolerable. Women are using their voices to fight back against the harsh regulations they face, even when they know the risks involved. These women are courageous, and I support their protests for the freedom of their bodies and expression.#WomenofIran #Freedom #Protest

I don't care if an Everton player even scores the winning goal - fuck the whole thing.(Regarding the photo below, I shot this shortly after Peter's garage had been broken into, so his flat was filled with decade's worth of campaign paraphernalia, including the huge rainbow painting behind him which I thought would make a nice backdrop.

Man says he secretly lowered his town’s water fluoride for over a decade - SkynetLabz

The longtime water superintendent for a small town in Vermont has resigned in protest after local officials ordered him to restore the town&#8217;s water to the state&#8217;s standard for fluoride levels—which he had been secretly and unilaterally lowering for years due to his own personal anti-fluoride beliefs. And his righteous, five-page resignation letter offered yet [&hellip;]

Violence killed an estimated 1.28 million people globally in 2013, up from 1.13 million in 1990. In 2013, approximately 842,000 deaths were attributed to self-harm (suicide). World Health Organization categorizes violence into three types: self-inflicted violence, interpersonal conflict and collective violence. Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: family and intimate partner violence. Community violence is defined as violence between unrelated individuals who may or may not know each other.This preliminary classification distinguishes between self-inflicted violence and that inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups, and terrorist organizations. Violence is multicausal, which means that no single factor is responsible for violent behavior. Researchers have looked into a variety of factors that may contribute to violence, such as genetic predisposition and neurochemical abnormalities. Children appear to be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of violence. The majority of violence prevention initiatives focus on young people because the propensity to behave aggressively emerges in childhood.Abused girls are more likely than non-abused girls to develop substance-abuse problems as adults. Prison-based programs aim to reduce the likelihood of reoffending among both violent and nonviolent criminals.To read more click this link below.https://buff.ly/3WgNP3d#violence #love #abuse #domesticviolence #fight #stop #women #art #bhfyp #violenza #violenceagainstwomen #justice #selfdefense #humanrights #crime #violenzasulledonne #police #peace #violenceprevention #donne #violenzapsicologica #fighting #noallaviolenzasulledonne #murder #news #violenzadigenere #trauma #blood #protest #racism

Our event is SOLD OUT. We are delighted the event has received so much support we are also sorry that we cannot accommodate everybody who wishes to attend.T﻿his event discusses the different types of protests that have occurred at cultural venues, how they have changed recently, and the proactive steps that can be taken at cultural venues to better prepare for these types of incidents.W﻿hile we may not stop protests in cultural venues, this event will hopefully provide advice and guidance to be considered by each delegate that managed to get a ticket, enabling them to make informed decisions on how they best manage protests at their venues. #SoldOut #protest #security #onlineevent #museum #gallery #culturalheritage #protection

PTI Workers Protest Angrily In Karachi Over Imran Khan's Assassination.#pronews #pti #workers #protest #karachi #imrankhan #assassination

The situation in Haiti has become increasingly dire due to several overlapping problems. Transportation is severely limited nationally because of gang violence, blockades, protests, and fuel shortages. A gallon of gasoline in Fond-des-Blancs costs between 30 and 40 USD. Because of the high costs and difficulties of transportation, essential goods are in short supply, and the prices of available goods have skyrocketed. The combination of gang violence and fuel shortages has also affected communication networks, so internet connection is rare, and cell phone signal is unreliable. We continue to do our best for the community of Fond-des-Blancs by doing our projects and keeping our doors open.  Sitiyasyon ann Ayiti vinn de pli zan pli grav akòz plizyè pwoblèm ki poze. Transpò vin globalman limite nan tout peyi a akòz vyolans gang, blokaj wout, manifestasyon ak rate gaz. Yon galon gazolin nan Fond-des-Blancs koute ant 30 ak 40 USD. Akòz gwo pri ak difikilte transpòtasyon, machandiz esansyèl yo ra epi pri machandiz ki disponib yo te monte. Konbinezon vyolans gang ak rate gaz te afekte rezo kominikasyon tou, kidonk koneksyon entènèt la pa fasil epi siyal telefòn selilè pa fyab. Nou kontinye fè tout sa nou kapab pou kominote Fond-des-Blancs nan reyalize pwojè nou yo epi kenbe pòt nou louvri.#gangs #foodinsecurity #fuelinsecurity #protest #violence #ayiti #haiti #fondeblan #fonddesblancs #haitian #gangviolence

Author Douglas Murray says a general public effort is needed not to “stand by” as civilisation is “trashed” by end-time cultists. Two climate change activists recently attempted to deface a famous Claude Monet painting at the Barberini Museum by throwing mashed potatoes at it and gluing their hands to the wall. “I don’t simply think we should be observers as our cultural inheritance is despoiled and ruined and has paint and soup and mashed potato thrown against it,” Mr Murray told Sky News host Rita Panahi. “I can’t think of another era in recorded civilised history where people would have just stood by and allowed this to happen.” #climatechange #protest

Locked out. Rejected. Ignored.Beg for help, try to be heard, beg some more.We search for comfort, perspective, and hope that you will feel a sense of dignity when sharing with other “Members of the Tribe”.  It’s not a tribe we chose; our children were born with special needs.It’s quite heartbreaking at times to see the struggles of so many families.  The world has come a long way in addressing human rights, poverty, and disability, but there is much more work to do.I have been fighting for Caila since she was born. Every day begins with a never-ending to-do list: finding therapists, keeping track of academic progress, finding and securing the right resources to support her inclusion at school and in society, creating and working toward goals, and mapping out a path for her future. Then there are the hours of coordinating therapies, homework, reinforcing skills, and learning. The task of helping her feel genuinely included and helping her make and maintain friendships is one of the most daunting of all. It’s little surprise that most parents don’t have the time or energy to address the injustices or fight for a better world.However, as we learn in this week's Torah portion named after its protagonist, Noah teaches us the importance of strong moral principles; it is our duty to register a protest even if it seems likely that it will have little effect. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks z''l explains why:“Silence may be taken as acceptance. And besides, we can never be sure that no one will listen. Morality demands that we ignore probability and focus on possibility. Perhaps someone will take notice and change their ways - and that “perhaps” is enough.”Noah built an Ark to save humanity and the animal kingdom. He is regarded as righteous but not as a leader. He did not gather the people of his generation - a generation that had completely lost its way - to try to convince them to change their behavior. A Hasidic text states that Noah was a righteous man in a fur coat, teaching us that we can choose between keeping ourselves warm in a coat or building a fire to keep everyone warm.  Noah teaches us that it is not good enough to be a "good person", but that we must also be leaders, encouraging others to be part of the change we want to see.When people ask me if I feel all the advocacy I have done has had an impact on the world of inclusion, I answer that change is often evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  I have tremendous gratitude to the leaders before me who stood up to fight injustices and failings towards people with disabilities and created a better world that we benefit from today.As Elana Arian sings in the chorus of her song I Have a Voice, “I have a voice, my voice is powerful, my voice can change the world.”We can change the world.Shabbat shalomFor this & more like it, check out https://lnkd.in/eGWvqM_C #unstoppable #jewishwisdom #protest #downsybdromeawareness #impact #voice

To all my connections: Please sign the petition to end the blood-shead in IranEnd the protest bloodshed in IranNationwide protests sparked by the death in custody of 22-year-old woman, Mahsa (Zhina) Amini, are being brutally quashed by the Iranian authorities. Call on the international community to take action now.On 13 September 2022, Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini was arrested in Tehran by Iran’s so-called “morality” police. Eyewitnesses reported seeing her being violently beaten in a police van. Within hours, she was taken to hospital in a coma, and three days later the 22-year-old died.The “morality” police routinely subject women and girls to arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment for not complying with Iran’s abusive, degrading and discriminatory compulsory veiling laws. Mahsa’s death sparked widespread protests across Iran. The protests have been met with a deadly crackdown.Security forces have repeatedly used unlawful force. They have fired live ammunition and metal pellets at protesters at close range, misused tear gas and water cannons, and severely beaten people with batons. Since Mahsa’s death, we have recorded the deaths of dozens of men, women and children. Hundreds of others have sustained painful and serious injuries, including at least two who have been blinded in one or both eyes. Most are not seeking hospital treatment for fear of arrest, increasing the risk of infection and other health complications. Iranian authorities are shutting down the Internet to hide their crimes.Right now, there is a crisis of impunity in Iran, and it has emboldened the Iranian authorities to kill hundreds of protesters and torture and ill-treat thousands more in recent years without fear of consequences. It is time for states engaging at the UN Human Rights Council to help tackle impunity for grave crimes in Iran.Sign the petition and call on states to set up an independent UN mechanism now to investigate and ensure accountability for the most serious crimes under international law in Iran.https://lnkd.in/eUCsk8D2#womenempowerment #protest #censorship #freedomofspeech #humanrights

"Protest activity will likely increase—possibly significantly—on October 26 to commemorate the 40th day since the regime killed Mahsa Amini. #Protest organizations such as the neighborhood youth groups have continued to call for countrywide demonstrations on October 26.[1] Many protest organizations continue to use revolutionary rhetoric in describing the planned demonstrations.[2] Iranians commonly hold a commemoration on the 40th day after a death. Anti-regime protests similarly erupted 40 days after security forces killed Neda Agha Soltan—a young Iranian protester—during the Green Movement in 2009.[3] Security forces killed Agha Soltan on June 20, 2009, and the commemoration was on July 30, 2009.[4]The regime has likely prepared to preempt and crush the planned #protests on October 26, especially given their potential to strengthen the protest movement. The regime will likely disrupt internet services and telecommunications in the early morning throughout Iran to stymie protester coordination and organization. The regime will also likely deploy #security forces ostentatiously throughout major cities to deter and intimidate demonstrators and use force if the protests gain traction.Protesters may coordinate further demonstrations against the Islamic Republic for the 40-day commemorations of other secular martyrs, such as Nika Shakarami and Sarina Esmail Zadeh, in this protest movement.[5] Forty days after Shakarami disappeared is October 30, and 40 days after Esmail Zadeh died is November 2."

The article delves into the most recent protests happening in Iran spreaded to the world under the slogan “Woman, Life, Freedom”. The suspicious death of the 22-year-old Iranian Mahsa(Zhina) Amini, has triggered a revolution claiming for women's rights all over the country, which undermines the legitimacy of the regime.#Iran #protest #revolution #mahsaamini #iranprotests #iranianprotest #womenrights👉 https://lnkd.in/dkqX8rDC

WEEK 44 TOP 5: DISRUPTION TO SUPPLY CHAIN WATCHLIST #suplychainresilience #businessresilience#supplychain #logistics #transport #freight #port #depot #rail #shippinglines #trucking #manufacturing #retail#theft #strike #unrest #economycrisis#SouthAfrica #SriLanka #Chile #UK #US  - #SouthAfrica Transnet disclosed cable #theft had increased due to low levels of security staff during the previous 12-day #strike, particularly on the #container corridor between commercial hub Johannesburg and the #port of Durban. This resulted in the limited #rail movement at the moment. Transnet has partially lifted Force Majeure restrictions in the automotive, bulk and multi-purpose terminals, however, the force majeure for the container terminals would remain in place until at least 31/Oct.Disruption: rail service between Johannesburg and the #port of Durban - A large #protest caused disruptions in the capital Colombo #SriLanka on 27/Oct. Labour unions and other civil society groups demonstrated governmental response to the ongoing economic situation and alleged state repression. The president immediately declared a state of #emergency, which granted sweeping powers to the military and resulted in a series of crackdowns on protesters, with several protest leaders arrested. Chances of escalation are possible as there seems to be “no let-up” in the ongoing economic crisis, with food inflation topping 85.8% and non-food at 62.8%.Disruption: ongoing protest, unrest -#Port workers in #Chile took a two-day #strike action from 26/Oct. to demand better working conditions through an agreement with the country’s government, affecting #ports of Antofagasta, San Antonio, Iquique, and San Vicente.Disruption: delays, possible strikes again - #UK Liverpool dockers started their third round of #strike action on 24/Oct. after the collapse of negotiations between union representatives and #port management. The strike is expected to last till 7/Nov. With previous Felixstowe strikes, industrial actions hit #supplychains badly, and now the holiday peak and Christmas are around the corner.Disruption: delays, transport solution changes, possible congestions due to the backlogs, increasing risk for loss of #sales - The #US #railroads and unions have been negotiating a new contract and previously Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) was assigned to resolve the labour dispute and avert a strike (see Week#38 Top 5). While now the group representing the freight railroads in negotiations, six out of 12 unions have voted to ratify their agreements, and two recently voted against it. This may result in a #strike that would hit the #freight #rail system as early as 19/Nov.Disruption: possible strike hit freight rail operation, service suspension, delays

The Public Order Bill is back in the House of Commons. Its extreme measures will criminalise protest in the UK. They include Serious Disruption Prevention Orders, which can ban people from protests and place them under surveillance  just for attending protest in the past. The police will have increased stop and search powers and even people who observe or support protest actions can be criminalised.

The war in Ukraine is not trendy anymore, but it is still a problem, affecting millions of people. Many are now realising it due to the increased prices affecting their daily lives, but still forgetting about all the Ukrainian and Russian lives that are being changed forever due to this war.I am in Sweden and it is not possible for me to go now to Ukraine nor Romania to medically support people fleeing the war as I would love to do again. However, I am lucky my roommate and dear friend Martim Costa is engaged in this cause too. If in the past I helped him finding a volunteering opportunity in Ukraine, now he helped me to make a difference right from where we are. Last month we joined Russians Against War and helped them to prepare for a protest that is going to take place in November in Stockholm.You can watch the video about it in the link below.I would just like to urge everyone to do their part (however small). Let’s keep on talking about it. Let's keep on making noise.#ukrainewar #russianinvasion #putinswar #protest #NoBloodForGas

Images of a rare anti-communist banner posted on a roadside of Beijing just before the supreme political assembly was held for the first time in five years quickly went viral on social media. The banner that read, “We want food instead of PCR tests. We want freedom instead of lockdowns.” was just as swiftly removed from Chinese internet as it was put up. No relevant news was found on Hong Kong media about it afterwards.Various banners have subsequently emerged in different places around the country, with some calling for strikes on markets and schools, and the removal of the country’s leader Xi Jinping.Read the full story by Sun Ma on FairPlanet: https://lnkd.in/dg5AReHY#China #censorship #democracy #freedom #protest #leadership #internet #socialmedia

In honor of LGBTQ+ History Month, we are highlighting LGBT activist Peter Tatchell. Peter Gary Tatchell is a British human rights campaigner, originally from Australia, best known for his work with LGBT social movements. Tatchell was selected as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey in 1981. Just this week, Tatchell was "arrested and detained on the kerbside" in Doha on Tuesday following his one-man protest challenging the country's treatment of LGBT people ahead of the World Cup. The decision to stage the World Cup in Qatar, a country where homosexuality can be punishable by death, has been heavily criticised since Fifa made the announcement in 2010. During this protest, 70 year old Tatchell stated, "I hope that every other national team will follow their lead and that all team captains will devote 30 seconds of every post-match news conference to affirm their commitment to the rights of LGBTs, women and migrant workers.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said he would announce the date for his much-publicised mega protest next week to press for the dissolution of the National Assembly and announce snap polls in the country. Khan, 70, was disqualified on Friday by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for failing to inform it about the money he received after selling the state gifts, also known as the Toshakhana case.Khan made the comments while addressing a press conference along with Senator Azam Swati, who was granted bail by a local court in a case about his controversial tweet against Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.“I will announce the date of the long march on either Thursday or Friday,” he said.Khan also confirmed that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was having parleys with the federal government, but added that he was not expecting a meaningful outcome from them.https://lnkd.in/d6xfCCDY#Pakistan #ImranKhan #PTI #protest #news #KhaleejTimes

Aurora residents opposed to providing $50 million in public funding and free land to the owner of Hollywood Casino rallied in front of city hall and spoke against the proposal at a city committee meeting Tuesday.We are sharing an artist rendering of the proposed casino development, which was presented to the public at the meeting. We have requested a copy of that presentation from the city but have not received a reply.David Cannon was one of those who offered public comment against the city helping the casino finance its move from downtown Aurora to Farnsworth Avenue, and he shared the following letter with members of the media, which we are reprinting. His views are his own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Talking Cities.#aurorail #casino #casinogaming #publicfunding #municipalbonds #protestAn open Letter to the Aurora City Council:Esteemed Alderpeople,I write to you today so that your friends, family, and neighbors will read it and perhaps discuss its contents with you. Like myself, most people are probably not tuned in to all the comings and goings of our city’s government. But this casino deal is so bad, so egregious, that I had to speak up.Per the terms of this deal, the City of Aurora will provide $50 million in general obligation bond funds to sweeten the pot. The city’s Office of Economic Development clarified that this is probably closer to $58 million when you include all interest and fees. Furthermore, the city will give the casino upwards of $10 million worth of land to use for the project.Municipal bonds should not be used in this manner. We should be using public money to fund public projects like roads, sewers, libraries, parks – things that will benefit all of our citizens. Instead, this is a massive subsidy to an already massive corporation that will only add to their profit margin.In 2021, PENN Entertainment made $2.75 billion in gross profit and its CEO, Jay Snowden, personally made $65 million. They can afford to build this casino outright. They’re just seeing if we’re foolish enough to give them money and land anyway.Do you represent PENN Entertainment or do you represent the people of Aurora?My simple request:Vote NO on the proposed ordinance.Hold town halls to determine whether Aurorans want to give this corporation a handout for a new casino. Hint – they don’t.If there is still public appetite for a new casino, go back to the table and renegotiate with PENN Entertainment, and take our bond money and free land off the table.I know it will be hard to say no, but this is a bad deal and it needs to be reworked. I ask you to do what is right, not what is easy.Thank you for your attention and consideration.David CannonAurora, IL

CAN YOU SPARE A FEW BUCKS TO HELP FIGHT INJUSTICE IN SA?For over a year now, Change.org has enabled people like us, to decide not to put up with what bothers us and fight. Only this week, Change.org worked on campaigns to ensure that a hospital in KZN didn’t shut down its child care facilities; that the animal welfare sector is not stripped of its funding; and that rapists and the corrupt are disqualified from running for public office (which they currently are not).If Change.org didn’t exist, millions of people in South Africa (over 60 million, to be specific) wouldn’t be able to get up every morning and sign petitions like the ones above... And this is a real possibility.The reality is that Change.org needs just 100 new members by the end of the month in order to move forward and secure the future of Change.org in South Africa. They count on people like you, because we are independent from businesses and governments.Please help Change.org to continue creating change in this world and our country that needs it so desperately.#change #petitions #fightcorruption #fightinjustice #protest #southafrica #activism #fightthepower #peoplefirst #business #statecapture #doj #npa #hawks #saps #justiceforall #crimeandpuinishment #help #donate #supportagoodcause #ethics #goodpractice #funding #crowdfundingcampaign #supportlocal https://lnkd.in/dqMGF6Y6

🇮🇷 Collective Cyber Attacks by Hacktivists: What’s Going on in Iran?Iran is under the influence of a massive hacktivism attack that has recently begun and is still ongoing. The protests, which began following the death of a young Iranian woman named Masha Amini, echoed in the digital world. Masha Amini was detained on September 13 by the Iranian morality police. During detention, she went into a coma on the same day and was taken to the hospital. On September 16, unfortunately, she died in Tehran Hospital. Iranian official authorities announced that Masha died after a heart attack. However, her family and some Iranians blamed the police for her death. The protests started after the death of Masha Amini and spread to many cities, especially in the country’s western part, after her funeral in Saqqez on September 17. The protests, which resulted in violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces, brought digital restrictions.

Aileen Getty, u weet wel, van de familie die rijk is geworden met het groene beauty & wellness resort Spa Getty 😋 I fund climate activism – and I applaud the Van Gogh protest | Aileen Getty | The Guardian> When I saw the video, my first reaction was shock. Throwing soup on a beloved painting was a desperate move. What could possibly motivate a young person to do such a thing? This is where we find ourselves after decades of mostly incremental activism which has brought us to the point of a collapsing planet, engulfed in flame and drought, and burning to the ground. Activists are trying everything they can to get our attention. How far is too far to get the attention of people in immediate danger?> I am the daughter of a famous family who built their fortune on fossil fuels – but we now know that the extraction and use of fossil fuels is killing life on our planet. Our family sold that company four decades ago, and I instead vowed to use my resources to take every means to protect life on Earth.> People often come up with theories about my motivation to engage in the climate movement. My motivation is clear: I am fighting for a livable planet for my family and yours. I am not dwelling on the past. I am looking to build a better future.https://lnkd.in/ezf8QpPeAileen Getty | Climate Emergecy FundAileen is the Founding Donor of the Climate Emergency Fund.

On contrary Govt assured that MSP is here to stay and #farmers should not get misled. Here is increased msp for Desh ka Kisaan.I don't blame farmers, but what about Political faces that were spreading #propaganda .When will they say sorry for misleading, and causing all the wastage of National resources, man hours during the protest?When will #mediahouse say sorry for cooking stories that confused simple people of country ??https://lnkd.in/gyRHd6VD.

When you have the power to change the system, then what's stopping you?The below article by India Development Review (IDR) by Shachi Nelli and Shonottra Kumar describes many established ways for citizens to engage with governments—some derived from laws and some directly from communities. There is no one right way to engage; instead, the democratic setup offers many avenues for citizens to explore how they wish to communicate with the government and each other.Be the change-maker!

There are no two ways about it. China's zero covid policy, whether in its original incarnation or its 'dynamic' version, is a failure in progress.Imposing rolling lockdowns on modern cities with populations in the millions with a view to suppressing an airborne respiratory virus is an impossible task and it's not working.A brief lull in the number of 'cases' under strict lockdown conditions is always followed by another flare-up necessitating a further lockdown perpetuating the never-ending cycle.The Chinese people have had enough.The tyrannical imposition of the zero covid policy is certainly not the regime's only failing.However, as I have long predicted, it will likely transform into the straw that finally breaks this obstinate camel's back and turn formerly obedient masses against the regime.The demands, for want of a better word, in the large banners hung on a flyover in Beijing last week in a rare instance of protest showing remarkable courage and defiance are telling.One of the banners said:"We want food, not PCR tests. We want freedom, not lockdowns. We want respect, not lies. We want reform, not a Cultural Revolution. We want a vote, not a leader. We want to be citizens, not slaves".A second one is reported to have called for a boycott of schools, strikes and the removal of Xi. History tells us that regimes that ignore demands of this sort while they are still within the realm of 'reasonableness' soon find themselves faced with wider-ranging ones that they are not prepared to accede to, planting the seeds of a protracted social unrest.  How the CPC responds to the resentment building up within Chinese society towards lockdowns and arbitrary restrictions of basic liberties, purportedly to win a tossing contest against a 'West' that really could care less about whether or not China succeeds in its insane covid zero drive, will be instrumental with respect to the direction in which this feeling will be channelled going forward. #travelrestrictions #motivation #inspiration #strategy #bestadvice #gettingthingsdone #covid19pandemic #covid19news #covid19response #lockdowns #authoritarian #China #future #lockdown2021 #lockdown #Australia #politicsandlaw #auspol #humanrights #mentalhealth #tyranny #publichealth #protest #ExUngueLeonem

The Guardian [excerpt]: Reports that a 16-year-old girl has died in a #Covid #quarantine centre after pleas from her family for medical help were ignored have caused anger in #China, where ongoing tight #pandemic controls have started to take their toll on a weary population.Videos of the girl have spread across Chinese #socialmedia in the last 24 hours. The distressing footage, which the Guardian has not been able to independently verify, shows the teenager ill, struggling to breathe and convulsing in a bunk bed at what is purported to be a quarantine centre in #Ruzhou, #Henan province.In the video, a woman who claims she is the girl’s aunt says her niece died after exhibiting a fever, experiencing convulsions and vomiting. She said the family had been asking for medical help but none came for days and calls to official phone lines went unanswered.“We have been calling for help since 3am last night, including the mayor’s hotline and centre for disease control and prevention line, and we couldn’t get through,” she said. “I just want all my family and friends to see this video and spread it, so I can find a place for help, and seek justice. I just want to know what is the reason behind her death.”The video comes as Communist leaders are meeting in #Beijing for their party congress – the most important meeting of China’s five-year political cycle. Authorities have been under pressure to ensure there are no signs of unrest during the meeting but frustration has broken through.Last week, in a rare #protest in Beijing, incendiary slogans against Xi Jinping, including references to anger at strict Covid policies, were hung from a central overpass. The same slogans have begun to appear in other locations.In Henan, which has a population of nearly 100 million people, 26 cases were reported on Tuesday and 13 on Monday. But China’s zero-Covid policy requires authorities to contain and eliminate all outbreaks. It has resulted in sudden lockdowns on buildings, neighbourhoods and cities, and the mass quarantining of cases and people considered “close contacts”.There are reports of thousands of people in Ruzhou being taken into centralised quarantine in recent weeks. The girl’s aunt said six members of their family were quarantined and that her niece was not sick when she first arrived.#news

https://lnkd.in/eNY_fR2Y“Home Secretary Suella Braverman reeled off a long list of people she dislikes, including the "Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati".”Right to #freedomofspeech / #freedomofexpression and #protest is a key right enshrined in modern jurisprudence - it only takes a quick search for cases such as Director of Public Prosecutions v Ziegler and others [2021] UKSC 23, R v Thacker and Ors [2021] EWCA Crim 97 and Jones et al v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [2019] EWHC 2957 (Admin), but who cares for #law and #jurisprudence these days, right? Even when the Home Sec is a former #publiclaw practitioner they don’t seem to matter - after all, who are the #courtofappeal and #supremecourt to say anything, when the #westminster #people seem to know it all?We don’t need a British equivalent of #putin’s #autocracy in the U.K. today, thank you very much, Suella Braverman. And for those that have any doubts, #putinwarcriminal jails people for up to 15 years for protest - let that sink in for a minute. Perhaps all it boils down to is that Suella Braverman loathes to admit that she secretly likes tofu. But then again, I don’t profess to know what’s in the fridge. My lepta - this is a personal opinion piece protected by recent #jurisprudence in cases such as McNally v Saunders [2021] EWHC 2012 (QB) and Banks v Cadwalladr [2022] EWHC 1417 (QB)#publiclaw #administrativelaw #freedomofspeech #freespeech #freedomofexpression #righttoknow #protest #protests #autocracy #totalitarianism #dictatorship #censorship #police

The suspect has been charged with the rape and murder of a minor, along with counts of torture and abuse. She shared the details of being a victim of domestic abuse in 2018 with the authorities, along with her confession of the murder.The police are looking into an argument between Dahbia and Lola’s parents, who were the guardians of the building where her sister resided. They had refused to give Dahbia an access badge. The motive of the murder, however, still remains unclear. While it could be an act of revenge, the police haven’t dismissed the possibility of it being an unjustified murder.It is noteworthy that the numbers 1 and 0 were found imprinted by a device on Lola’s body. However, the significance of the numbers has not yet been identified by the police.Continue reading at Link.Article by: Sanika Mandaogade (@sanikaaa18)Image sources: Yahoo/Freepik/SaltWire/New York Post#thesparrownews #murdermystery #immigration #france #victim #rapecase #rapevictim #immigrationlaw #murder #justice #women #feminism #protest #womanpower #womenempowerment #news #currentaffairs #upsc #upscmotivation
