Being an expat 😊 Many with career aspirations would like to have an international experience. I was no different and so when opportunity came, packed my bags and landed in Deutschland. The best lesson that an #expatlife teaches is #resilience . Reason why below 😊 1. One fine day you realize that the 4 languages you speak suddenly becomes null and void and you are back to a language school learning a foreign language starting from A, B,C, D.....But trust me its #fun 2. You were the finest communicator moderating many workshops and one fine morning you dont understand a word spoken in a meeting you were invited..... But trust me it makes you feel you need to #restart again3. Weekends were mostly with lot of friends and family. But one weekend you realize, you are all alone..But trust me it motivates you to be #extrovert and make new friends4. Adjusting to the new culture. When Dosa and Biriyani is your favourite food but you need to find solace in Pretzel.... But trust me that teaches you #survivalskills 5. Learning new technologies and topics... Trust me it keeps the #hunger  onBut the journey is amazing. Only who has been through can understand. Fortunately I am loving every it of it. Thankful to my new colleagues Karsten Stolze Sarah Kistner who made me so comfortable.Thanks to my mentor Karsten Mueller who never allowed me to be in my comfort zone 😄 . Thanks to all my gurus back in India with whom I worked and who made me capable.Last but not the least, thanks to my better half Somduity Bhattacharjee who shares the journey with me#boschindia #boschler #bosch #experience

I spent my childhood and teenage years in Lebanon. Many habits and traditions from my life there stayed with me. One of those was that beautiful conversations with family, friends and new acquaintances cannot be complete without something delicious to eat together. Sharing food with others in Lebanese culture creates more bonding. So I decided in true Lebanese style to bring along some of my home baked delicious chocolate brownies 😋 to the Feel At Home Fair tomorrow. It’s a limited supply so get there early 😃. What: Feel At Home Fair in The Hague.Where: The British School, VlaskampWhen: Sunday 6 November.You will find me on the first floor. Look for Recipes4Change, or follow the smell of chocolate brownies 😃. I look forward to conversing, eating and bonding with you at the fair. See you tomorrow. #feelathome #international #community #brownies #meaningfulconversations #bonding #fun #coach #counsellor #thehague

🚗 Het is 08:10 uur, geen files en Marcel staat al op de stoep bij het NH Hotel in Den Haag. Z'n auto is afgeladen met legosteentjes. Backstage via de goederenlift is hij snel bij de zaal voor de workshop. Nou ja, workshop, meer een wedstrijd. We doen ook LEGO SERIOUS PLAY, maar dit is iets anders. Dit is maatwerk. Speciaal voor het Deloitte Architecture Team werkten we een uitdagend programma uit.🚀 We starten om 09:10 uur, net na het ontbijt. Vijftig Deloitters verdeeld over 10 groepjes raken direct verwikkeld in een strijd wie de hoogste toren bouwt. Een simpele opdracht met 200% engagement, iedereen doet mee. Na het uitdelen van de punten voor de winnaars is er direct een tweede opdracht. Tussendoor laat Marcel wat tips en tricks zien.😱 De grootste uitdaging is de derde en laatste opdracht: de "Deloitte Team Machine". Een soort mechanische knikkerbaan waarbij alle teams een soort machine bouwen. Iedere machine brengt de knikkers steeds een stapje verder. De hersenen van de meeste teamleden beginnen direct te ratelen. Anderen kijken nog even de kat uit de boom. Om de teams op weg te helpen met de techniek zijn er drie werkende voorbeelden. Ook is er voor elk team een startpakket met basisonderdelen zoals een accupack, elektromotor, tandwielen, assen, etcetera. En Marcel biedt waar nodig een helpende hand. Fantastisch om te zien hoe alle teams samenwerken en een eigen draai aan hun bouwsel geven. 👷‍♂️ Na een uurtje bouwen staan er tien geweldige bouwsels. Eén voor één geven de teamcaptains een demonstratie van hun bouwwerk. Allemaal scoren ze punten. Een paar machines springen er uit qua aankleding, concept en werking. Dat betekent extra punten op het scorebord.🏆 Met de prijsuitreiking rond 11:00 uur wint team 6 de Lego Challenge. Groot applaus. Marcel rijkt ze een op maat gemaakte legotrofee uit. Iedereen is enthousiast en opgewarmd voor de rest van de teamdag. Marcel rijdt voldaan weer naar huis. Hier had je bij willen zijn!#thepowerofbricks #teambuilding #fun

"I don't support the traditional system of Schooling" 😶This wasn't said by any celebrity but my big brother who has a baby of 3 years. She has not been admitted to school till now, astonishing isn't it? I even thought the same and asked my brother why so? Then my brother asked my niece, let's a play a game, with each letter of English alphabet say 5 words. The game began, guess what the first word for A was not apple it was 🐊 alligator, I was shook!She knew every meaning of the words she was telling. Then I was as if diving into ocean of miracles, she told 1 to 30 number in ascending order, she didn't stop here she counted the numbers from descending order as well. In between telling my brother "oh you don't know papa" as my brother was acting to make mistakes while reciting the same numbers backwards.😅From that day I got just another view of education system, pressure less way to learn. I remember my school days, upto my graduation level the teachers and professors always focused on marks just mugging up the history, geography and even science sometimes. Even you must have faced the same thing at one point of your life where your marks in #mathematics got cut just because you didn't follow the method your maths teacher taught you.🙂In short not a single scope of using our brain independently. Looking at the #MBA school way of learning, the #IITs being taught, the recent news of #bitspilani students being allowed to take a year leave for starting their startups shows us we can never learn or grow to an exceptional level if we are not allowed to think, explore and do things independently. Even in our job life, people with exceptional performance just not limit themselves to the daily work they do, they read, write, learn and try to think #outofthebox .Don't know about you, but I am very much convinced by my brother's approach of learning in the way of playing. Gaining #knowledge should be #fun not a competition isn't it?#traditional #schooling #education #school #teachers #learning #science #teacher #students #startups

When you make a mistake, laugh it off. This shows that you're human and that you're not perfect. It also shows that you're #confident enough to laugh at yourself.Use self-deprecating #humour in your #marketing materials. This can help to endear potential #customers to your #brand.Share stories about times when things didn't go as planned. Again, this helps to show that you're human and that you're not afraid to admit when things don't go right.Make #fun of your competition. This can be a great way to get attention and show that you're not afraid to take on the big guys.Here are some funny honest marketing lines used by big brands:-#Lays'Who said you can't charge for air?'#Netflix"Pay us $12 to spend an hour picking what to watch, before giving up and falling asleep."#Kurkure "Tedha hai par mera hai?"Don't forget to comment some more such funny taglines!

But you're not alone. ⁣⁣Most people who are successful have a board of advisors or a peer group that they spend time with regularly. ⁣⁣When you surround yourself with people who challenge you to be your absolute best, you will discover new versions of yourself and develop solutions you would have never come up with on your own. ⁣⁣And that's why we've created a powerful peer group and board of advisors for business owners just like you.⁣⁣𝗪𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗽𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟯.⁣⁣It’s amazing what happens with a group of dedicated members show up and use their combined knowledge and experience to propel each other’s businesses to the next level. ⁣⁣It’s one of the most powerful experiences I’ve been a part of to drive business growth. ⁣⁣If you are ready for this level of engagement, accountability and business growth –> DM me “Board Of Directors”⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣ #giveback #ambition #leadership #business #successquotes #smallbusiness #motivation #inspiration #vision #abundance #powerful #attitude #jairekrobbins #results #focus #perception #Inspirational #thinkdifferent #inspirationalquotes #inspirationalwords #insight #simpletruth #growthmindset #selflove #selfcare #healthylifestyle #Repost #happy #fun #instadaily

"Mr Sand Dog bring me your dreams" Daring to dream got us to here. Nothing could take away my dreams. Much happened in my life where I could have lost sight of them, lost touch with them and life itself. I fought so hard to hold on to my belief that there was something better in my life. There was. It was worth the struggle and then some. There was Kratu and that dream came true. My dream now is that Kratu is seen by more people. He is a star. He makes people smile. He is uplifting. In this world today we need Kratu. Living in the moment. Being in the moment. Loving what you do and doing what you love. #fun #moments #dowhatyoulove #smile #uplifting #inspireothers #believe #dreambig #dreamscometrue #kratu #doglovers #dogs #dogsoflinkedin #overcomingadversity #autism #adhd #ptsd #nevergiveup

For individuals whose lives are impacted by trauma, the human right to play does not necessarily feel natural, available, or possible. Traumatic stress often robs us of the capacity for joy, curiosity, and enlivenment. So just how do we rekindle their playful spirit?

Take an acorn and place it on concrete inside a building, what’s going to happen? It won’t grow. It’s going to die. It’s going to slowly wither and dry out. But put it in the earth and give it access to the right nutrients, sunshine, rain etc… it will blossom ... into a beautiful majestic, unique oak tree like no other… it will self-actualize into itself. It will of course take time, as it needs to go through a process, a never-ending progress of growth…  Your greatest potential is inside of you, like an acorn, you just need the right conditions and nowadays that can be hard to find. That's where I come in. I can't wait to be by your side. Enjoy the video, with music.#Coaching #Potential #Selfactualization #videomaking #fun #comingsoon Hari De Miranda Seba Marchini

Feedback on FitCon Florida - Small, but mighty event that will only improve in years to come. I definitely enjoyed it, however would have liked to see a greater showing of vendors. I was able to walk the entire vendor circuit multiple times in the hour I was there. The competition crowd was massive, and I would highly recommend setting a booth up for your brand in the future.

I will be in Colorado for half of 2023 which means we can use the same online and in person format that has been fantastic here at home in the Alps.

#Fun factorWhen Alex was little, we often went to places like #chesington, We visited his grandparents place and we would have dinner together and play with his cousins. Here is England is mostly rains, so bike rides are mostly reserved for the summer. So on days when we had little planned, a film or cartoon movie seemed to be the obvious #choice.Yesterday, we watched Toy Story 4, this had a very different feel to it than it's predecessors. Apart from the fact it had more of a cartoon feel to it, the main theme seemed to circle on time travel. It was lovely to spend time together do something different we all #enjoy and it got Alex thinking about if time travel is real. I wonder if this is the start of physics and the black hole phenomenon.It's good to spend time as a family and #plan #joy. Do you have a favourite hobby you enjoy as a family? What other activities would you recommend for an 11 year old? Perhaps chess or monopoly or scrabble? It's not all #work!  We must #build those #memories too. #iandyoumatter

CBS News Radio said, “That’s Caesar whose singing brings back Nat King Cole” while the Screen Actors Guild enthused “Caesars’ smooth velvet voice has often been compared to Nat King Cole’s, but he has his own interpretation and style that compares to no one but is essentially and superbly…Caesar.” Most recently he headlined at The Kennedy Center for The Performing Arts on February 26, 2022 and signed autographs for an hour after his performance with the symphony. A Chicago native, Caesar toured the world accompanying GRAMMY winner Julio Iglesias, becoming the first and only male vocalist ever to tour with the global superstar’s band. Caesar’s vocals stand front and center, powerfully delivered with poise, elegance, and grace. He sings jazz standards and love ballads in five languages, which he aims to do at performing arts centers around the world. About the Charles Bender Performing Arts CenterRenovated in 2015, the Charles Bender Performing Arts Center is a thriving theater located in downtown Humble.

Their follow-up album, In the Heart of the Young, was released in 1990 and just like their first album, reached platinum. It peaked at #15 on Billboard’s Top 200 and hits off this album include “Can’t Get Enuff”, “Miles Away” and “Easy Come Easy Go”.

CBS News Radio said, “That’s Caesar whose singing brings back Nat King Cole” while the Screen Actors Guild enthused “Caesars’ smooth velvet voice has often been compared to Nat King Cole’s, but he has his own interpretation and style that compares to no one but is essentially and superbly…Caesar.” Most recently he headlined at The Kennedy Center for The Performing Arts on February 26, 2022 and signed autographs for an hour after his performance with the symphony. A Chicago native, Caesar toured the world accompanying GRAMMY winner Julio Iglesias, becoming the first and only male vocalist ever to tour with the global superstar’s band. Caesar’s vocals stand front and center, powerfully delivered with poise, elegance, and grace. He sings jazz standards and love ballads in five languages, which he aims to do at performing arts centers around the world. About the Charles Bender Performing Arts CenterRenovated in 2015, the Charles Bender Performing Arts Center is a thriving theater located in downtown Humble.

Winger with Lita Ford in ConcertFriday, November 25Arena Theatre Winger and Lita Ford together in concert! Two rock legends on one historic stage live! WingerHard rock greats Winger - formed by former Alice Cooper band member Kip Winger - burst out of New York City with a debut album, "Winger," that achieved platinum status in the United States and gold in Japan and Canada. Winger stayed on the Billboard Top 200 chart for over 60 weeks, where it peaked at #21. It spawned such hits as “Seventeen” and “Headed for a Heartbreak.” In 1990, Winger was nominated for an American Music Award for “Best New Heavy Metal Band”. Their follow-up album, In the Heart of the Young, was released in 1990 and just like their first album, reached platinum. It peaked at #15 on Billboard’s Top 200 and hits off this album include “Can’t Get Enuff”, “Miles Away” and “Easy Come Easy Go”. Winger has made a name for themselves with relentless touring, while winning fans and critics alike because of their exceptional musicianship, Kip Winger’s powerful vocals and the band’s incredible songwriting. Lita FordLita Ford is one of the all-time great female rock guitar players, having established herself at just sixteen as lead guitarist for the legendary all-girl band The Runaways. Her leads were an integral part of the band's sound. The band's talent and drive lifted them above the novelty of their bad-girl image and launched successful solo careers for Ford and Joan Jett. Following The Runaways' breakup, Ford launched a solo career with the debut album, "Out for Blood." Her next release, "Dancin' on the Edge" and Ford's popularity began to rise. The single "Fire in My Heart", reached the Top 10 in several countries. The follow-up single, "Gotta Let Go," reached number one on the Mainstream Rock charts. The ballad "Close My Eyes Forever", a duet with Ozzy Osbourne, is her most successful song, reaching No. 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Ticket Range: $45 - $75+Ticket Link: https://lnkd.in/dxGnECER \ Arena Theatre 7326 Southwest Freeway | Houston, Texas 77074 Box Office Ticket Request Line: 713-772-5900 Box Office Hours: Monday through Friday 10am to 6pm Day of Show: 5pm to 10:00pm See more and buy tickets at: https://arenahouston.com  #concert #music #great #lost #houston #texas #live #performance #friday #rock #fun #arena #tour #event #metal
