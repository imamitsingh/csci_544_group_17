Bittersweet day. Drove down to Austin for the funeral of my dear friend, Ray Avila. It was a sad and touching ceremony. Ray was a great guy who was loved by everyone who met him. But, there was also a bit of a reunion from my KFI days. That’s Mike Nolan “KFI in The Sky” on the left and former KFI/KOST production guy Gil Perez in the middle. Funny thing about me and Gil. We grew up on the same street, El Chino Circle, in Buena Park, CA. He’s a little older than me. But we ended up in the same career and working at a few of the same stations. Small world. It was nice to see them and spend some time catching up. I just wish it could’ve been under better circumstances. #radio #talkradio #kfi #broadcast #broadcasting #broadcastmedia #media #funeral #sad #friends #kost

Twitter WHAT A CLUSTER!!!! It's embarassing... Not sure lenders and other investors are so happy currently...This is how not to take over a company and implement change. Hope Tesla shareholders are noticing this as well. Elon Musk is clearly brilliant but proving the adage to stick in your lane!!!!

Hey, My Dear LinkedIn . . . People are getting fired. People are earning 7 Lakhs/Month. People are joining FAANG.People are posting screenshots for eve-teasing. People are missing their Ex. People are not getting any hooks.People are cursing Elon Musk. Startup’s are shutting down.Didi/Bhaiya are getting sponsorship from Scaler, Hirect etc for paid promotion. Didi/Bhaiya are giving some random gyan with a selfie attached at last. I think LinkedIn is only the saddest platform without the #sad 😢 reaction.  #dukhdardpeeda #randomdevatnight

Dumb.Biden cut down the Keystone Pipeline as his first action taken as President. That killed 13,000 jobs that paid over $100K per year and killed any hope for energy self sufficiency. Keystone Pipeline has been built from Alberta to the Can/US border. Parts of the Keystone have already been built in USA. Pipeline would have been in production in 2022.That pipeline was to carry Canadian heavy oil to Gulf Coast refineries to process into heating oil, jet fuel, gas and over 200 oil based products.Gulf refineries need raw materials to meet demand. Without pipeline, demand cannot be met- not enough supply.Result, heating oil shortage and now record high prices. This is going to absolutely gut business and household budgets in NE that use Heating oil.So now Biden offered up$12.5 B in new inflationary taxpayers money to offer subsidies to those who simply do not have the money to pay for Biden’s sky high heating oil.This is a disaster. If you live in the NE you know what I am talking about. It is Biden’s policies that have killed hard working honest Democrats the opportunity to win in next weeks elections.Democrats have proven that they simply do not know how to manage our economy nor have the listening and understanding DNA in their make up. #Sad.

I am shocked I found one point I agree with @Elonmusk about (cos I just blocked him on my twitter again for nagging about $8 to all!) It takes a lot of trowelling around the manure of Harvard's outer China-complicity-crust to find the "gem" that reflects UN Bestpractices in the Harvard Business Review....I don't understand why it is such hard work for them to listen to their Own "Voice of Conscience" coming from within their own ranks (different institution).....still....when one finds it, one should show genuine endorsement of it. I approve this observation of ESG....the average midlevel management has about as much chance of living up to the SDG standards as "camel fitting through the eye of a needle"!

Back in 2013 I experienced SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) for the first time. It was like being hit by a bus. I'd left the UK in 2001 and had forgotten how tough autumn/winter can be here. I'd returned from Singapore in May just in time for the British Summer.It was this time of year (the last Gardener's World episode had just been broadcast, it's my annual reminder to watch out). I had to cancel a work trip to India, I was barely in a fit state to make it as far as my kitchen so forget about making a long haul flight.This was before I'd retrained as a Health Coach but I was already aware of how much I could do for myself vs the GP's solution of a prescription. Today I know what I'm up against, I start to plan for it in Spring.I make sure that I get Vitamin D (from the sun) as soon as it's available in late March/early April.I supplement with Vitamin D when it's no longer naturally available. Through genetic testing I know that my Vitamin D receptors aren't working as efficiently as they could so the supplementation helps to manage this.I get outside first thing in the morning to support my circadian rhythm... which is where the sunrise comes in. Getting enough quality sleep is also key.Finally I make sure that I'm outside for at least an hour in daylight. It might be a walk, gardening or working outside. This is critical at this time of year.All of these things help - there's a relationship between Vitamin D and serotonin which is why focusing on this has really helped. So far it hasn't raised it's ugly head again.#seasonalaffectivedisorder #SAD #mentalhealth #healthcoach

There are times in life when we're faced with unforeseen circumstances. And this is one of those times. They say for a new journey to start, an old one has to end. I am sad that my journey with Prodigy Education is coming to an end. But at the same time, I am proud to have worked at this remarkable organization. The people and culture here have taught me to be a better version of myself and I will forever be grateful to Prodigy for that. This was sudden and to be honest, I'm still in denial about this happening in reality. And yet, I can't help but appreciate how ethically and empathetically Prodigy brought this news to us. Yet another reason that makes this journey all the more memorable and hard to accept that it's actually coming to an end.#people #culture #help #education #grateful #layoffs #layoff #sad #forever #bonds #job #india #bengaluru

Spring forward, fall back 🕰I really don’t mind when the clocks go forward an hour to adjust to summer and daylight savings, but when the clocks go backwards in the autumn I am a complete mess 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴SAD. Seasonal Affective Disorder. It’s a thing. The older I get, the worse it seems to be, and I guess it doesn’t really help that I have chosen to live in Sweden at 59° N.The darkness is really setting in now, and for the last week I’ve felt really tired, and [let’s be real here 🙃] a little depressed at the fact it’s going to get darker and darker still for the next six weeks until the solstice. I’ve been sluggish, have not focused as well as I normally do, and I definitely haven’t had my usual levels of will power to cross off everything on my to-dos.Now more than ever I really appreciate that we work async at Remote, meaning that I can truly shift my working day around to capitalise on the few hours of sunlight we get up here to work with my energy in the most basic of ways, and that it’s not an issue.I’m now officially on “winter mode” which for me means switching on my SAD lamp every morning, eating a later breakfast and lunch, moving my dog’s walks around to daylight hours and blocking my diary so nobody can book over this sacred time, catching up on call recordings from under a blanket, and lighting a candle by my desk for extra cosiness, scandi style. But the best thing about async and working remote is that if I really need a power nap and my calendar allows for it, I will take that lovely delicious nap and give myself the boost I need. Being able to listen to my body, and not having an ounce of guilt over it is very much an evolved version of Fiona, and I love it.So, it got me thinking… Surely I am not alone in my behaviours, even though nobody ever talks about it 🤭#fionaspolls #soitgotmethinking #lifeworkbalance #async #asynchronouswork #myschedulemylife #efficiency #energy #powernap #wellbeing #work #mode #winteriscoming #sad

Deeply saddened to hear of how the employees in Twitter are learning about their fate today. It feels cold and cruel to me. Employees are human and have hearts. Surely there is a kinder and more respectufl way to deliver this difficult news to your people. I encountered a situation like this in my early 20's when working in NY and was shocked to see how loyal employees were told that they were unfortunately going to be made redundant and in the next moment walked to the exit door and passwords changed. This experience never left me. So hearing about this today brought this back to me but on a much larger scale. Not a good day for capitalism, and a sad day for all the impacted employees of Twitter. Thinking of you all today.#sad

Is it just me or is anyone else really disturbed by this?I keep seeing announcements from various organisations about the creation of warm banks and whilst I would always celebrate the generosity and compassion of these organisations, I can’t help being really disturbed that in 2022, this is something we are actually having to do - create spaces for people to be able to keep warm and fed. My head finds it hard to compute that I’m living in a country where this is now a reality.  #keepwarm #community #sad #21stcentury

I write about Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) every year about the same time of year because as the light starts to fade and change, like many others,  I can struggle to cope. I need to be actively aware  as #SAD starts to take hold or I can quickly find myself in a rut.This year it started with fatigue, feeling jaded and I thought I was coming down with something. My motivation took a hit and although I knew I needed to get out the house and get a change of scenery coupled with some exercise. Getting a foot over the threshold of the door wasn't as easy as it sounds. Anyone who suffers from this will understand it's not easy and can quickly lead to depression if not combated. So here is my advice. - Organisation is key - Take Vitamin D and vitamin C supplementation - Stay well hydrated - Get enough sleep otherwise fatigue will exacerbate your situation - Make plans but involve others. So you have to get out and meet someone or you are inviting someone over - Exercise in a way you enjoy. Gym, yoga, exercise class,  walk, run,  cycle etc  and if you can, again organise this activity with someone then this will help and make you accountable to another. I do hope this helps some of you Don't forget that you are powerful Ps  if someone could start a go fund me page so I could live abroad for 4 months per year to skip winter that would be lovely ☺️ #sleep #seasonalaffectivedisorder #motivation #change #help #exercise #organised

🛰️ O segundo estado que mais destruiu a Amazônia em setembro foi o #Amazonas, com 193 km² (17%). Em solo amazonense, a destruição avança pelo Sul, onde há forte pressão de grileiros. Apenas dois municípios dessa região, Lábrea e Boca do Acre, somaram 38% do total desmatado no estado.🔍 Informar sobre o que está acontecendo em cada estado da Amazônia é muito importante para que a população local possa pressionar por medidas mais efetivas de combate ao desmatamento. O Amazonas pode ganhar muito com a floresta em pé, principalmente por meio do mercado de carbono e da bioeconomia.

👉BreatheSlow, deep breaths can help lower blood pressure and heart rate. Try pranayama breathing, a yogic method that involves breathing through one nostril at a time to relieve anxiety.

Changing of the seasons…….It is getting to that time of year when the nights are longer, the days are shorter and the weather is colder and wetter. It’s amazing how the changing of the seasons can affect our mood and just our general feelings of well-being.When the weather is good and the days are longer it is easy to spend time outdoors and make the most of the weather, whether its sitting at home in the garden, going for a walk or even sitting outside having a meal with friends.However, when the clocks go back it is so much harder and many people (myself included) can find it only too easy to make excuses not to leave the sofa. The problem with that is, that your world can become very small and consist of only leaving the house to go to work and sitting on front of the TV. In fact with hybrid working being so prevalent these days, you are probably getting less interaction with people than ever before and even for an introvert like me I know that’s not healthy, as humans are sociable creatures.The other problem with not going anywhere and just staring at the TV is that if you are struggling with anything, whether it is anxiety, depression, stress, grief, low self-esteem etc it makes it worse if you overthink it.So, I guess my message is even though you may not feel like it, try and make that effort to get out of the house occasionally. Accept that invitation to go and meet some friends or even put your wellies on and go and splash in some puddles like you did when you were a child. Remember there is a big world out there – make the most of it.#sad #autumn #rain #winter #anxiety #depression #sociable #lowmood #anxiety

Alright, let’s take a moment to reflect. At work are you becoming increasingly tired? Having trouble focusing of staying motivated? Have you been abnormally irritated, short or dismissive of others? Lacking progress or losing direction with projects? If so, you may be feeling some of the early signs of burnout. Occupational burnout is a type of work related stress which induces a state of physical and/or emotional exhaustion often accompanied by a sense of reduced accomplishment and loss of identify. Burnout is not an acute stress and instead a more gradual decline as described by the five stages: 1) Honeymoon 2) Onset of Stress Phase 3) Chronic Stress Phase 4) Burnout Phase 5) Habitual Burnout Phase. According to a recent @deloitte survey, upwards of 77% of US based professionals report having experienced burnout on at least one occasion. 70% of employees indicate their companies are not doing enough to prevent burnout, while 21% indicate receiving no support programs or wellness initiatives (“Workplace Burnout Survey”, 2022). Burnout is recognized as a syndrome and associated with mild to moderate psychological and emotional disregulation, observed first in changes in thought, mood and behavioral patterns. Overtime, if unmitigated the condition can worsen and cause symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorder and select personality disorders. According to @MindTools, utilize the following 6 strategies to defeat burnout: 1) work with a purpose 2) perform a job analysis 3) give to others 4) take control 5) exercise regularly 6) learn to manage stress Expand your awareness and recognize the signs, become reflective and intentional to avoid burnout and achieve work place satisfaction. You deserve to be happy, engaged and inspired no matter what stage of your career.Learn moreET-Therapy.com......#socialworker #explorepage #mood #thought #emotion #selfcare #wellness #socialwork #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmatters #counseling #lifechanges #happy #depression #anxiety #health #transition #relationship #counseling #sad #psychology #psychotherapist #therapy #meditation #unknown #mindfulness #breathwork #yoga

दुसरो की मजबूरी का उतना भी फायदा नही उठाना चाहिए कि हद ही पार हो जाए। जब आप किसी जगह काम कर रहे तो उसका उतना भी शोषण नही कर लेना चाहिए कि खुद पछताने के लिए कुछ न बचे। कुछ दिन पहले मेरा एक दोस्त  एक कंपनी में नौकरी करने गया जब नौकरी पक्की हो गयी । तो उन्होंने  बोला कि पहले कुछ दिन काम सिख लो फिर ऑफर लेटर देंगे। जब उसने एक सप्ताह सिख लिया फिर फोन किया तो बोल रहे कि एक महीने काम करके सिख लो फिर ऑफर लेटर देंगे। पता नही लोग कितना मजबूरी का फायदा उठाएंगे  ट्रेनिंग तो सभी जगह मिलती है लेकिन उसका ये मतलब नही न कि हम बिना ऑफर लेटर बिना किसी पैसे के उनके काम को शिख ले फिर वह ऑफर लेटर देंगे और काम का पैसा। इतना भी मजबूरी का फायदा न उठाए क्योकि आज हमारी तो कल आपकी बारी है। ट्रेनिंग तो सभी कंपनी देती है लेकिन वह पहले ऑफर लेटर देती है उसके बाद ट्रेनिंग देती है लेकिन लोग आज कल इतना निचे गिर जाएंगे, इतना मजबूरी का फायदा उठाएंगे। इतनी उम्मीद नही होती। कल आप भी हमारी जगह होंगे हम यहाँ नही तो कही और काम कर लेंगे लेकिन इस तरह की मजबूरी का फायदा उठाना सही नही। 🥲🥲🥲#story #job #sad #moodoff #corporate #bankingjobs #financejob

Lying in hospital, I realised…Endings and beginnings. You can't have one without the other.My right leg suffered pain for what felt like an eternity. The pain was really excruciating  whenever I walked for long periods of time or in the cold.In July 2017 my leg started to swell and this never happened before. After months of consultations with doctors (NHS and Private), they finally found the problem by this time my leg has tripled in size.I was told by doctors they needed to operate as soon as possible and the dates they had were in December.The problem with these dates is that our son, could anytime late December and I wanted to be there for the birth.December 26 2017, our son Jeevan was born. I never felt such happiness before in my life. He was already teaching me great lessons and gave new meaning to terms such as love, care, laughter, joy, tears, etc.Then suddenly, the pain kicked back in my leg. It was almost as if the pain was trying to tell me something.You see, I had battled with the pain for so long that I became numb to it, which was not a good sign.Think about it, how many times have you been hurt or felt pain and somehow become somewhat numb to that pain?The lessons my pain taught me was this;“Pain may not be a pleasurable experience itself, but it builds our pleasure in ways that pleasure alone simply cannot achieve.”Without this pain, I would never have pushed myself to become fitter, health and stronger for myself, my son and family.I came out of surgery with a smile on my face, even though I could feel pain. I was even told that I would be on crutches for minimum three month, instead I stopped using them after two months.Why? because I let my mind heal my body through the knowing what is waiting for me on the other side.What’s ONE tip you’d share about your experience with pain?

According to research by Thriveworks, seasonal depression is expected to reach its peak this week (the first week of November). 2022’s search trends are tracking 30.17% higher than last year's 2021. Although we know that everyone experiencing SAD won't necessarily contact a mental health professional, there is a greater chance that they WILL go to a PCP office for one reason or another (cold, flu, injury, annual physical, etc). Ideally, universal screening for depression would increase the likelihood that those dealing with SAD would be identified and treated. #depressionscreening #depression #anxiety #anxietyscreening #GAD #MDD #PPD #postpartum #postpartumdepression #panicdisorder #socialanxietydisorder #socialanxiety #OCD #obsessivecompulsivedisorder #screeningsaves #accessgranted #integratedcare #collaborativecare #primarycare #mentalhealthcare #behavioralhealth #behavioralhealthcare #digitalhealth #healthtech #seasonsalaffectivedisorder #SAD

Aaron Carter passed away at the age of 34 on Saturday 💔 I grew up when he just started his career with Nick Carter. I remember my sister and I were singing and dancing, listening to his songs: "I Want Candy" and "Aaron's Party" a lot. He was also on Disney Television Studios's Lizzie McGuire as a guest. He was battling an addiction and mental issues, and he said on the news he was sober for five years. I do not know the reasons for his death but this is a devastating news for everyone, especially for his family and friends. My condolences for his love ones. You will always be remembered by your love ones including all your fans. I hope his soul rests in peace😢❤️The New York Times article explains about this sad news 👉https://lnkd.in/gHuDT8JK#aaroncarter #nickcarter #thenewyorktimes #sad #breakingnews

OK, so who managed to enjoy an extra hour of sleep this past weekend as we turned the clocks back by an hour at the end of BST?Experts believe that changing the clocks could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes and possibly even cause a surge in the number of car accidents – have you ever seen data to prove this?The effects are only temporary, a bit like jet lag, but because turning the clocks back can disrupt our circadian rhythm and, in turn, our sleep, bad moods, appetite changes, and even depression are possible side effects of changing the clocks.In particular, the change of clocks is thought to be one of the causes of SAD (seasonal affective disorder). The symptoms of SAD are very similar to depression, including a persistent low mood and difficulty concentrating.So, while the extra hour of sleep feels like a bonus, changing the clocks has a surprising effect on our bodies and our mindset. For me, it was a little discombobulating, and I hadn’t quite noticed it as much before as I did last year, so this year I tried something a little tactical to manage the event.I consciously eased in changes over 3 days – Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I shifted bedtime and waking time by just 20 minutes each day, I shifted mealtimes, and working hours, and my favourite one, I made really sure that I got 2 hours of sun on my face each day (melatonin regulation).I’m not usually very disciplined with any of those habits, but it was an interesting experiment for me, and felt good to be conscious of what was happening to my mind and body.#circadianrhythm #coaches #coaching #SAD #depression #bst #bodyclock
