The recent loss of my father has been the most difficult, life altering experience that I’ve ever had the misfortune of experiencing. The emptiness that is left by the death of someone so intrinsically tied to the human being that I am…words will always fall far too short to describe. The loss is palpable. There is no “business as usual”. Nothing is “as usual” in this kind of grief. My thoughts..hopes, and dreams aren’t even “as usual” anymore. The only option is to push on; wounded. Carolyn Christie’s words give power to the true rawness of grief in such a poignant way. My thoughts are with anyone who is trying their hardest to honor their authentic weaknesses while still remaining strong for others. Life is hard but it’s oh so prescious!#loss #griefsupport #bereavement

Everyone experiences grief differently. Organizations, and especially immediate supervisors, must meet grieving employees where they are in their unique circumstances. This is challenging to do well. If you've experienced loss, what did you benefit from or need from your employer or direct supervisor?#hr #grief #people #peopledevelopment #everythingisaboutpeople #culture #developingmanagers

We are going to mix it up a bit!Episode 27 of "Getting in your Business" with Coach Sandra, with returning guest, the wonderful Anna Duncan🪩 !We don't have a set agenda per se, but we do want to address some serious topics surrounding grief and loss. We are both quite experienced in facing loss and we think it should be talked about openly and want to shed light on the types of loss and that grief is an individual experience. It might take up the entire time, but it might not! Let's see what happens!#business #linkedinlive #community #connection #grief #support

Three years ago today, my sweet nephew Henry passed away from a rare genetic disorder called #PCH (Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia). He was 10 months old. And here’s what Henry, my brother and my sister-in-law (Henry’s mom and dad) taught me:•Say his name.•Talk about him.•Grief doesn’t look any one particular way — and it’s the “right way” however it shows up.•Once a parent, always a parent, even if your child isn’t here. •Create rituals that honor the person you loved. And those rituals can be serious or silly and everything in between.What Henry taught me in his 10 short months will last many, many lifetimes. #grief #infantloss #raredisease #deathanddying #emotionalintelligence

On Monday I had massive FOMO at missing the wonderful Nilema Bhakta-Jones's event Courageous Leaders Event. I wasn’t there in part because it was the first anniversary of losing my greatest most Courageous Leader, my maternal grandfather, affectionately/respectfully referred to throughout the family as “Dadji”. There’s been a lot going on recently in terms of work and legal events (guys, we need to spread them out across the year!!). I knew I needed to create some space on this first anniversary.  As it was, I wasn’t overly affected on the day, but the grief has been creeping up in the days since.  My grandfather lived a principled life of service and sacrifice. He originally wanted to live a life serving humanity, but then dedicated all his focus to his family, came to the UK and worked several jobs at a time, happy in the fruits of our successes. He taught us all so much by his example, by his stories and by his wisdom. I'll never live up to his ideal, but aspire to offer the world what I learned from him: mostly the joy that he derived from everyone he engaged with, the 100% presence he gave to others and the constant desire to help, support and make people happy. As I sit with my grief, I breathe deeply with the appreciation, love and gratitude I have for him and especially that he had such strong and deep relationships with my boys and his other great grandchildren. We're all so lucky to have had him and wish him endless love and peace. For all others out there experiencing grief, which is a constantly revisiting teacher, this one is for you (and me..) #grief #gratitude #courageousleadership

Vulnerability alert!What would have been my mom's 62nd birthday was yesterday... It was a hard day... She passed away in May of 2020 after a 3 year fist fight with cancer... Yesterday, I wasn't my best self for my family, my co-workers, or myself. But I think that, as leaders and as human beings, we have to remember that vulnerability and sadness are normal parts of life. They don't indicate weakness or that you "can't handle yourself" unless you let them overtake you - and I promise that if you try and bottle up these feelings, that's exactly what they will do. It's OK to have hard days, even as leaders. It's OK to let people know what's going on and open yourself up to help. Yes, it's also very important to not allow these feelings to overwhelm you or your life, but it's OK to grieve and to take a minute. We all have hard days. Give yourself, and others grace for these days. I wrote this article, not as a "feel sorry for me" thing, but to give someone hope who is dealing with loss. Time is the great healer, and with time comes clarity, hope, and progress. The days of grief after a loss become less and less impactful and amazing memories begin to come back. Trust me, I know first hand! Take care of yourself and each other. #people #help #leaders #loss #grief #itsokaynottobeokay

I was one of those people whose parent passed in 2020 Covid and I wasn’t able to get to the funeral and watched it online instead.Awful 😢 My mum didn’t cope very well with my dad passing and that’s how I ended up back in Melbs but then got stuck in the 2021 lockdown.In February 2022 my mum was diagnosed with cancer and passed in April. I just found out 3 days before I started a new job.My weekends have been hectic for most of the year. It was a big funeral, filled with funny and loving and sad memories of both my parents.And then, the arduous task of packing up our family home that my dad built in the 60’s. And managing the nitty gritty of the estate. The paperwork is still not 100% finalised, it’s a huge piece.It’s been a difficult few years on top of a difficult period.As vulnerable as this post is I felt it important to share with my professional community.Why?Because life happens all the time.People are dealing with things all the time, that you don’t even know about.Kindness is not very hard but can go a long way ♥️People are going through stuff all the time.If you haven’t heard from someone, there might just be a really good reason.Mental health is crucial to nurture. I’m definitely feeling a lot better but it’s taken a lot of work and sometimes it’s just been important to allow myself to grieve.If you’ve lost a parent, no matter what the circumstances my heart ♥️ is with you.If you missed a funeral due to Covid or saying goodbye, my heart 💜 is with yours. Love Kirsty xx——-Sharing a great photo of my parents when they got engaged, that hair!!!#grief #mentalhealth #kindnessmatters

✨For a long time I thought, "I haven't lost a parent or someone close, so I don't know grief." Turns out, I was kidding myself.✨Grief does not just arise at the loss of a loved one. We experience grief and loss on an almost constant basis throughout our lives - moving house/city/state/country, changing schools, a new job, shifting friendships, relationships that end or change, injuries, rejections.  So why do we pretend grief doesn't affect us - and how does this hurt us, in the workplace and beyond? Grief and loss are natural human emotions - and this conversation with Professor George Kohlrieser changed the way I think about them both. The lessons, and even the wisdom they hold.Listen to the latest episode of the We Are Human Leaders podcast and let me know: What's your biggest takeaway?

Grief made me brave. It encouraged me to face my mortality. Grief made me soft:It broke me open and smoothed out my edges.Grief made me go inward:It inspired a new level of introspection.Grief made me walk away:From people, places, and situations that drained me. Grief made me take care of myself:I am worth it, and I am here. Grief made me remember: That life was mine to create.Your grief may be the source of your pain,But it can also be the elixir to it. I can show you how. #grief #lifecoach #healing #clients #emotionalintelligence #emotionalhealth

I hope everyone is having a great Friday!Except for Elon Musk - I hope you step on a lego barefoot. 👿 For everyone at Twitter (and anyone else experiencing layoffs/toxic work cultures), I see you and am sending you all the healing and positive vibes.  🙏 While we often say we are more than our jobs and we shouldn't wrap our identities up with our work - it can be hard not to when we are so passionate about what we do and who we work with.Take this time to grieve the loss of your job, what you had hoped the job would be, what it could have been, and what you could have done there. ...And then celebrate the fact you don't have to put up with any more of their f*cking bullshit and now you are free to go somewhere you are actually valued!!!xoxo#grief #personaldevelopment #womenleaders #layoffs

A few weeks ago I lost my grandmother. (We were extremely close)The grief didn’t hit me at first, but shortly after returning to work, it came on like a tornado.My work started to suffer. I felt like I was letting everyone down. I convinced myself that I could do this on my own, but truthfully I was drowning.After a particularly rough weekend, I came in Monday expecting the worst. Instead, I was met with compassion and understanding. The reason I love working at Zego is I’m seen as a human. I go through real things. I have real emotions. I am allowed to feel.My manager assured me we would get through it. He has my back. After this week, I feel more confident than ever that I’m doing a great job. I’m valued. I’m accepted. I’m important. I’m Kade.It is my dream to see more companies treat their employees as humans going through real things. I’m grateful I’ve found a company that embraces this philosophy entirely!#grief #gratitude #dreamteam #imissyougrandma

Being a grief coach sadly doesn’t make you immune from the often brutal journey of grief.Having lost my own father about 19 months ago to Covid I was well aware that my fitness needed to be higher on my priority list. Mental health is also something that is affected during times of loss and healing and it’s sometimes easier to busy ourselves with work, the practicalities of a bereavement and staying within our comfort zones.As one of my mentors taught me ‘Emotion Needs Motion’So as a way of honouring my beautiful Dad & my mental & physical health I have embarked on a 12k daily step challenge to raise funds for @thementalhealthfoundationMy wonderful friend Emma Clayton is joining me in honour of her journey with grief and her wonderful Dad.During times of loss some naturally run from or toward their grief. No judgement either way - we all deal with grief differently.I’d love to know what you found helpful whilst navigating the terrain of grief?  Or even what you wish had been there by way of support, especially in the workplace.# #mentalhealth #grief A picture of my Dad and I during one of our last holidays together in India

Nissa has some beautiful words to share that was 💯 important on week one as it is today at week 4…(post downsizing)As the weeks tick on, you may find that the sorrow increases- despair sets in- the fight has left the building- the connections you had at your previous role gets a bit quieter…As you sit in your own personal reality- how will you continue to care for yourself?  Can the suggestions shared from week one be just as valuable as week 4 (or 5,6,7, etc.)?YES!!!What are you doing today (whatever day you may be reading this) to lean into self-care, connection, and readjust during this time of transition?Thank you Nissa for these words of inspiration ❤️

Trigger warning: suicide, loss.It’s been 2 years since my Hong Kong grandpa left us: he lost the will to live. People close to me will know how life shattering it was.I’ve often felt like I don’t have the ‘right’ to grieve this hard, this long. That I should have ‘moved on’ by now.To an extent, the length of time we spent together and our shared experiences doesn’t matter. The bottom line is he was the rock of my life and someone who I loved dearly – who then chose to leave. And then there’s the cultural stigma of losing someone (particularly an elder!) this way. And how it shocked my Christian faith to its core, particularly the belief that love – especially God’s love – can overcome darkness. If you are going through a devastating loss of any kind right now, this is your reminder to be kind to yourself. Grief is not linear: it is messy, painful and you can’t put a timeline on it or expectations for how you should / should not feel. And know that you are not alone. Apart from friends & family, I would really encourage you to seek support from your manager & workplace. Whether it’s bereavement leave, flexible working, an Employee Assistance Programme or simply for someone to acknowledge that you’re not okay and can log off early for the day – it’s only when we are open (a bit) about our grief can colleagues make adjustments and support our mental health at work.#grief #suicide #mentalhealth #loss #bereavement

Lately, grief feels like an anchor attached to me. I think it's the holidays approaching, my upcoming birthday, and the first anniversary of Dad passing all feeling so heavy. I was so frustrated when it first crept back in, but today I am giving myself grace. Grief is a journey, it's not linear, and it's all ok. Permit yourself to process; that's what I am doing. Hugs and prayers for those of you feeling this. #permissiontoprocess #grief #runningonfaith #wellbeing

Grief Relief!Grief is that strong, sometimes overwhelming emotion for us – especially in the sadness of losing a loved one. It is common for grief to last a year or longer. We must resolve the emotional and life changes. Usually, the pain becomes less intense over time.Depression is usually the longest and most difficult stage of grief. Many experts say what brings us out of depression is finally allowing ourselves to experience our very deepest sadness. We come to the place where we accept the loss, make some meaning in our loves and are able to move forward.When someone is going through grief, there are ways to give them support:1.      Be a good listener2.      Respect the person’s way of grieving3.      Accept mood swings4.      Avoid giving advice5.      Refrain from trying to explain the loss6.      Help out with practical tasks7.      Stay connected and available8.      Offer words that touch the heartIf we experience love, we also will experience grief. What are some of your helpful hints for people experiencing grief?#grief #griefsupport #depressionawareness #depressionhelp #marthashands #remembering #allsoulsday

Please turn the sound up for this video!For those of us who are experiencing grief, loss of a loved one or any other kind of loss or heartbreak at the moment this is from my heart to yours!This person for me is my dad 9 months ago. Grief is a rollercoaster of emotions. It is OK for us all to feel them fully. We must allow ourselves space to just sit still and be with our emotions and process before we can begin moving through them.Some days are easier than others. Sometimes grief pops up out of nowhere. Just know that this is all a part of the process. The process of loving someone with our whole heart.Let’s ask ourselves if this person we adored and loved so much was still alive…….What would their advice be on how to fully live the rest of our lives? What would they want us to know? What would they want us to free ourselves from? Let’s all live the rest of our lives the way that our loved one’s wish that they could’ve & the way that they would genuinely want us to!Life is short and life is now. Tomorrow is not guaranteed.So much love and hugs to all of you!There is and will be brighter days.Know that we are all in this together.  #averysunshine #sunshinemindset #grief #loss #socialanxiety #selectivemutism #ownyourvoice #shineyourlight #choosetoshine #showuptoshine

Some may disagree that this is "LinkedIn appropriate", which is fine. In some organization cultures, the expectation is to leave personal life at the door when you step into the workplace. I think that's such an outdated and ineffective mindset, especially if someone is dealing with the loss of a loved one. With that in mind, I wanted to share this tik tok post that changed my outlook on grieving. Many of us have to figure out how to continue moving forward when a piece of our heart is no longer with us. Grieving on the offensive may add a little relief when things get tough. #AndyGrammer #Grief #Kindness

That goes for every space, online and off, including our workplaces.#Opportunity #WorkCulture #Grief #Community

When I read this story, it made me cry then feel incredibly hopeful. If you have lost someone close to you (and who hasn't), this book helps understand why we cannot shake that feeling of loss, even years later. Patti has a way of reassuring you while you walk through her experience of losing her best friend at age 14. For those who struggle to talk about grief, reading this book may give you another outlet.#grieving#grievingjourney#grievingprocess#books

A client reached out, feeling unsure about how to talk to a friend/colleague whose friend had just died. Talking about death and dying is uncomfortable for most people, so we tend to cope with getting lost in discussions about how unfair the death was, who is to blame, what has been robbed with future would-be scenarios — or we get into cheerleader overdrive and want to point out how good they still have it, how much for which there is to be grateful, or worse, impose our religious views on what happens after death (that may not be their views).Neither of those routes are very helpful. As an ordained interfaith minister, here are my two main invitations for situations like this: 1. Ask your friend/colleague to tell stories about their friend. Encourage them to honor their lives and legacy by talking about them. 2. Nothing you can say can take their loss away. Just being there with them as they grieve, cry as they reminisce, is all you need to do. Just be there. Don’t fix. Just be there. The biggest invitation from death is to live our lives fully - with kindness, patience and understanding. This is the gift to all of us. 💜#grief #griefsupport #death #conversations #innerbusiness

My son, Isaac, died 14 years ago today.He was 3 days old and the twin to my daughter, Lily.I don't tell you this to garner sympathy or create sadness.I share this because I believe that we should be able to talk about those we loved and lost and to share our grief stories.Grief should not be considered something that we hide from others, just because it can be uncomfortable to talk about and make both ourselves and others feel vulnerable.Everyone experiences grief in one way or another throughout their lifetime. If anything, it is the one thing we all have in common.And it changes us, whether we want it to or not.We are never the same after grief - nor should we be.Like every experience we have in life, we are changed by these experiences and grow from them.It's the same with grief.Grief lives inside of us and becomes a part of who we are now.It is how we choose to face it and incorporate it into our lives that determines what our future looks like.It takes courage and a desire to move forward.And it is hard as hell to do.It is lonely work.It is emotionally draining.And only we can choose our path forward.For me, I would not be where I am today if I had not lost Isaac. His loss catapulted me into the world of grief where I learned that there is so much the world doesn't know nor talk about when it comes to grief.Now, I work to educate people about grief and to support those women going through it (no matter their loss), helping them to figure out who they are now and who they want to be through 1:1 coaching or within my "Becoming an Empowered Grief Warrior" workshops.Grief is a journey with lots of ups and downs along the way and is one that is easier when you have someone by your side - if only to sit silently beside you.For anyone who is grieving, know that you are not alone. And if you are looking for support in figuring out how to move forward, please reach out. I am here to help.I love my son dearly and think of him every day. He is part of me and I wouldn't have it any other way.#evolvcoaching #grief #loss #lifecoach #lifecoaching #griefcoach #movingforwardaftergrief

Human emotions are, mostly, not welcome at work. Especially the 'BIG' ones like grief.Most of my professional career I've been dealing with grief in different forms, I just didn't have the language to label it.From loosing family members, quitting jobs, changing careers, ending a significant relationship, moving overseas, moving back again... all of these signified the end of something in my life, all brought me grief.Something that, until recently, I've been awful at doing is recognising and 'just being' in my emotions - especially grief.Emotions hurt, like, A LOT. And, mostly they felt unproductive when I had so much work to do, meetings to attend, clients to see - to be a hot wreck of emotions simply wasn't an option. So I ignored my grief.Eventually though, these things catch up with you and in recent years recognising and being with my grief in it's entirety has been my hardest inner work.What I've noticed, depsite how awful going headlong into the grief felt at first, once I started putting all that baggage down, I felt lighter.I'm able to connect with others better, because I'm more self-commpassionate to myself and to them, too. I'm also able to truly be in gratitude and happiness when I experience it - my emotional range is far richer.What I wish I'd had the skills to do earlier is recognise grief, and create space for those around me to experience their grief too.Recently Sally and I had the opportunity to speak with George Kohlrieser on We Are Human Leaders about grief. This was possibly our most profound and heart-expanding conversation to date.We aren't alone in our grief. YOU aren't alone in your grief. Let's get better at supporting one another at home and work to experience this deeply profound human emotion with grace.Please be courageous and share with me below, how do you feel we need to be handling grief and loss in the workplace?#grief #griefandloss #workplacegrief #mentalhealth #depression #emotionsatwork #humanleadership #wearehumanleaders

My first child died in the NICU almost 8 years ago, and to say that he shaped the person I am today is an understatement. My experience with my son, both inside and after the NICU, has forever changed me.While sitting in the NICU, kangarooing my first born, my love and passion for helping medically fragile patients like my son grew, shaping my career to re-focus on medical innovation. My experience has guided how I approach the medical technology industry in my professional life. At the end of the day, it is the people (e.g., #patients, #caregivers, #families, #clinicians) who need to be at the center of focus; they are the ones in need of new medical technologies and innovations during some of the most challenging times of their lives.When my son passed away in my arms, I sought out help to process my grief. One of the most helpful resources I leveraged was through Hand To Hold, an incredible non-profit that focuses on supporting NICU families.Today, I temporarily take off my medtech innovation hat to focus on my #NICU and #bereaved parent experience. I will be joining Hand to Hold as a panelist and moderator at their 2022 NICU Community Conference, the only conference of its kind that brings together NICU parents and NICU clinicians. I'll be sharing the virtual stage with Mary-Frances O'Connor and Lisa Keefauver, MSW for the panel "Grieving is a Part of Every NICU Experience" at 12:15-1:15pm Central (1:15-2:15pm Eastern).This 3-day conference is free to attend and includes continuing education credits. If you work in the NICU, have lived through a NICU experience, or simply want to support NICU families, I encourage you to attend and/or check out the amazing support that Hand To Hold provides.#H2HNICUconf #NICU #nicusupport #grief #bereavement #bereavementsupport #infantlossawareness #infantloss #patientsfirst

Did you know that research suggests that nearly 1 in 6 kids will grieve the death of at least one significant person – parent, sibling, relative, classmate, teacher, or friend – by the age of 18?Research shows that bereaved children are at an increased risk of disrupted development. Unaddressed childhood grief and trauma can lead to short- and long-term difficulties including decreased academic performance, mental health issues, and early mortality. Grateful to be a part of the mission and vision of Annie’s Hope to walk with kids and their families as they heal!#childrensgriefawarenessmonth #grief #mentalhealth

Great article for any parent having to deal with their child/ children’s grief. One of the hardest things ever! Much of what has been written is as true for adults unfortunately. Grief is the one thing we never really overcome ; with time we learn to deal with it but we are not over it .#grief #loss #childrensmentalhealth

My experience over the last three months has taught me many things, far too many to mention here, but balance and people are the biggest.For the first time in 12 years since owning Cloud9, I wasn't able to put it first.Giving birth to my second son was not even a distraction.But on 25th July 2022 my world turned upside down and will never be the same again.I lost my big sister Julie.It was sudden and very unexpected and shook us all to the core.It taught me that although in business I am very resilient, when it comes to my family I am very different.From the few that knew, I have received the most amazing support. You know who you are, and I will always be grateful to you for your compassion and care.I talk all of the time of the importance of a solid business network, who provide you with continuous courage, motivation, strategy, support, a sounding board and much much more, but you never know when you will really need it, and how valuable it is to know people truly have your back.Julie was a fun loving girl who loved to support local charities, such as animal rescue, the homeless, Essex Air Ambulance and St Helena Hospice. We have done many fundraising events together.I will never forgot walking around the streets of London for 26.2 miles in our bras, I can laugh now but we were not laughing at the time!When I saw this event for St Helena Hospice, I knew it would of been one that we did together so I had to get involved.I know that when I step on the hot coals next week, Julie will be right there with me.I am sharing this as I know that vulnerability is not my friend, (but I need to let it be) as a thank you to those who have given me support and helped me find balance, and finally as an opportunity for you to join me in supporting this amazing charity.Julie and I are most grateful.#grief #vulnerability #charity #firewalk #sthelenahospice #thankyou

The huddled figure sat shivering in the wet and grey autumnal night by the shop window.  A drenched sleeping bag he managed to scavenge the previous day was his only source of comfort."You ok?" asked a familiar voice.His grey and ashen face looked up through saddened and dark eyes as he replied, "I'm tired.""I know that feeling, my friend," came the sullen response, "May I sit with you?" he continued."If you like, I could use the company," he stated hesitantly.They both sat silently as the rain poured down, "Mind if I smoke," said the man, taking his tobacco out of his pocket."Go ahead.  Do you have one spare?" he responded.Sparking it up, he took a few deep inhales before saying, "How did you end up like this?""In truth, I was here the day I was born.  I never wanted to live.  I have carried grief with me every waking day.  No matter what I do, it's there, it just doesn't go away, and I'm tired, tired of this weight." he declared with a heavy tone in his voice."I know that feeling. I know it well.  How do you explain you just want to die?  How do you explain that you have bled enough?" he spoke placing his hand on the person's shoulder.The man looked at him with a look that conveyed a deep understanding and compassion.  "Today is my final day," he uttered, handing him an empty bottle of pills."Why, why would you do this? I won't let you!" he screamed at the man.  "You are stronger than this!" he angrily decreed."It's too late, you are too late,"  he answered as a serene look overtook his face."I can get you to a hospital they can save you, I won't let you do this!!!" he continued to argue."It's too late, you could have stopped me but you didn't," came the reply."Why," he stated in frustration."Because I am you," he remarked as he drifted, shivering into the darkness."The End" by Raven Black.In the memorandum of those that could not carry it one more day.  May you rest in peace.#shortstories #sadness #creativewriting #suicideprevention #grief

After the loss of your spouse, there are so many things to navigate and manage that it can be overwhelming. It’s likely that you’ll know people who want to help but don’t know how, and you may not know how to help them help you! By creating a Personal Board of Directors, you can assign precise roles to those wondering what they can do, including your “Chief of Staff” and your co-workers, family members and friends. My Widow Board of Directors worksheet will help you assign and onboard your personal support team.

Grief is everywhere right now. Humans losing humans, pets, jobs, and other things that matter.Grief makes it hard to show up for yourself, much less keep up a "brave front" for those around you.Give space for grief, be it in yourself or others. It is so incredibly hard and you may feel like you lose yourself for a while. That's ok. Talk about it. Share. Cry. Laugh. The more we talk about it, the more we can all heal. #grief #kindness #empathy

In the spirit of Gratitude:In a year for me that has been filled with losses, it is important that I count my blessings. Honestly, looking back at the beginning of this year, I had a deep sense that it would not be a good year for you. I had no idea where that feeling was coming from because I am generally an optimistic person. My sense was proven right. It started with getting retrenched as a result of our country’s governance systems that resulted in our entire head-office folding over. That was a huge knock because it happened so unexpectedly. An external force knocked us all off our feet. The second loss would seriously knock me out for the count and leave me completely defeated. That was the loss of my mother and my kids maternal and paternal grandmothers in the space of one week. My world turned very dark!In subsequent months I received a lot of support, love, and encouragement from my tribe. And that is what I am grateful for. I was deeply touched by the concern and overflowing care that I received from my friends and family. When I shared my astonishment with my friend, he said, but why are you surprised because this means that you planted a lot of seeds of love and support & now you are reaping the rewards! I am therefore so grateful for the rule of reciprocity, and I have learnt that not only do you receive when give, but you receive way more that you have given.I am also grateful that during this time I was able to mourn all my losses without the pressures of fulltime employment. The gift of having the time to grieve fully is a precious one that not everyone gets to enjoy. That being said, please reach out should you or your organisation need a dynamic, experienced leader in account management and business development.Please share what you are most grateful for in 2022. #gratefulness #gratitude #grief #loss #love #support

“Is it okay to connect to our loved ones from the other side?How can I connect to my loved ones who left me recently?”These are questions I am often asked.Many people miss their loved ones who have left this world and they want to connect to them, to communicate with them. To feel their presence and hence they find the best way to go about it and that’s to find a medium and get connected.I do understand the pain of losing loved ones. I do understand the void it leaves when they are gone. I also know that many people ( myself included) are able to connect you with them.But the question is should this be practiced ?Watch this video to know my answer. May all departed souls rest in peace🙏🏻#mediumship#SaharGharachorlou#medium#channeling#clairvoyance#TheGift#peace#lifeafterdeath#grief#lifecoach#metaphysical#Therapist#twiceborn#becausetimedoesnotheal

#grief  is a complicated process. Every individual experiences it differently.

ABOUT JENETTA
Jenetta Barry is a Mental Health Support Specialist, corporate trainer and personal-development coach, who works through both on-line consultations as well as face-to-face consultations in Harley Street London. Due to personal tragedy/loss Jenetta has dedicated her work to healing her life, having walked the walk and talked the talk. This led her to find the basics and expand her work further through the formation of The Epiphany Process. Jenetta also certifies life coaches in her signature process for applying accurate mental techniques in one's daily life. While Jenetta has been associated with several headline cases, she is equally inspired to share her “mental health toolkit” with organisations and individuals who use them to overcome everyday challenges.

The Epiphany Process’ charity arm - World Jenny’s Day was created from the realisation Jenetta's daughter, Jenny, had died on World Mental Health Day - 10 October.  World Jenny’s Day is now held annually using theatre and the arts to normalise and soften conversations around suicide and depression and their solutions and to also celebrate Mental Health Wellness. Jenetta is also a published author (Full-Circle Rainbow) as well as having had her life-defining story published and featured alongside Dr. Bernie Siegel, Dr. Michael Beckwith (The Secret) , Dr. John Demartini (The Secret) and Dr. Alveda King (Martin Luther King’s niece).

Today Mexicans and other Latin Americans celebrate the #dayofthedead or #diadelosmuertos It's a beautiful tradition, they honor the dead annually by creating altars and offerings with their favorite things.Regardless of your beliefs, I think this is a lovely way to embrace #grief and understand that even though the dead are gone they always leave something in you, which is enough to commemorate them. Today I'm thinking of my mom and all the wonderful things she left in me, even though she is no longer with us. If you want to learn more about this celebration click on the link below.

Today my daughter found a feather right after she made an important decision. She was so happy, knowing spirit was sending a sign she was moving in the right direction. I just saw this poem tonight. May anyone grieving the loss of a loved one know how present they still are. 💙🙏FEATHERSI sent you a little white featherI placed it right there in your way I wrapped it in love with a messageto let you know you’ll be okayI drew you a colourful rainbowIt followed your car for a while I made a spectacular rainbow I hoped it would show me your smileI flew down a beautiful robin It landed right there on your ledge I prayed he would give you the strength to push yourself back from the edgeI try every day to remind you that I never did go away the feathers, the rainbows, the robins are my way of trying to stay.🪶🌈 🕊Donna AshworthFrom ‘LOSS’; poems to better weather the many waves of grief.

In ICRC’s #MHPSS, we accompany People affected by Violence and Families of the Missing through the grief or ambiguous loss they may experience when losing a loved one. Among other types of psychosocial and psychological support, we accompany them during Specific Moments such as the search, identification and collection of human remains in dignity because of their Right to Know, as well as during Memorialization and commemoration community and group actions. In coherence with the ICRC mission to prevent and alleviate (more) human suffering, these actions provide acknowledgment of what happened, meaning, give a sense of continuity and promote group and community cohesion.#familiesofthemissing #mentalhealth #publichealth #righttoknow #ambiguousloss #grief #community #memorialization #mhpss #needtoremember

This is such an important topic - Children's Grief Awareness Day. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to share this pdf. During this Pandemic so many people have endured so grief, children have as well. Share this with others you know, Inform yourself, share with your child's school. Most people believe that talking about death and grief is taboo, but the truth is that only by talking about the very things that scare us the most do we take the very power they hold over us away. #grief #bereavementsupport #griefawareness

The Grief Of Alzheimer'sToday as I left my friend sitting alone in his room, tears streamed down my face.All day he had been calling my name and yet when I was there, he didn’t know it was me.When I told him, a smile appeared, for a moment, then it was lost.He sat there, thinner, more frail and pretty much only speaking to me in Spanish.The man I once knew, the surrogate grandfather to my children, disappearing slowly over the last few years.And as I drove home, still teary, I realised that what I was feeling was grief.Grief for him, as he told me he couldn’t remember, and that he was going mad. Grief for his lack of quality of life. Grief for the man he once was. And grief for me, the only person he has, his essential caregiver and the anticipation of what is yet to come for him…possibly years more of this heartbreaking decline.Grief in relation to dementia was not something I had considered, but I certainly do now. In the end it may even feel like you are dealing with two deaths… The one as the person fades away and then their actual physical death.And somehow we don’t talk about grieving while someone is still alive. We feel we shouldn’t feel it, we feel guilty, as if we are letting them down. We even fear the judgement of others, and so keep it bottled up, just trying to soldier on.But grief comes from significant loss, and that loss is happening right before your eyes with Alzheimer’s.Give yourself permission to feel the grief as you go through this with your loved one, it is painful, heart wrenching… and normal.If you are struggling with a situation like this, reach out, if not to me, to someone you can  talk to. #grief #griefawareness #griefsupport #griefcoach #caregiver #caregiversupport #alzheimers

Grief isn't always the death of a loved one, it can be the diagnosis of an illness, the giving up of a dream, or so many other ways that we might lose things that are dear to us.Some people always know what to say  whilst others are conspicuous in their silence, but anxiety around saying the "right thing" can often mean staying silent seems the safer option. Sue Ryder have a wonderful #GriefKind initiative to help support those going through grief. You can order a free kit, with links to podcasts and useful articles, and also a set of cards that helps to say what you might be thinking. without having to actually say it!Although the cards are designed to be sent to somebody going through the loss of a loved one, I feel the sentiments can be used for most people going through this crazy #permacrisis at the moment.

The moment Rowcroft Hospice got involved with Mum, everything got easier - even though it also meant everything got harder! In the comments I have linked to my post about death planning. Having honest conversations about dying and funeral planning and all the rest of it made bereavement so much easier. The only thing we can be certain on in life is that it will end, so we all need to be having these conversations.If you would like help starting a difficult, often uncomfortable conversation like this, please contact me to see how coaching could help you tackle it head on!#death #bereavement #grief #deathanddying #deathpositive #funeralplanning #hospice #fundraiser #coaching #difficultconversations

Did you know 1 in 14 kids will experience the death of a parent or sibling by the age of 18?Research suggests that some children and youth who experience a significant death will find it to be profoundly stressful and traumatizing.

The changing of the leaves, the crispness of the air, and hot, delicious drinks are all reasons why this is one of my favorite times of the year! 🍁Be this as it may, it’s also a time of increased illness, feelings of grief, and a compromised respiratory system. Some of my favorite methods for creating balance during autumn, strengthening myself against contagious illness, and fortifying my lungs include:🍂 Intentionally focusing on slow belly breathing. A good ratio is five deep, belly breaths in and eight full exhales. 🍂 Releasing sorrow. Autumn is the ideal season to address emotions such as sorrow, depression, and grief. It’s also a great time to lay the groundwork for putting to rest those areas in our lives that are not beneficial to emotional health, which includes a non-stop work schedule, taking on social engagements that drain us, or even food choices that create emotional instability.🍂 Enjoying all the produce that is now seasonally available! These include apples, pears, plums, blueberries and blackberries, pomegranates, pumpkins and squash, and root vegetables!🍂 Clearing the clutter. Usually, we associate springtime with this activity, but I have found that autumn is a wonderful time to clean our spaces as it prepares us for the winter ahead.🍂 Using medicinal herbs for immune support. My Essential Winter Defense Bundle contains a powerful collection of herbal medicines that includes my popular All-Purpose (First-Aid) Salve, Bronchial Blend, Elderberry, Yarrow, and Yerba Santa tinctures, plus an antiviral/antibacterial Usnea Throat Spray.Interested in reading more about ways you can maintain and improve physical and emotional health this fall season?

The holiday season is upon us which means I am once again reflecting. In particular, I'm feeling grateful for the evolution of Hummingbird Humanity  since we launched in May 2020 and excited about what's ahead for us in 2023. This time of year, sparks reflection for many as we look back on our journey - in our personal lives and in our workplaces - and look ahead toward what's possible.  I try to remember that change often sparks a feeling of loss which leads to a variety of emotions. That's normal for us humans.Sign up for the #HummingbirdHumanity newsletter for weekly content, resources, and more right to your inbox: https://lnkd.in/ezdpyNdU#HummingbirdHumanity #Leadership #HumanCenteredCulture #DEI #HR #ChangeManagement #Grief #Gratitude #CEO #Founder

late May 2022, I made a decision to uproot my life and go travelling for a while. embracing the digital nomad lifestyle.I found out that I was letting go of an identity that I felt attached to. Talking to a friend she was going through a grieving process too. I asked her if we could have a recorded conversation.Here it is, a conversation on grief and letting go.#grief #lettinggo #griefandlettinggo #change

I don’t talk or write about God much, but I believe in the deepest parts of my soul that God gave me this mountain to climb to show others that they too can endure the darkest of tragedies and come out on the other side a changed person for the better—stronger, more resilient, more grateful, more loving, and more able to embrace the beautiful parts of life despite suffering a great loss. God didn’t just give me a small mountain to survive. He put one of the most treacherous mountains in front of me and told me to rise. He knew that only in overcoming the unimaginable, would I be able to be a guide and example for others. It was the ultimate test. In the last 12 months I have watched the love of my life die in front of me twice—one of those times watching him become a shell of the strong man he was during 22 days on hospice. I watched my husband in a coma, be completely helpless, and have to endure multiple medical procedures. I had to do this all while pregnant and also give birth by myself. I had to learn how to live by myself and care for a baby and a toddler. I had to mourn the loss of my identity as a wife and police spouse. I had to say good bye to my husband’s K9 Louie who was apart of our family for three years. I had (and continue to) have to watch my 4 year old grieve the loss of his daddy. I had to say good bye to my husband’s best friend and my dear friend 6 weeks after my husband’s death. The past 12 months have been filled with tragedy, death and so much darkness. I don’t say all of this for pity or praise but to show that no matter how treacherous of a mountain you are climbing right now that there is hope. You didn’t get to choose the size of your mountain but you get to decide how you want to climb it and the person you want to become on the other side. If anything, I want my adversities to serve as an example of the challenges that God can put in front of you and how powerful you become in climbing an impossible terrain. The journey won’t be easy. It will be ungraceful, messy, dark, scary, and bring you to your knees at times. But in any darkness, there is a light to be found✨.......#widowlife #widows #widowed #youngwidow #hopeforwidows #griefislove #widowshelpingwidows #widowsofinstagram #widow #widowspeak #normalizegrief #death #griefjourney #griefsupport #griefsucks #griefawareness #griefrecovery #refugeingrief #grief #k9officer #loveafterloss #policewife #leowife #griefhealing #lossofalovedone #lifeafterloss #bereavement #goodgrief #widowhood #growingaroundgrief

The traditional Western approach to accepting death is not particularly emotionally realistic. This has, possibly been exacerbated, by the way we have had to deal with death during the pandemic. #death #bereavementsupport #bereavement #griefandloss #griefsupport #grief https://lnkd.in/gwAEmkzT

・Be open to what grief can teach you ...After her younger brother Chad died of a heart attack, high school teacher Janell Sowers Cinquini discovered that she was more willing to talk to her students about the hard things they were going through."One of my students found his dad dead. I don't know all of the circumstances. But he came to school after it happened because he didn't know where else to go. School was his safe place. During class, I knelt down next to his desk and said, 'I heard, and I'm so sorry.' Five years ago, before my brother died, I wouldn't have done that. I wouldn't have known that he wanted me to say something."#leadingthroughloss #griefatwork #griefintheworkplace #grief #loss #ontargetconsulting

Grief comes as a part of living, and is often one of the most hardest of emotions to process. Especially when we can’t find it in ourselves to recognise and accept how we feel, let alone put a name to our emotions. We therefore tend to sit in our helplessness, feeling as if the words to express ourselves haven’t and might never come into existence. Yet, what if they did exist and you were yet to find them?Being one of the most accurate of languages to express emotion, here are the main ways Italian expresses ‘Grief’:1. Pena: Describes a feeling of sorrow which aches you deeply, like a heartache. This is used to represent the feelings of shame, regret and sadness that we may feel during grief.2. Dolore: Literally describes the pain and hurt we may feel, and is typically associated with the ‘anger’ stage of grief.3. Lutto: Is complex in its simplicity. It literally means ‘mourning’, but it’s very much associated with the acceptance of feeling grief as well as its letting go and moving on process too.Grief comes as a part of living, but in reality it comes from having known love. For that, there'll never be words enough to describe. #allsoulsday #linguist #grief

You who have trudged through with a heavy heart...Lay down your burden and rest. You who have never heard a word of love spoken to you...Lay down your grief and rest. You who have a need but never received help... Lay down your sorrow and rest. Rest in the arms of the Mighty One, the Lord Who has seen all your struggles and loves you immensely. Allow Him to calm your heart, soothe your fears and comfort you.  Allow Him to take care of your burdens, take away your grief and meet your needs. "The Lord your God in your midst,The Mighty One, will save;He will rejoice over you with gladness,He will quiet you with His love,He will rejoice over you with singing.”Zephaniah 3:17 NKJV Yes, He sings over you. Are you finding it hard to believe that He sings? Listen to the most beautiful notes sung by birds and every musical note you have ever heard... did He not create them too? Yes He sings... ask Him to help you hear His song. Get away from all the noise. Sit in a quiet place and ask Him to help you hear His voice. Have a quiet and musical weekend! 🕊🎵🎶   #love #help #quiet #singing #peace #rest #grief #burden #needs #sorrow #struggle #calm

Ancient wisdom and modern science agree  that we become what we think about all day long.✅ Our repeated thoughts lead to changes in how we act.😳 Have you ever said “I don’t know who I am anymore?” 🥵 Or “I don’t like how sad/ angry / anxious I am now” 😢 Or “How did I get like this?➡️ Neurons that fire together, wire together. If this sounds familiar, reflect on your thoughts.💖 Ask yourself:➡️ What am I repeatedly focusing on? ➡️ What is the energy behind my thoughts? Is it a fear or hurt that is driving my thoughts?➡️ How is this effecting 'who' I am? ➡️ Am I willing to move from fear based thoughts to love based thoughts? 💖 If you are ready to make a shift, I can help you LOVE your life again.⚡️Energetic clearing is a powerful and simple way to release the blocks in your life. 🧳 Emotional baggage may impact how you think, the choices you make, your abundance and your happiness. ⚡️Opening your energetic channels allows the natural flow of energy through your body.  When your energy is in a flow state, your intuition is high, and your natural state is joy. 💝 Give yourself the gift of you!

We all have our own experiences, views and ways to manage grief, but recently I have read The Grieving Brain by Mary-Frances O'Connor PhD.Consider this. Your behaviour is learnt. Each day at 6pm your partner pulls his or her car onto the drive and a moment later you hear their key in the lock.This happens time after time over many years so you associate and have learned that at this particular time this event happens.Then they die.Yet, at the same time each day you expect to hear their car pull up and key in the lock.So, we need to re-programme our brains and learn something new. Just because it is 6pm, it no longer means that our loved one has arrived home.Learning something new takes time.....Please remember this and be kind to yourself.For tools to help you support a child with grief, please visit https://lnkd.in/drrSGjNQ#thegrievingbrain #grief #bereavement #healingthepain #learningnewways

Today is part of the Mexican Diadelosmuertos celebration. The quote from the movie Coco makes a very good point. For so many people in grief, their way of dealing with it is to make it all ok for others. Is this your way too?It’s a coping mechanism that stops us having time to replenish our own resources. If we keep pouring from this teapot without refilling it, what will come out for those we’re offering tea?Grief therapy is one way to invest in our own wellbeing during a tough time. Let’s start refilling your teapot.connect@rewiretherapy.co.uk #grief #griefandloss #griefcounseling #wellbeing #resilience #tea

Living with chronic pain means that we need to pay attention to what we do so that we avoid those painful flare ups.It is not always that simple, is it?There are times you may want to do that little bit extra either at work or in your personal life, it makes you feel "normal" again. You are conflicted, on one hand you want to do more and on the other you dread those painful flare ups.The flare ups make you slow down, take time off work, miss the events you were so looking forward to and it also makes you feel guilty as you feel you are letting yourself and others down.What you are feeling is normal given the circumstances you are in. A flare up can be a time for great learning, as well as a good time to recharge your batteries so that you can continue making that impact in the world you have always desired.You have this! x#Grief#Resilience#Pain#LongTermHealthConditions#InvisibleDisabilities#ClinicalProjectManager

Buried Messages Grief Workshop: Grief, Loss, and Faith | Register at www.themessages.net/eventsHow do Christians handle grief?  Do we deny the feelings that come naturally while hiding the pain behind a scripture, or do we talk to someone about what we are feeling?  After losing someone, you love, you may wonder if you will ever get through the pain and if your faith is enough.   Trusting God is easy when things are going well, but what happens when you lose someone you love and have prayed hard for them to be healed?  Grief is the normal reaction to a significant loss, whether a bereavement loss or non-death loss. It can disrupt your physical health, making sleeping, eating, and continuing daily tasks difficult. These are normal reactions to loss--and the more significant the loss, the more intense your grief. Join my guests and me as we discuss and process grief, loss, and faith:  Pastor Sheila L. Edwards of  Sheila L. Edwards Ministries.Pastor James Turner, Eastvale Bible Church, Eastvale, California.

It's the thin time of the year....Guisers ghoulish and superhero'd came to our door on Monday night: Halloween. Pumpkin Lanterns welcomed them, by contrast with the Turnip Lanterns of older times which were placed around a home to keep at bay foul fiends and Spirits.Halloween is the Eve of All Saints Day, a Christian festival celebrating the lives of saints great and small.Today is All Souls Day, another Christian festival when people actively recall and remember their loved ones in church services. The names of their loved ones are read out and prayers offered for their wellbeing.The festival of Samhain is also kept at this time. Ancestors are actively recalled and remembered by their families and friends, with a feast held in their honour. Places are set for them, and plates filled with food to nourish them. Conversations turn to remembering times good and bad, and requests are made to these Ancestors for their protection, help and guidance in the coming year as Samhain marks the Pagan New Year.In the Southern hemisphere and other places the Mexican Day of the Dead is celebrated richly. Processions with puppets line the streets and people dress in clothes and with faces painted in honour of the feast. Marigolds are everywhere: their scent creating a trail for the Ancestors to find their way back to their families for this brief time when all are gathered together.  Tables are laden with food; visits are made to the graves where loved ones are buried. Death is both acknowledged and mocked alongside the vibrancy of life. Loved ones are actively remembered and recalled.Each of these festivals has much to offer us:They remind us of the closeness of death, just a breath awayThey invite us to be less afraid of deathThey invite us to consider that there may be far more to life, and death, than we might believe or think...They encourage us actively to recall and remember our loved ones who've journeyed on, and to continue to enjoy a relationship with them through our active remembering and talking about them.Whether or not we're grieving these rich festivals offer us hope, encouragement and comfort.I remember with gratitude the many people who've shared with me their various experiences of visitations by their loved ones, and how these visitations have helped them become less afraid of death, deepen their inner lives, and forge a different kind of relationship with them which isn't confined by a body, time and space. I'm full of gratitude for my own Ancestors who continue to help, guide and protect me.Still in this earthly life, my thanks to Roger Ce on Unsplash for the photo. #grief #death #deathanddying #celebratelife #mexicandayofthedead #samhain #halloween2022

My TURNING POINT...How many of you have tried to address a simple yet frustrating aspect of your behaviour such as a bad habit with one that is more productive only to find yourself return back to square one and feeling defeated?  It's like we are living on AUTO-PILOT and despite what we KNOW we cannot bridge the gap to DO the things we must do to make lasting change.A PIVOTAL moment in my life came last January when at the young age of 56 years old with so much to live for, I lost my big sister Nikki to brain cancer.  I know that this isn't something that is exclusive to my family but the EMOTIONAL IMPACT and sense of LOSS was absolutely devastating.  It's an emotional journey for loved ones to watch helplessly while they go through this and the lasting grief that goes along with it.  What I learned and what has been proven is the following;CHANGE COMES FROM one of two things. EXTREME EMOTIONAL IMPACT1) a deep emotional impact such as a death, divorce, illness, job loss, financial ruin, traumaORREPETITION2) repetition of a new behaviour and thought pattern done again and again and again with a clearly defined purpose and dedicationIn this case obviously it was the EMOTIONAL DEVASTATION that became my breakdown which I had to reframe as a breakthrough- my big sister wouldn't have wanted me to be defeated by this but to honour her memory by BECOMING THE BEST VERSION OF MYSELF.  I decided that I would pursue what fills my bucket and embrace my passion to help others and share a lifetime of learning and helping.This Summer was a very special moment for me.  I visited Hawaii and went to Maui which was my sister's favourite place on earth and I let her ashes go into a black rock lagoon surrounded by palm trees and endless blue skies and water.  The experience was profound and it ignited a series of changes in me that live on every single day.I am FULLY EMBRACING my joy and I am filled with nothing but GRATITUDE for the life I have and the opportunities that it provides.  I love deeper, I listen more closely, I empathize fully, I don't allow negative energy to get near me and I CHOOSE my MINDSET and am not distracted by EXTERNAL EVENTS.How about you?  Are YOU LIVING your BEST LIFE?  If not, WHY NOT?Let's CONNECT- I am walking the talk, I'm happy to help you get UNSTUCK and get moving!CHANGE YOUR STORY...#sister #hawaii #life #live #change #stuck #growth #evolve #change #coach #coaching #chrisabbott #thinkingintoresults #progress #gratitude #mindset #breakthrough #career #death #loss #grief #reframe #love #family #sister

🎧 Podcast Recommendation 🎧#throwback   👤 Chris Eubank Jr - Boxer and son of Chris Eubank ! 🎤 I am not a massive boxing fan but growing up in the 1990s,  I would enjoy watching the big fights with boxers Chris Eubank, Prince Naseem and Mike Tyson.I did not know much about Chris Eubank Jr when I listened to the podcast so was unsure of what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to hear how articulate, reflective and measured Chris is.This episode is less about boxing and more about learning valuable lessons that help us navigate life.Steven Bartlett is a brilliant interviewer!📝 Points of interest 🥊 His father's discipline and strictness kept him on the straight and narrow🥊 Importance of Self-awareness, Self-discipline and Self-reliance🥊 Family is everything. So emotional hearing about how he coped with the death of his brother who seemed like a lovely person and was loved by those that met him.  We hear how Chris is now helping to raise his young nephew🥊 Social media - why keeping some aspects of your life private is important🥊 Emotions - different ways of expressing emotions 🥊 Memory difficulties - could it be related to boxing ? Well worth a listen.  💡What did you think of the podcast ?I would really welcome your thoughts and comments.  ——🎧 I’m posting the Apple Podcast link but episodes usually also available on Spotify, Google Podcasts and other podcast platforms. #boxing #chriseubank #discipline #grief #socialmedia #podcast #podcasting

In the mid-1990s, Continuing Bonds theory marked a major shift in how the process of grieving was perceived. We don’t leave our dead loved ones behind and sever ties — our bond with them continues!It was such a joy be on the Continuing Bonds panel during the recent Good Grief Festival event series, themed Grief + Memory, with Julia Samuel MBE and Jane Harris of The Good Grief Project.I got to talk about how my mom inspired The Grief Gallery and how I stay connected with her, in my everyday life as well as through my exhibitions and events.When I decided to help others who are grieving and started developing my own grief coaching frameworks and tools, I looked back at why what I did was so helpful and healing. As I learned about contemporary grief research, I could see how the Continuing Bonds theory aligned so nicely with how I use curating and creativity to help us remember our dead loved ones.A couple of reflections I had following the talk:• We can carry people forward with us in different ways. Jane wears a bracelet with her son Josh’s ashes, which means he can easily travel with her and their family, including a recent trip to Kilimanjaro. I scattered my mom’s ashes in multiple locations including Paris and Peru, and take comfort in the thought that some part of her is present when I travel to those places. But more importantly, we carry our loved ones in our hearts and minds wherever we go.• Choose what you want to carry with you moving forward, to make it easier to stay connected. On the theme of traveling and carrying our loved ones forward, it’s helpful to curate — to choose with intention — what we keep, what we hold, what takes up space. If we try to keep everything, to carry everything with us, we’re going to feel overwhelmed or weighed down. Hello, luggage fees and emotional baggage!• None of this is prescriptive, they're all only possibilities. During talks and workshops, I often offer ideas and options for creating as a way to stay connected with our loved ones. But it’s always just an idea, not an assignment! Grievers already face so many hard choices — the intention is to make things easier for you, not harder. To lighten the load, not to add to the burden!Thank you again to Lesel Dawson Lucy Selman Katrin Helene-Deeg and all of the Good Grief Festival team for the invitation and a lovely mini-festival. The replay will be up on YouTube this month.#griefsupport #grief #goodgrieffestival

“Don’t become a hostage to what you have lost.”  In our newest We Are Human Leaders podcast episode, George Kohlrieser explains that dealing with grief is not a ‘one and done’. Instead, it’s an ongoing process. Acknowledging grief empowers us to treat it as a natural aspect of our lives rather than something to be filed away.  However, when we ignore, bypass or push away our grief, it becomes 'stuck' and this unresolved grief can continue to impact our lives into the future.Learn about grief and loss with us, in this candid and revealing conversation with George.It's a conversation we ALL need to have.

At last night's #grief doula #training session, one segment involved understanding the concept of #anticipatorygrief about one's own #mortality & how it could be #transformed into an 'evolutionary virtue', so that at the moment of #death, one could pass from this world to the other in a gentle way. With the analysis of the book, Tuesday's with Morrie preceding this exercise, all the Doula Trainees in the Autumn Cohort understood quite clearly why it was important to #live well in order to #die well. Cultivating what I like to call the '#evolutionary virtue' represents our deepest #soul desire. It can be likened to an oar that can help one row across the river of life. Interestingly enough, the #virtue words that emerged from this exercise weren't happiness or joy, things we blindly chase in life, for in death, we seek virtues that shape & color our souls. These take a lifetime to cultivate & so recognising your unique virtue is important, so it may guide your #living. Shared below are the key words that came up in yesterday's training session. What #soulvirtue are you cultivating, that will help you across the river of #lifeanddeath?

#anger is often a mask for other emotions that we might be feeling. Many express anger when they are feeling #depression, or #grief, or #fear.  In #therapy, we make space for all of these emotions to understand - to resolve pain, to find constructive responses, and to feel whole.

Anchoring in momentsI took this photo on 14 June 2022.I had just managed my mothers return home after her final stay in hospital.I had sorted the complex daily care that someone needs at end of life.A live in carer4  '2 handed' care visits a dayDistrict Nurse visitsWhat felt like 100's of pills to be taken every dayThe emotional trauma of not knowing when the inevitable would happen but being prepared for it at any moment.My Mum died 5 days later on 19 June 2022.I'm glad I captured this moment with a photo.For me it is a life defining moment.One where I knew I had to step away.I had to anchor in that moment - to feel and be present.To seek peace despite the absolute horror of the situation.I share this on Linked In, not for sympathy but, to show that, in the midst of what is the biggest life transition I've experienced to date, anchoring in a moment is a very powerful and effective way to be present, to seek to thrive and value every experience life offers us.Tomorrow over in my private facebook group I will be talking about how we can move through transitions. I will be going live at 10am. If you want to join the group and the conversation see link in the comments.I'm looking forward to sharing my learning and talking more about how moments matter in transition. Whether you are going through change or managing others through change I hope the session will be helpful.#grief #loss #endoflife #transition #change #fridaycoffeebreak #leadyourway

#RealPhysicianReacts #Coping #Grief

In this episode of Real Physician Reacts we will be discussing a very real and scary trend with how the general public deals with death and the issue of desensitization  of death as we experience more and more of it up close and personal. 

This week we lost another hip hop star Take Off from the Migos tragically  and almost immediately we were bombarded with images and even video of his last moments here with us. 

Tonight I am going to discuss what that says about the current state of society that we have readily accepted being able to watch someone take their last breath and move on about our day as if nothing has occurred?  

Several discussion points today
1. The tragic loss of another hip hop star?
2. How society has accepted a lack of emotion when it comes to dealing with death
3. What does it mean for our mental health in the future if we continue to become

Happy Thursday! Hey Faithers! It Is Day 3 of the 30-Day Linkedin Challenge.Day 3: 📓 Favorite Book or Current Read:📓 I made a goal to read at least 15 books in 2022. I am currently on book number 23. I do not have a favorite book yet because I thoroughly enjoy reading, and I think most books I read I just think they're the best and I use them as a resource in my personal and professional.🦋 I am currently reading Home Coming by Thema Bryant. This current read focuses on returning back to you. This is a common theme in my life. There is homework at the end of each chapter that assists with the journey of coming back home! 🦋✅Day 3 of Linkedin 30-Day Challenge Completed#loveyouthewayyoulovetheworld🌎 #work #community #linkedin #people #postwithTrinity #30DayPostChallenge #grief #healing #selflove #selfcare #selfloveistruelove #selfcareisthebestcare #writing #journaling #socialwork #MSW #communitysocialwork

The loss of those who mean the world to us is devastating. Having lost our beloved Alisha, untimely and unexpectedly, yesterday corroborates that yet again, given the mess I am in. Companion animals, whether stray or pet, are family, no matter what opinion others may hold. We need to give the human-animal bond the same respect we accord to the human-human bond. So, grieving the loss of a companion animal is okay and it is perfectly fine to seek support and help. It is totally on us how we wish to break the shackles around the most disenfranchised form of grief. If you want to share your story, grief, lighten your heart in the company of empaths, or want to stand in solidarity with those who have lost their companion animal (homed/un-homed, pet, stray), please join us for the support group meeting slated for the 13th of November at 2030 hours Indian Standard Time (IST). Write to us at bridgingrainbows.india@gmail.com for the meeting ID and passcode. Please do remember to mention your name and also the context in regard to which you would like to attend the support group meeting. We bridge time zones, you are welcome to join us from any corner of the world.This is a service in honour of our beloved Butter, free of cost.

Sometimes, it is good to just talk. Here at Cruse Scotland we have hundreds of amazing volunteers who listen to and counsel bereaved children, young people and adults throughout Scotland each year. In her recent blog, Lilian, one of our volunteer counsellors writes about why she became a counsellor and the routine that she goes through before every session she undertakes. Such and interesting read and it demonstrates the dedication, skill, listening and understanding that all of our volunteers bring to Cruse Scotland. Thank you Lilian, and thank you to all of our fabulous volunteers. Lilian's blog can be read here https://buff.ly/3GwL9W4 #volunteer #counselling #grief #bereavement #blog #charity #loss

It's an honor @tinybuddha published my essay. "Children’s Movies are Obsessed with Death, but Don’t Show Healthy Grief."Children see death repeatedly in #film, but not #grief. The audience sees a tear over a grave, then 60 seconds later the main character is fighting the dragon, building the robot, or saving the world.That's not how #grieving works. We need grief literacy for our children. It has to be part of the conversation growing up.If you're interested in learning more about helping children grief, please check out the essay and pick up my book, #touchingtwoworlds, a guide for finding hope in the landscape of loss. https://lnkd.in/e8wa9Tcz

Often, emotions aren't welcome at work.So, for those of us struggling with big life events, like the loss of a relationship or loved one, a change of job title or role, or perhaps our favorite work colleague has resigned... we have to put on a brave face and push away these big feelings to get through our work day.But, what if we created the space for humans to experience their emotions at work? What might that look like?In this week's We Are Human Leaders podcast episode, we explore Grief with George Kohlrieser, former CIA Hostage Negotiator and Professor of Leadership and Organizational Behavior at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD). George helps us unpack how we can constructively deal with grief at work in a very practical way.In this hugely vulnerable conversation, we get real about what it feels like to be in grief, and the consequences of grief left unresolved. It's a conversation every human being needs to hear.Tune in on your commute or work break today - live everywhere you access podcasts.

How are you feeling overall???If a friend or family member or colleague was to ask you this...would your answer be one listed in the flower image below? Be honest with yourself and admit how you are feeling. Write your answer or answers down. Do a check-in with yourself throughout the day and really be willing to delve into the question.Change requires honesty, acceptance, acknowledgement, desire to make a change and then action.We ALL have felt some or many of the words/feelings/thoughts listed in the flower below. We ALL have been exposed to or dealt with loss, grief, bereavement, sadness, anxiety, and stress at some point in our lives...It has been proven the last few years with pandemic.You are not alone. There are many of us out there that care, are kind, compassionate, honest, loving souls.

#Age is just a number, you're only as old as your #spirit feels, even though the body may disagree. While I have had a month of being spoilt rotten, and a year of special experiences and moments to cherish, on my actual #birthday yesterday I participated in #DomesticAbuse Community Ambassador #AwarenessTraining through #SuttonWomensCentre  with some familiar faces and several strangers. The second-day of that training is next week, it falls on the date of my #heavenly #baby girl's 2nd day of her 3 days outside my womb - she would be 28 if she were here #TahliaJasmine 💞I remain grateful to TJ for coming and going and leaving me with a #wound from where much #light has poured into my #heartandsoul. As her mother, I chose to be the one to switch off her life support machine on 11/11/94. Her journey was short, there was pain and #grief but the memory of her is #supersweet. I found strength in Love, and in my dreams of her.While the boys (hubby and both sons, TJ's step-family) enjoyed their weekly 5-aside footie match last night, before coming home and us all enjoying a nice dinner, I baked a carrot cake. I hardly ever bake so I was delighted that this recipe turned out to be oh so delicious - I had no walnuts nor pecans so I crushed almonds instead, and I omitted the nutmeg as I didn't have that either. I used cream cheese from a tub, not a block, and reduced the over the top amount of sugar the recipe stated - I made the most of what I had to hand and said many #bismillahs with every beat 💞This is the recipe I used if you want to make your own...https://lnkd.in/evw4H3cvMy #birthdaywish for #humanity is that we all find a way to light the candle of love in our hearts and let that light shine before we meet our own inevitable end, and that we make life sweet for ourselves and for one another, and support those most in need.I'm reminded of words to my own song lyrics written at the start of this year - "we are not here to learn, we are here to #remember" - Samia.#Community #Rumi #Love #Life #Death #Cake

Grief isn’t just when someone dies… grief happens through diagnosis of illness, losing a partner, losing a friend, losing a dream. Grief can be what you wish someone would be when you see other peoples functional relationships. When you give yourself space to grieve you are saying “it’s ok for me to feel this way, and to accept it will take time to grow around these feelings.” #grief #buddingresiliencetherapies #counsellingservices #socialwork #tfcbttherapist #traumainformed #loss #counsellingpsychology #sydney #caddenscorner #mentalhealth

One of the most prominent and universal emotional experiences humans have is grief and loss. And yet these concepts are still often considered taboo in the modern workplace. Our guest on this week’s episode of We Are Human Leaders is George Kolhrieser, a former CIA hostage negotiator and now a Professor of Leadership and Organizational Behavior who specializes in the impact of grief in the workplace. George helps us unpack the impact of unresolved grief and gives us practical insights into how we can understand grief in ourselves, and support those around us who're experiencing grief.This episode was wildly vulnerable for Sally and Alexis, as they took a deep dive into how they've experienced grief with George to candidly uncover how grief has impacted their lives and career.This episode is absolutely not to be missed, listen now everywhere you access podcasts!

As long as it is not toxic, dangerous, or wasteful I believe in staying committed to whatever I signed up for.Staying committed to #positive people, places and things helps us grow. On the other hand, staying committed to toxic people, places, and things does not serve us (although severance of said toxins does exemplify maturity and #growth ). Staying #committed doesn’t mean there will not be difficult days. The gym is a positive place. But it can be difficult for me to stay committed to the gym when something at work, for example, is pressing. To stay consistently committed, I’ve realized that exercising BEFORE I begin my duties for Morgan Stanley increases the chances of me actually getting the exercise in. I could easily not wake up at 4:30AM or 5:00AM to exercise before getting ready for work. I could easily let my body go, sleep-in, and then “blame #work “ for the consequences of not following through on my commitment to the gym. The same analogy can be applied when a loss is experienced. I specifically remember the moment my Grandmother passed of #cancer last year. I took 2 weeks off of work and made the decision to go for #walks , practice #yoga , and stay in the #gym (even if the commitment of movement wasn’t as rigorous — I refused to allow #loss and #grief to disturb my commitment to my body/mind complex). Staying committed requires #flexibility . If you are rigid, if you only excercise when “everything is perfect and everyone is getting along,” it’s going to be tough for you, because everything is never #perfect and everyone is not always getting along lol!!!! Stay committed to your positive commitments using flexibility and self-compassion. And when you’ve managed to stay committed through the storms, don’t forget to pat YOURSELF on the back (as only you know what it reaaaaallly takes to stay committed to your commitments). #motivation #commitment #positivity #toxic #culture #youcandoit

The days before death are a time for reflection, for deep contemplation of a life lived. Of love lost, regrets held, and (hopefully) peace finally reached. Listen to your loved ones as they reflect on their life. There is wisdom that comes when a person faces his or her own mortality. The best way to honor their lives is to learn from them and make our own lives even better.  If you need emotional and spiritual support as you and your loved ones go through end-of-life, call me. I’m here for you.

EpilogueIf we surviveour descendants may look backon the declineof our “civilized” empireand wonder:Did they know?When they realized,were they kind? Or did theyscratch each other bloodywith dull, infected claws?After the EMPs and EFTsand AIs and IEDsthey’ll wonder about us:Did they try to stop it?Were there no prophets?How were their wise ones ignorant of what our little ones understand:That no human survives alonenor thrives when the fewhave too much.That all the children reap the harvestof all the ancestors’ seeds.That we need the rivers and trees,the rain and rotting soil, the butterflies and sunrisefar more than they need us.And all lifeis finite.They will stand where they imagineour graves might lie,asking,yet hear only silence.Still, my ghost will call out from beneath roots and shootsand centuries of sediment:Yes, we did.But we were too few and too late.You still have time.The Earth awaits, indifferent.© S.

Did you know that all of our NAN volunteers are required to take a Grief and Bereavement course? This allows them to provide unique and specialized support to our NAN families. The full-day course dispels common myths and misconceptions about children's grief. They learn how to answer kids' tough questions about cancer and death. In addition, they can provide NAN kids with the tools and transferrable skills they can use throughout their lifetime. All our volunteers have the knowledge they need to confidently support our NAN kids through the most challenging time in their young lives.#griefandbereavement #bereavementeducation #grief #griefjourney #griefsupport #griefandlosssupport #bereavementsupport #copingskills #copingstrategies #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthsupport #mentalhealthtips #psychology #psychotherapy #psychotherapists

Having had the opportunity to take care of my mother before she died. My mom taught me that some days you just have to breathe.Now I know for sure that more difficult times will come and also more days of happy, silly bliss. I know sometimes it will rain. Sometimes we’ll feel as though the sun will shine forever. We’ll witness loss. We’ll have gains.Every day is a series of ins and outs. We think things should stay in a straight line, full speed ahead, but they don’t. They go up and down. In and out.How blessed I am now to have seen what it’s like to really breathe, to be so fully absorbed in the in and out of breath as to know that it is the most important thing. Not how you do it, for how long or for why, but simply that you breathe. And when you need it most, the rest will fall away and you’ll have the in and out.Sometimes you’ll find it may be all you really need.#grief #holidayseason

Dare To Share Your Untold Story Episode 59 " Struck with grief. Navigating control. Impacted by choice. Learning Resilience" featuring guest Sara Westbrook.Sara shares an emotional journey she experienced at the age of 21 when her father died, only 4 weeks after a health diagnosis. She mentioned that her journey of grief started 10 years before that when her parents separated, and she had to learn how to accept not seeing her father every day.She did learn how to navigate control, understand how to set healthy boundaries with herself, while making sense of all the other confusing emotions brought on by the experience of death.Her key message to the listeners is that: challenges are chapters of your life, not the whole story; emotions will be triggered, and they will feel awkward; find ways to bring them in the light; seek help, commit to the process, and stay determined to put in the effort; overtime effort will pay off; there is so much more of your story yet to write.Listen to the full podcast now:iTunes - https://apple.co/3zd2bozSpotify - https://spoti.fi/3tG7Y4OStitcher - https://bit.ly/3nBh5CIGoogle Podcasts - https://bit.ly/3kd3ekcYoutube - https://lnkd.in/gHs4e2pu#grief #depression #DareToHeal #Therapy #MentalHealth #SelfCare #MentalHealthAwareness #Anxiety #Healing #SelfLove #Psychology #Wellness #Therapist #Depression #MentalHealthMatters #Counselling #Mindfulness #Motivation #Trauma #Happiness #OwnYourStory #TherapistsOfInstagram #Support #MentalBeauty #MentalBeautyRethink #DareToShare #LetsTalk #TheMentalBeautyRethink

Difficult chapters drop into our lives with an invitation attached. They invite us to recommit... To this life. To our path. To our being. They whisper in our ear, “Hey.. Would you like to get to know yourself more deeply?” They wake us up in the middle of the night and whisper again, just to make sure we heard. They stand ready as a quide to help us explore and feel into the contours of our being. To open the windows of our soul and to see what lay in wait there. You’ll want to say no to it all.

Oh dear William, is there anything that you can't put into words? That must be why you, are and will always be, my favorite author!Seeing so many people lately sharing their grief for lost loved ones on this platform makes my heart break every single time for each and every one of them and their families. It also, on the flip side, feels like the strongest connection that there ever was! I believe I heard it said that when you lose someone, you are part of a club that no one wants membership in, but everyone at some point must join. It is so beyond true.Writing this with tears in my eyes, I decided today once again, to lean into the grief. Even though losing my father happened three years ago, it feels sometimes as if it were only yesterday. (lately, there have been a lot of tears flowing)Shakespeare puts it so eloquently, that no one knows how they will grieve until they are in the middle of it. There is no one RIGHT way to handle losing someone close to you. Especially someone who was the closest person in your world. We must ALLOW ourselves to go through what we need to go through to at least try to repair our hearts enough to allow some healing to take place.I see you all, I understand from the very depths of my soul what you are going through. Maybe not the exact situation or person lost, but I feel your pain.Today at work, is flannel day, the closest thing I have to a flannel is one of my father's old plaid dress shirts. I am wearing it with such pride today that for me, it is more than just an article of clothing, but a connection to someone I will miss until the very end of time. Be true to yourselves fellow Warriors and know that this is a UNIQUE process that no one can and should tell you how to go through, and unfortunately, there is no way around it...only straight down the center.Please also find resources that help you. I have mentioned them before but I will here again. On Instagram, I follow Addison Brasil Claire Bidwell Smith Mark Lemon @sharemygriefclub to name just a few. They are so beyond helpful on this grief journey.Also, please feel free to send a connection request to me if you are going through grief, we are so much better in this together!Emily Griffith you were sent from The Universe to help people and you are ever so much appreciated!

Feliz dÍa de los Muertos! Happy Day of the Dead! Here in the U.S., this holiday is observed on the November 1st and 2nd. In Mexico and other countries, the celebration begins October 28th through November 2nd. DÍa de los Muertos is a tradition where families honor relatives that have passed on and celebrate their memory by building altars, making their favorite foods, sugar skulls, displaying photos, and more. On November 2nd, it is believed that ALL of the souls of the deceased return to the world of the living. Today ends the celebration of honoring our loved ones that have passed on, until next time!Tell me who you're honoring this DÍa de Los Muertos.#diadelosmuertos #dayofthedead #loss #grief #honor #tradition #family #familia #mifamilia #ancestors #ancestry #austintexas

Often, emotions aren't welcome at work.So, for those of us struggling with big life events, like the loss of a relationship or loved one, a change of job title or role, or perhaps our favorite work colleague has resigned... we have to put on a brave face and push away these big feelings to get through our work day.But, what if we created the space for humans to experience their emotions at work? What might that look like?In this week's We Are Human Leaders podcast episode, we explore Grief with George Kohlrieser, former CIA Hostage Negotiator and Professor of Leadership and Organizational Behavior at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD). George helps us unpack how we can constructively deal with grief at work in a very practical way.In this hugely vulnerable conversation, we get real about what it feels like to be in grief, and the consequences of grief left unresolved. It's a conversation every human being needs to hear.Tune in on your commute or work break today - live everywhere you access podcasts.

The holiday season is here.  Many of us are getting into the festive mode, and it all begins at the beginning of November as we start to look forward to the end of the year.  Corporates are planning end of year parties, families are getting together for travel holidays etc.  But what of those who are going to experience their first holiday season without their loved ones? or those who have gone through a severe loss of job, pet, relationship - what happens to their mental wellbeing?This is the time when our mind decides to overlook that fact, and yet at the back of it, there is a glaring reality that the holidays are here, and it is going to be the first one.For me, this is my 4th year and I can tell you, it is still a blaring battle that my dad is not around.This can be and will be the hardest part of the grieving process – how do we even celebrate this season? I want to tell you, there is no need to pretend that that this is hard for you. You can and will get through this.  This is what we are made of.  And one of the ways you will, is to acknowledge your grief.  I am holding my first grief circle on Saturday 12th November at 10 a.m. If you feel compelled to join me, I’d like to invite you as we explore the concept of acknowledging our grief during this season.If you, or someone you know, or someone you work with, or someone in your team needs this special care, invite them to join me.

It’s been a little over a year since this interview on the Suicide Zen Forgiveness podcast was recorded back in September of 2021. It marked my first public conversation about my dad Jim’s suicide. The first of many. And I feel so grateful for it because it changed the trajectory of my life, making suicide awareness & prevention my new mission. Because it reinforced the power of our shared experiences and proved that there’s deep healing and strength to be found in telling our stories.

Check out Dr. Connelly's newest book on Amazon!Grief is NOT Sacred!These revolutionary concepts and tools replace the agony of grief with the joy of continuing love and connection.This book will benefit those in the helping professions as well as those who are grieving.“Dr. Connelly is a magician! His gift is his ability to reframe and shift how we perceive our broken reality based on past traumatic events, limiting beliefs, and lies that we acquired from others, which we unconsciously accepted as our life stories. It is simply BRILLIANT!!!! Grief is NOT Sacred is a road map that inspires us to break away from the shackles that keep us captive and needlessly suffering deep in the dungeons of our psyche. The result is a harmonious balance between traumatizing grief and inner peace. And that is a great gift for humanity.”- Elias Forma, DC, DACACDGET YOUR COPY NOW! http://ow.ly/MBTG50LuxmU#drjonconnelly #rrt #rapidresolutiontherapy #grief #healingjourney #jonconnelly

"The grief storm surprised me, though perhaps it shouldn’t have. I’ve always had an uneasy relationship with the winter holidays, and when my little brother died, it sealed the deal—the holidays officially sucked, the memories of happier Christmases taunting me.There’s so much pressure for the holidays to be the best time of the year. The most magical and wonderful. But it’s not like that for all of us, and that pressure can feel like salt in the wound if we’re already struggling.Over time, I’ve edged closer to accepting the mixed bag of the holidays. Creating new traditions helps. Adding in extra self-care helps. And making sure I’m allowing outlets for my grief helps.And more and more, this helps:"👉🏽 Read the rest of "Surviving the Holidays while Grieving" on Elephant Journal: https://bit.ly/3rKaGpP***This article is included in our Mental Health Month guide, and we hope the "conversation" there, through our favorite mental health-related articles, is of benefit.#mentalhealth #grief #griefsupport #grieving #holidayseason #holidays

Dare To Share Your Untold Story Episode 59 " Struck with grief. Navigating control. Impacted by choice. Learning Resilience" featuring guest Sara Westbrook.Sara shares an emotional journey she experienced at the age of 21 when her father died, only 4 weeks after a health diagnosis. She mentioned that her journey of grief started 10 years before that when her parents separated, and she had to learn how to accept not seeing her father every day.She did learn how to navigate control, understand how to set healthy boundaries with herself, while making sense of all the other confusing emotions brought on by the experience of death. Her key message to the listeners is that: challenges are chapters of your life, not the whole story; emotions will be triggered, and they will feel awkward; find ways to bring them in the light; seek help, commit to the process, and stay determined to put in the effort; overtime effort will pay off; there is so much more of your story yet to write.Listen to the full podcast now:iTunes - https://apple.co/3zd2bozSpotify - https://spoti.fi/3tG7Y4OStitcher - https://bit.ly/3nBh5CIGoogle Podcasts - https://bit.ly/3kd3ekcYoutube - https://lnkd.in/gxp7r49y#grief #depression #DareToHeal #Therapy #MentalHealth #SelfCare #MentalHealthAwareness #Anxiety #Healing #SelfLove #Psychology #Wellness #Therapist #Depression #MentalHealthMatters #Counselling #Mindfulness #Motivation #Trauma #Happiness #OwnYourStory #TherapistsOfInstagram #Support #MentalBeauty #MentalBeautyRethink #DareToShare #LetsTalk #TheMentalBeautyRethink

I went to an in-person networking event for women…It was not networking in the typical sense of the elevator pitch followed by trying to sell everyone your “thing”, but an event to bring women together on a common topic we have all experienced…Grief.As I listened to stories and other women’s experiences, I experienced a familiar feeling…we are all the same in this and so many ways.We live in a world where there are so many forces attempting to divide us, I know sometimes I forget that we are all having a human experience and learning to navigate our world.We talked about the experience of grief from our own unique and individual experience (not necessarily what caused the grief) and opened the floor to discover that the grief I have experienced in my life is grief. It is not comparable to your grief and is not a competition. AND, the grief you have experienced in your life is grief. It is not comparable to my grief and is not a competition.Grief is an experience. And while there are many different situations or circumstances we may experience this, the truth is grief is grief. In this way, we are the same…and this made me feel a little bit closer to everyone I know, meet and interact with.#WeAreAllTheSame #CommonGround #WomenEmpowerment #ItsNotACompetition #Grief

I was driving home with my mum the other evening, when I pointed out the beautiful sight of the moon, just like a brush-stroke in the sky. I expected her to marvel at the sight with me but instead she spoke from a deep place of grief & loss and told me that it was the 41st new moon since my dad had died. How beautifully, sad that for over three years she has missed getting him to go outside and (most of the time, reluctantly) view the new moon- with all its promises of hope & renewal! Grief is such a sad reality of real life & so many people live courageously carrying it. Grief connects in so many ways- Sending a comforting hug to your grief. -#positivepsychology #selfacceptance #selfcompassion #selfactualization #bestself #empowerment #wellbeing #wellbecoming #contentment #emotionalhealth #emotionalintelligence #grief #sadness #loss #existentialism #allsoulsday

When supporting children through grief, loss, change, challenges, traumas, adversity, etc, it can often be helpful to do this through the use of Superheroes. Why?.....simply because children love them, they are familiar with them, and they can often form a connection with & relate to them. Superheroes possess "special powers" or "special abilities", but are also surrounded by tragedy and adversity. Our modern Superheroes are often bereaved (often during childhood), or are struggling with other challenges in their life, which children can instantly relate to their own bereavement, loss or other daily struggles they too are experiencing.  Children can be supported by using stories and discussions around Superheroes by exploring their grief & loss as well as their resolve, resilience and their ability to not only endure those difficulties, but to live through and overcome them. This depiction of post-traumatic growth can often support, teach and inspire children to do the same. It can help them to cope with their grief, endure life's challenges, learn to forgive and find meaning in life even in the midst of the most painful experiences.The next time you sit down with your child to watch a superhero movie, look out for the struggles facing the main character/s and use this as a platform for engaging your child in discussion afterwards. You may be able to help them identify some sort of connection with these fictional characters and help gain some insight into coping strategies and positive attributes for their own struggles in life. #grief #bereavement #loss #change #adversity #trauma #superhero #children #families #support #sidebysideuaeanduk #sidebysideuk #sidebysideuae

"Re-Presenting Our Ancestors: A Grief Ritual."Saturday, Nov 19th, 2022 @ 3pm Eastern / 8pm UKRegister here: bit.ly/roa-nov19🤎We are undoubtedly living in a world of chaos where our collective and individual grief stays locked up within us at all times.🤎Grief manifests in many forms, some of which are brushed off as social norms. We shy away. We pretend to move on while the grieving process goes unattended, leaving a huge void that needs healing. We must understand that grief is not limited to losing a loved one.🤎Do you miss your pre-pandemic life? Do you struggle with relationships, belonging, and/or identity? These are some of the experiences that cause us to grieve.🤎"Re-Presenting Our Ancestors: A Grief Ritual."Saturday, Nov 19th, 2022 @ 3pm Eastern / 8pm UKRegister here: bit.ly/roa-nov19🤎#RePresentingOurAncestors #RePresentingOurStories #Grief #Ancestors #AncestralWisdom #Death #AncestralHealing #Connection #Healing #Generations #Grief #Loss #LovedOnes #Trauma #Sorrow #Depression #Sadness #Belonging #Home #Roots #Immigrant

The permanent loss of someone you love is worth about three days to big business.With the expectation you come back to work ready to work.And don’t bring your personal life into this.There’s no crying in corporate.Even though we get our “healthcare” benefits through our jobs.There’s a disconnect.Because even though your world will never be the same, the message we’ve been told since day 1 is to keep going.Heartbreak isn’t a good enough reason to pause.Be human.But outside of working hours, please.Our grief is the most natural response to any loss.What’s unnatural is being told that our grief cannot and should not be expressed in a place where people spend the majority of their life.I started my business because I was fed up with the lack of humanity in the workplace.And now, through this work, I help my clients process their grief which gives them choices of what they want to do next.Some are looking to enhance their emotional regulation so that regardless of the chaos at work, they are calm and centered.Others channel their grief into doing something completely different with their lives.What’s your ultimate result?If you are tired of avoiding your feelings and want emotional health support, let’s chat.Shutting down your feelings is not only harmful to yourself, but it creates more problems in your relationships.I’m here to show you how to not abandon yourself for the sake of other people and institutions.#grief#corporate#bereavement#emotionalintelligence#humanity#healing#lifecoach #business #work #jobs #people #healthcare #health #love #help #workinghours

When we go through a healing process, the results can be extremely rewarding. We are now able to let go of our pain, and experience life in a more profound way. However, experiencing this new life can also cause us to be sad for the time that we spent in our unhealed state. While we can be compassionate and patient with ourselves, we can also be honest about the things that we may have missed out on as a result of being wounded. That is a loss that we can also grieve.#grief #griefrecovery #gratitude
-----------------------------
Although we try and live with a strategy in mind, planning how many children we want or the house we need, within all of this, there is no immunity from loss.When we realize that material things are fleeting collections of wants and will not sustain us in tragedy, we begin to embrace the little moments of life.Giving of ourselves is the most valuable offering we can present, shaping the world in a perfect light. A beautiful sunrise, a child’s laughter, even the smile we bring the elderly neighbor when we stop to visit will be the pause that will anchor us if our ship begins to sink.#productivity #survival #funeral #grief Ashley Hoskins Otto Briede #planning #strategy Annette Willett Online Funeral Templates Olathe Chamber of Commerce Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce The Ohio State University

WATCH NOW! 👀In this new episode, let's learn how traumatic darkness can be transformed into your own superhero. 💪An inspiring story from Mike Hynes, an executive coach and the author of The Myth-Guided Mind: How to Unleash Your God-Given Genius at Work and at Home. As a former therapist, he learned that life can be brutal. Michael himself was broken by life when his uncle was killed in a funeral attack. That marked the beginning of his journey to becoming a healer and being a catalyst for people to get past their worst days and wake up to the best day ever.  ✨ TIPS ON HOW TO OVERCOME TRAUMA ✨1. Find healthy ways to connect: People, pets, nature, museums, live music, sports2. Learn to connect to your breath, posture, and meditation or deep listening3. Be brave. Healing can be very hard. If committing to put on socks is all you can manage, do it and celebrate that you're out of bed and on your way to getting dressed.Link 👉 https://lnkd.in/gMvT_sKR#trauma #traumahealing #healer #meditation #mindfulness #anxiety #depression #grief #loss #mentalhealth #selflove #love #inspiration #alcohol #addiction

I was in an awakening and realized I had to start putting the same energy into myself that I was putting into everyone and everything around me. It wouldn't be until years later that I actually started practicing this quote.

30 Years ago I created the HigherVision Collection. A series of poems and lithographs in memory of my son Lee who drowned in 1986. This series was inspired by a vision I had when he died and passed to the other side. In a golden glow of light I was blessed with a message and image of Christ, I was not alone. And I am here to pass on the same message within my story. You are not alone. We are all connected through a divine light.Poetry has been a source of healing for me since I was a little girl. At 11 I was given a poetry book and from there, I was hooked on words, verse and stories. https://lnkd.in/gSyBhMxa#poetry #Highervision #grief #loss #love #healing #endofthetrail #light

Be a should-detective in your grief.Should is often a very lousy and very misdirected voice in our heads in our #grief. It carries the voices of our grief-illiterate culture, inviting us to judge ourselves for our experiences of grief instead of offering ourselves compassion.So, I’m inviting you to be a should-detective in your grief.

Heavy financial loss can lead to feelings of distress and grief. Moving on mentally and emotionally can be difficult, but here are tips to make recovery easier.#grief #loss #mentalhealth
-----------------------------
https://lnkd.in/dm4dcfsrIn the West, death has become medicalized, institutionalized, and sterilized during the past century. Death is concealed behind closed doors and out of sight, which makes this obvious. We rarely have a plan in place for when it occurs because we rarely see it, discuss it, or think about it. Communication about death is mistakenly seen as morbid, sad, or hastening death.Early traumatic events involving death or the death of a loved one could be specific thanatophobic triggers. Although being unwell is not a need for someone to feel this fear, having a serious illness may make a person more likely to experience thanatophobia since they are afraid of dying. It's a relatively complicated phobia. Many, if not most, people are afraid of dying—some fear being dead while others are afraid of the actual act. However, if the fear is so prevalent as to affect your daily life, then you might have a full-blown phobia.#georgenagrace #georgenagraceyoutube #grief #griefguide #phobic #USdeathphobic #conversation #traumaspecialist #whyarepeopleintheusdeathphobic #bodytellthetruth #body #truth #intelligentgriefyoutube #pandemic #pandemicovid19 #pandemic2020 #pandemictimes #pandemiclife #pandemiclifeinsights #listening

Just wow! What wise and beautiful words.For me this sentence stands out, but honestly it was hard to choose.  'The messages from our heart, mind, body and soul are communicated through the doorway of suffering and joy'.And have you ever wondered  'how you might wish to have lived your life differently'? I know after losing my husband I have chosen to be more intentional with how I want to live my life.#choice #grief #griefcoach #wisdom #selfawareness

My son, Isaac, died 14 years ago today.He was 3 days old and the twin to my daughter, Lily.I don't tell you this to garner sympathy or create sadness.I share this because I believe that we should be able to talk about those we loved and lost and to share our grief stories.Grief should not be considered something that we hide from others, just because it can be uncomfortable to talk about and make both ourselves and others feel vulnerable.Everyone experiences grief in one way or another throughout their lifetime.  If anything, it is the one thing we all have in common.And it changes us, whether we want it to or not.We are never the same after grief - nor should we be.  Like every experience we have in life, we are changed by these experiences and grow from them.It's the same with grief.Grief lives inside of us and becomes a part of who we are now.It is how we choose to face it and incorporate it into our lives that determines what our future looks like.It takes courage and a desire to move forward.And it is hard as hell to do.It is lonely work.It is emotionally draining.And only we can choose our path forward.For me, I would not be where I am today if I had not lost Isaac.  His loss catapulted me into the world of grief where I learned that there is so much the world doesn't know nor talk about when it comes to grief.Now, I work to educate people about grief and to support those women going through it (no matter their loss), helping them to figure out who they are now and who they want to be through 1:1 coaching or within my "Becoming an Empowered Grief Warrior" workshops.Grief is a journey with lots of ups and downs along the way and is one that is easier when you have someone by your side - if only to sit silently beside you.For anyone who is grieving, know that you are not alone.  And if you are looking for support in figuring out how to move forward, please reach out.  I am here to help.I love my son dearly and think of him every day.  He is part of me and I wouldn't have it any other way.#evolvcoaching #grief #loss #lifecoach #lifecoaching #griefcoach #movingforwardaftergrief

After losing my mom last year I feel especially inspired and comforted by the traditions of Dia de los Muertos.While wanting to be respectful that I myself am not Mexican, I am giving myself space to learn about this holiday and it’s providing some balm for my grieving heart. So I wanted to share a little bit about it here.Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a holiday celebrated in Mexico, and by people of Mexican heritage living in other places, such as the United States.It is acknowledged on November 1st and 2nd. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and joyfully celebrate loved ones who have died.If you are grieving, hurting and missing someone or even multiple people... You’re not alone.Happy Día de los Muertos!What’s one thing you celebrate about the beloved you are missing?#diadelosmuertos #dayofthedead #wellbeing #growth #griefjourney#griefrecovery #griefandloss #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness#grievingdaughter #captureyourgrief #griefshare #loveandloss #love#healingjourney #bereavement #imissyou #memories #traumahealing#grief #healing #marnaschwartz #coachmarna #lifecoach #healthcoach#personaldevelopmentcoach #iloveyoumom

The Grief Recovery Method teaches the small and correct steps which allow us to identify, process, and release the pain of past, unresolved experiences and relationships.We have been taught to ignore our negative emotions, to stay busy, to distract ourselves, and to bury them.We have been taught “out of sight, out of mind” but nothing could be further from the truth.Our painful memories, left unresolved, do not go anywhere until they are faced. The key, that unlocks our emotional prison, is found in facing our pain and mending our broken heart.It is our intellectual mind that convinces us, and others, that we are just “fine”.Our heart speaks a much different language. Our heartache needs to be identified, completed, and witnessed in order to be released.The freedom we are seeking is found in the pain we are carrying.So many people who have completed the Grief Recovery Method program with me are surprised with what the experience offered.Many of shared with me:😊 “I didn’t expect a grief program to be like this”. 😊 “I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did while I was in a grief program”. 😊 “I didn’t think that something this simple could work so quickly.”It works because it is the correct process 😉So when you are tired of trying to paint a room with a screwdriver, and you are ready to release the pain of your past, let’s chat…Tammy AdamsAdvanced Grief Recovery Method Specialisttdadams@rogers.com(best way to reach me)http://tadams.ca #grief #griefsupport #griefrecovery #motivation #education #leadership#inspiration #personaldevelopment #growth #empowerment #health #mentalhealth #happiness #support #onlinesupport

Over the last 10 years, grief has been a frequent visitor as it is with all of us as we get older, as it has with many during this pandemic. I’m still working through the grief of losing a good friend suddenly. He was a homeless man with schizophrenia living at a bus bench when we first met. I became his advocate and week in and week out for several years I helped him. Soon after he got permanent housing, he died from an overdose. I’m still shook and feel like one of my arms got pulled off of my body never to return. I’ve had to relearn how to reach out, to believe in my abilities. This episode of the podcast let me have another big cry I needed. Give it a listen. I miss ya Phil. I’m trying like hell to understand and go forward, to not choose guilt or shame or fault. But to know that feelings must be allowed to flow. #grieving #grief #homelessadvocate #directoutreach #andersoncooper #notalone #fullerton #downtownfullerton #kellyscorner #authenticity #emotions #processing #empathlife #allthereiswithandersoncooper #homelessness #compassion #vulnerability #reallife

Coming tomorrow!The full interview - Grief and Rebirth Podcast promo trailer: https://zcu.io/vnEW ....#thegriefspecialist#griefcounseling#therapy#grief#hope#podcast#interview

I love listening to podcasts. There’s a wealth of information, views and experiences being shared and I think that we can learn a huge amount (and feel less alone) when we hear other people’s experiences. It can also help us to normalise our own thoughts and feelings knowing that other people have been through similar things.Recently I’ve listened to two podcasts which have focussed on grief and loss - both interviewees (Richard E Grant and Rob Delaney) speak honestly and beautifully about a subject that we can all too often avoid. Here are the links to these particular episodes:https://lnkd.in/e6UwmSM5https://lnkd.in/ezqj_zKU #grief #howtofail #happyplace #podcast #loss #bereavement #mentalhealth

Robert Augustus Masters: "That's something that came out of the 5-methoxy-N experiences; I started to feel far more intimate with life, my experience... everything."This week, Roger Walsh and John Dupuy, MA interview Robert Augustus Masters, PhD, a psychospiritual guide and trainer with a doctorate in psychology. He’s also the author of many books including Transformation Through Intimacy, Spiritual Bypassing, Emotional Intimacy, To Be a Man, and Bringing Your Shadow out of the Dark and the audio program Knowing Your Shadow. His intuitive, uniquely integral work blends the psychological and physical with the emotional and spiritual, with an emphasis on full-blooded awakening, emotional authenticity and literacy, deep shadow work, and the develop­ment of relational maturity. At essence, his work is about becoming more intimate with all that we are, in the service of the deepest possible healing, awakening, and integration.Full podcast episode drops TOMORROW, Thursday, at 5 AM US Eastern Time.Visit our website to subscribe and get notified of new podcast episodes!Transcript:I want to bring in the concept of intimacy here because with intimacy, you get very close to the subject, the person, the state of mind, this physical state you're in... But, you don't fuse with it. There's a subtle distance. And that allows for more clarity.So, my path, I would say, is becoming intimate with all that I am, cultivating intimacy with all that I am, all that is. That creates that small but healthy distance from what I'm observing, so I can keep it in focus, and I can read it more clearly.That's something that came out of the 5-methoxy-N experiences; I started to feel far more intimate with life, my experience... everything. I wasn't trying to be close. I just felt closer and closer and closer. And more curious like a little kid turning over stones in the garden. I'm curious. What's underneath this rock right here? What do I detect in myself here? Here's something that I tend to stay out of touch within myself is maybe my capacity for violence. What's it look like? What's my history with it? How well do I notice? It's becoming intimate with what's in my shadow and all the things I've tended to keep out of sight to varying degrees. #RobertAugustusMasters #SpiritualBypassing #Psychedelics #ToBeAMan #KnowingYourShadow #Awakening #Grief #HealingGrief #ShadowWork #RogerWalsh #JohnDupuy #IntegralTheory #Spirituality #SelfDevelopment #DeepTransformation #TransformativeConversations #LongformPodcast #Podcast #Podcasts #PodcastsToListenTo #SocialChange #CollectiveEvolution

"We never “get over” the loss of a child or any loved one. We will never finish healing one day and say, “Glad I’m done with that.” Instead, we learn how to grow our lives around grief. We learn to find meaning in our lives by honoring those we lost. And in some strange way, we learn that joy and grief can co-exist."https://bit.ly/3MIe4uX#grief #death #life #hope #healing #DuganCaringForYou

It might come as a surprise, but choosing inaction is also a choice. Many times, by postponing or procrastinating making decisions - we feel that we are NOT taking an action - but actually we do.This is one of the cornerstones of my Renewal In Action program: supporting students to take small steps to avoid inaction, and start regenerating TODAY, to avoid burnout!So next time you feel like you are stuck and can't move forward, instead of pushing the activity for later, you can choose to- pause- take a deep breath, and- take one small step toward your goal, without postponing it for tomorrow.This applies to any human activity, but is paramount for Givers, in order to regenerate and refuel our energies, in order to keep giving to others, without the fear of burnout!#selfcare #selfcareroutine #selfcarethreads #personaldevelopment #giver #kindness #kindhearted #lifepurpose #burnout #preventburnout #grief #selfcaretips #selfcompassion #griefsupport #healing #lifecoach #lifecoaching #abundancemindset #growthmindset #teamforthesoul

After my close friend died, I saw the show Fleabag, and felt truly seen for the first time.For the first time in my life, I saw a female protagonist struggling with grief after the death of a close friend, at the CENTER of a story. This is huge. I watched as the main character flailed through life, utterly lost in her grief, and thought: "oh my god. I'm not crazy." A thousand moments in that show I could relate to. But the line that really pierced me deep is when she said "I just want to cry. All the time."Representation is so important in media. It helps us reflect on our own experiences. It shows us we're not alone.#fleabag #friendsmissingfriends #friendgrief #friendshipgrief #grief #griefmedia #griefinmedia #griefsupport #griefrevolution #griefislove #griefandloss #griefandlosssupport #griefjourney #griefsucks #griefawareness #griefrecovery #griefshare #griefhealing #griefquotes

It was a Tuesday when I lost my soulmate. Our last phone conversation was brief about how stupid one of our friends was acting. Neither of us had much time, so we said only a few words. We made plans for dinner and each hung up.Less than an hour later, she was gone. Losing her was the worst experience of my life.The act of grieving is a slow process, and the worst of it often comes in waves. During the worst days, I learned a valuable lesson about how to cope with grief.One of the best ways to wrestle with your emptiness and pain is to get busy doing acts of kindness for those in need. The ache inside doesn’t go away completely, but having a purposeful task to concentrate on relieves some of the internal downward spiral.I’ve always enjoyed reading to the elderly. In the last 30 years, I’ve spent thousands of hours reading to those who struggled to read for themselves.When my grief was the hardest to face, I got busy again. I looked for ways to help others, and I did what I could.If you have a mental illness, there are days you’re limited in what you can do. With the exception of the worst days, I could still read. So I visited my older friends, let them select the reading material, and dedicated more time to making their lives a little better.A marvelous gift happened along the way. Several of my older friends knew the pain I was suffering as they had lived through similar grief. I read to them, and they shared their wisdom. I’m not sure I could have gotten through the worst of those days without them.For today, think of a kind act you can do for someone else. It can be as simple as sending a card or even a text message. Find one person today who needs your encouragement, and shower them with all the time and attention you can.Until next time, keep fighting.This story first appeared in the Speaking Bipolar Positivity Club.

Why thousands of people are opting for direction cremations.https://lnkd.in/eXwViK-BThe world is changing – more and more people are opting for a direct cremation rather than a standard funeral, and for lots of us, it makes perfect sense.Going for a direct cremation hands control to you, allowing you to organise the send-off that best reflects the person you’re saying goodbye to.Traditional funerals are great for some, but lots of people are seeking something more personal and flexible.Whether it’s because you don’t attend a church, or you just want to do something different, direct cremation gives them that flexibility and control.Whether you just want a service of celebration with an urn, a scattering of ashes or just a straightforward cremation with no fuss, direct cremation gives you that choice.Plus, it’s a lot cheaper – the average funeral costs almost £4,000, while our direct cremation packages start from just £750.#directcremation⁠#veneercoffin⁠#returnashes⁠#cremationashes⁠#sympathy⁠#cremationjewelry⁠#celebrationoflife⁠#urns⁠#love⁠#life⁠#cremation⁠#family⁠#ashes⁠#cremationurn⁠#grief⁠#deathcare⁠#deathpositive⁠#memorials⁠#keepsake⁠#rip⁠#memorialservice⁠#cremationkeepsake⁠#cremationpendant⁠

How is a direct cremation different to a regular cremation?https://lnkd.in/eXwViK-BA direct cremation is ‘unattended’ – you won’t be there, and there won’t be a service or anything like that. You’ll get the ashes back within 5 working days, and then you’re able to do whatever works for you.When you use Simply Pure Cremations, you’ll get the ashes back faster than anywhere else – most direct cremation companies will usually take between a fortnight and a month to get them back to you.#directcremation⁠#veneercoffin⁠#returnashes⁠#cremationashes⁠#sympathy⁠#cremationjewelry⁠#celebrationoflife⁠#urns⁠#love⁠#life⁠#cremation⁠#family⁠#ashes⁠#cremationurn⁠#grief⁠#deathcare⁠#deathpositive⁠#memorials⁠#keepsake⁠#rip⁠#memorialservice⁠#cremationkeepsake⁠#cremationpendant⁠

The changing of the leaves, the crispness of the air, and hot, delicious drinks are all reasons why this is one of my favorite times of the year! 🍁Be this as it may, it’s also a time of increased illness, feelings of grief, and a compromised respiratory system. Some of my favorite methods for creating balance during autumn, strengthening myself against contagious illness, and fortifying my lungs include:🍂 Intentionally focusing on slow belly breathing. A good ratio is five deep, belly breaths in and eight full exhales. 🍂 Releasing sorrow. Autumn is the ideal season to address emotions such as sorrow, depression, and grief. It’s also a great time to lay the groundwork for putting to rest those areas in our lives that are not beneficial to emotional health, which includes a non-stop work schedule, taking on social engagements that drain us, or even food choices that create emotional instability.🍂 Enjoying all the produce that is now seasonally available! These include apples, pears, plums, blueberries and blackberries, pomegranates, pumpkins and squash, and root vegetables!🍂 Clearing the clutter. Usually, we associate springtime with this activity, but I have found that autumn is a wonderful time to clean our spaces as it prepares us for the winter ahead.🍂 Using medicinal herbs for immune support. My Essential Winter Defense Bundle contains a powerful collection of herbal medicines that includes my popular All-Purpose (First-Aid) Salve, Bronchial Blend, Elderberry, Yarrow, and Yerba Santa tinctures, plus an antiviral/antibacterial Usnea Throat Spray.Interested in reading more about ways you can maintain and improve physical and emotional health this fall season?

Do we have a soul? Does it even exist? How do we even know? And does it matter? Is this even connected to our ability to regenerate so that we can keep on giving?Questions like these are not necessarily making the headlines nor are they popular in our culture.They do not inundate our social media, newsfeed nor our inbox. We can live for sure a comfortable life for a while, without even paying attention to them.But eventually, without paying attention to what might be happening inside our inner world, beyond our thoughts, emotions, perceptions and body sensations, many people reach a point of feeling disconnected from themselves, feeling exhausted, tired, even forgetting their purpose, meaning or sense of joy.Maybe "burnout", "midlife crisis" or the "dark night of the soul" are just some terms used to describe this.But what if the soul exists and it is essential to our human condition and to live the fullness of our lives - wouldn't we want to know it in our lifetime, sooner rather than later - before hitting burnout or get sick?In this first part of the series on Caring For Our Soul, we will start unpacking these questions, including HOW to discover and answer this for yourself.WATCH HERE:https://lnkd.in/gyiZMXUZ#christians #orthodox #orthodoxchristian #orthodoxfaith #christianfaith #selfcare #selfcareroutine #selfcarethreads #personaldevelopment #giver #kindness #kindhearted #lifepurpose #burnout #preventburnout #grief #selfcaretips #selfcompassion #griefsupport #healing #lifecoach #lifecoaching #onlineprograms #teamforthesoul

Cat care tips:-Being a responsible cat owner means looking after their health and welfare at all times. The best thing you can do is to make sure they have a calm, relaxed life, but there are a few other things to remember as well. Here are our tips for keeping your cat healthy and happy.Regular grooming and health checksCats enjoy regular grooming, which keeps their coat in good condition. Grooming your cat each day is a great way to notice changes in their health. Remember:Spot health problems early by checking for signs of injury or illness - and don't forget, cats have a similar pain threshold to people.Keep an eye out for behaviour changes - stressed or insecure cats can become unwell, and changes to their behaviour can be an early sign that something's wrong.Changes may not always be obvious, as cats can have different ways of showing that they're upset or in pain.Get it checked - if you notice anything unusual, including changes in behaviour or grooming habits, take your cat to the vet as soon as possible. Only use medicine your vet has prescribed - human and dog medicines can be very dangerous to cats. https://bit.ly/3MIjt4x #petloss #grief #petlosssupport #petmemorial #pawprintsonmyheart #petlossofinstagram #griefandloss #AngelAshes
