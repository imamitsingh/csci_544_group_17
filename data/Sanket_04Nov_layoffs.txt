Hi everyone - like so many others, I was impacted by the layoffs at #Twitter today. I am so grateful for the experiences, the growth, the learnings but most importantly, the people. Feeling so lucky that I had the opportunity to work with the most amazing, passionate and talented team. I‚Äôm open to work. If you have any producer or project management roles open at your company, please refer or reach out to me!  Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, or opportunities you can offer.#opentowork #LoveWhereYouWorked #hiring #openroles #Twitter #tech #producer #opportunities #layoffs

People are not mere numbers. Layoffs are hard to process and navigate. This is when leaders are expected to show up with compassion, care and respect. Your employees poured their heart into shaping your company. They deserve respect, even if they are being laid off. For anyone impacted- I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. My DMs are open if I can be of help. #twitter #layoffs #linkedincommunity #techcommunity

First, sorry to hear on behalf of the individuals affected and manner in which it's all been handled. And then there's the folks left behind. In one fell move, years of culture have been erased...and good culture has demonstrated business value. Sigh.Second, I can recommend openings at Yahoo; good people, support, and future. I have "some insight" into the Paranoids security team. For example, we're super-interested in a mobile security SME to own and drive some initiatives. How about a pen testing/automation expert or maybe devsecops oriented folk? Paranoids: https://lnkd.in/eaBDKTXM or theparanoids.comYahoo: careers.yahoo.com #security

I hope everyone is having a great Friday!Except for Elon Musk - I hope you step on a lego barefoot. üëø For everyone at Twitter (and anyone else experiencing layoffs/toxic work cultures), I see you and am sending you all the healing and positive vibes.  üôè While we often say we are more than our jobs and we shouldn't wrap our identities up with our work - it can be hard not to when we are so passionate about what we do and who we work with.Take this time to grieve the loss of your job, what you had hoped the job would be, what it could have been, and what you could have done there. ...And then celebrate the fact you don't have to put up with any more of their f*cking bullshit and now you are free to go somewhere you are actually valued!!!xoxo#grief #personaldevelopment #womenleaders #layoffs

Seen the Headlines? üëÄ Tech Companies are laying off employees...Have you been on the receiving end of a recent layoff OR are you worried of an impending layoff? If you've been in the workforce for a while, you know these cycles are common. Especially in an ugly economy.You also need to realize you have choices. You get to choose how you're going to respond to either having been laid off OR how you respond to the possibility you may be laid off.My recommendation is to "sharpen the saw". Increase your value by leveling up your skills AND increase your impact to society with your abilities. This may not stop an imminent layoff, but it will certainly make you more resilient after one and enable you to bounce back faster.*Views are my own#tech #layoffs #ThoughtfulTechy

On Wednesday I joined what's now thousands of folks who have been impacted by recent layoffs. Although my time at Chime was short, I cannot help but be grateful for all the experiences I had in my 7 month run there (shoutout to Kim Herbert for bringing me into the Chime team). I had opportunities to be part of incredible teams that were embodying the core Chimer value of Member Obsession. We tackled problems foundational to providing our members with safe and supported experiences. I got to work with an insanely talented design team (shoutout Ben Snyder, Jacqueline C., Daniel Klein, and Naomi Yung- you are all rockstars). I was able to partner with some truly phenomenal UX leads (Shreya G. and Jazmine Kohl- I loved the energy we had hoping into a call and collaborating to further drive UX excellence). I got to reconnect with old colleagues (Chie Tamada and Evelyn Y.- my rocks) and make so many wonderful connections across a variety of functions- too many to name. Lastly, I was able to be inspired by incredible leads (Samantha Berg and Terence Mascarenhas) thank you SO much for your guidance during my tenure. While it's not easy to process, I can look back proudly at some of the opportunities I had to optimize roadmapping, establish a new product illustration team, and coordinate our first ever Product Design Hackathon (shoutout to my planning partners James Sheak and Meijie Xia).   To my network, if you know any companies looking to hire in design operations or program management, please feel free to reach out. To others in my network who are finding themselves in similar situations, let's help one another- I'd love to connect and see how I can help. #layoffs #chime #programmanagement #programmanager #openforwork #designops #designprocess #dpm #designprogrammanagement #projectmanagement

For everyone impacted by #layoffs  at Twitter, Stripe and anywhere else.While such news is never easy, it is my hope that you will look back at this period and see it as a gift of learning, growth and better opportunities.When I was laid off from my first job as a Software Engineer from ETA Systems I was #devastated. I was the main bread earner in my family and had $1500 in savings.  This company was the only company that hired me because of my student visa status and had sponsored me for my #greencard. I was eternally indebted to them and would have worked for them for the rest of my life. They were a technology #startup company and did not survive. We were all called in at 6 AM for a meeting at 8 AM and all 2000 of us had no jobs by 8:10 AM. We were given 8 weeks of our salary as severance.We were in a state of shock and disbelief as we were being expected to be acquired.I was in too much of a hurry to find a new role.Within two weeks, I found a contract role with 3M  and within 3 months I was hired by IBM. If I had not been laid off, I would not have looked for another job and found success beyond anything I could imagine when I was laid off.Take time to decompress and enjoy this gift of time and learning. You will become more resilient and self-trusting.With a shift in perspective, you will turn this devastation into transformation.And when you are ready, look for a job as a victor over your circumstances and not a victim.. your skills are very valuable and YOU WILL FIND A BETTER FIT.Have trust in yourself.

Could @elonmusk have handled the layoffs at Twitter better?Layoffs are never easy and the way you handle them as a leader is a direct reflection of the culture you are creating inside your company.For Elon, he‚Äôs obviously a winner takes all, rip the bandaid off, shit or get off the pot, type of leader. The intent is not just the layoffs, but the manner in which he went about it.He‚Äôs sending a VERY clear message to the employees: things are changing around here and if you‚Äôre not a high-achieving, high-performing rockstar, there is no room for you in this company. Align with the new vision or walk out the door. Period.What are your thoughts on the layoffs and how Elon handled them? Would you choose a different way?

Again a super tough time for International Immigrants! üòû Stripe, Lyft laid off people, and soon Twitter will join this list too.To mention what tough times means are below:1. Our Visa gets into danger, we cannot stay unemployed for more than 60 days else we will be deported back.2. Financial burden, many immigrants have to support families, pay rent, EMIs etc, the list is never ending.3. Out of health insurance (if company removes it, luckily Stripe didn‚Äôt Lyft I'm not aware). Visiting doctors are super expensive, insurance is a must here.List goes on!Interview preparation, applying companies, getting calls, doing household work etc in midst of this pressure is difficult.I would like to call upon all my International Community to please comment down your details here if your company is actively hiring!Atleast this much we can do, we can reduce the efforts of getting an interview call for them. I know there are companies that are still hiring.Let‚Äôs work together and face this situation.Feel free to reach if you are laid off recently and looking for positions at IBM!Stay Strong and more power to you guys!#layoffs #techcareer #International #immigration #immigrants #painpoints #visa #community #hiring #people #work #interview

While I don't agree with the nature of the Twitter layoffs, it is hardly a surprise.To be clear, the market *loves* layoffs. Why? The product stays the same but the costs are slashed with the intent being clear: A return to profitability and a boost to investment funds. Add in premium offerings and it soon becomes buying stock.While the sheer scale of the product presents challenges and there is some significant admin policing a social media company, the product itself is ridiculously simple. Yet, they've been wringing their hands on adding an edit feature (a staple of pretty much every software product) since its inception.Myriad bloat has also been added which has improved the platform very little while introducing a number of debilitating bugs along the way.Twitter should really be leaving the competitors in the dust. Perhaps now it can.#socialmedia #twitter #elonmusk #layoffs #investments
-----------------------------
I've been laid off before. It's brutal.No matter how much notice you have, it can still be a very scary feeling. All of a sudden - you don't know what you'll do next, how quickly that will start, and what challenges you'll need to overcome to get there.Anybody in this same situation this week, please take a look at the open roles on Airtable's careers page: https://lnkd.in/gfpMyvUWe are in a unique position to continue (responsibly) growing following last year's funding, thanks to our current Enterprise success (lots more work to do there!), and considering our thoughtful approach to hiring.Please feel free to connect folks who may benefit from taking a look at Airtable!#hiring #layoffs

For your immigrant colleagues, being laid off is NOT the worst thing. Being kicked out of the country is.In the UK, after you lose your job on a Skilled Worker Visa, you have just around 2 months to find another visa sponsor (i.e. another job that will sponsor a NEW VISA for you) or, as Home Office puts it, "make arrangements to leave."üò± üò± üò± Imagine you have a life here. Kids go to school. You were planning to take on a mortgage.You have finally figured out how UK works, and, for some weird reason, you love it here ‚ù§Ô∏è (like I do).And now you have to "make arrangements to leave."What if you have NO home to go back to? Your country is at war. Or your country will jail you if you return.This stuff is stressful beyond words. Your British colleagues won't understand this, and good for them.I was in this risky position on my Skilled Worker Visa. I will NEVER be in this position again.Freedom and peace of mind are my priorities now. Moreover, I now help others make the switch to a visa that is not tied to any job. The visa that you sponsor for yourself. The visa where you are your own boss.Enter #globaltalentvisa üá¨üáß If you are in the UK on a Skilled Worker Visa, take care of this NOW. If you are laid off, it might be too late to do anything outside frantically interviewing at ANY company that will talk to you.

It has been a difficult time for the whole industry and so for Stripe. Unfortunately, I was affected by Stripe's layoffs today. I am grateful for the opportunity Stripe gave me and surrounded me with so many amazing co-workers. I am proud of my growth in the past 9 months - I worked more independently and efficiently and started to move like an owner. I became a team player and truly cared about others. From someone who was nervous about updating on standup, I ended up hosting a hackathon under my organization and no longer fearing to have my voice heard.I am especially thankful for the support and mentorship from --my manager Tamar Ben-Shachar and my coworkers - Christon DeWan, Piyush Narang, Steven Zhou, Kevin Liu, Dejan Gvozdenac, @mat, Sydney Walsh, Zach Puller, Ted Gooch, Hank Fanchiu, Bonnie Xu, and more.If you have any entry-level software engineer position openings (OPT two years + left, 90 days unemployment grace period), please let me know. This might be the journey of life and wish all those impacted the best!#opentowork #layoffs #stripe #softwaredeveloper #entrylevel #optstem

Early in my corporate HR career, I had a role in layoffs that were about to hit the company for which I worked. It was awful, at times felt very clinical in how the cuts were being made, but one thing was clear from the time the discussions started: we are talking about people that we were about to tip their lives upside down, and we must always regard these people with as much dignity as possible. The media has made a lot of comments about the layoffs at Twitter today, mostly about the CEO. Let's shift the focus to the people who are finding out via email whether they have a job or not. These people deserve to be treated with dignity.  Even if you cannot directly help someone impacted, connect with them on LinkedIn to open up your network to them as perhaps someone else can. If you're a recruiter, in HR, or hiring, add the I'm hiring frame to your profile picture to be a friendly face. And for those of you impacted, add that open to work frame and hashtag.#networking #connections #layoffs #twitter

Flexibility has always been part of our culture, even before we shifted most of our associates to a temporary remote work model. Now, as we step into the future, we‚Äôve put a hybrid model in place that provides a flexible environment for associates who split their time working at their home and the office. So why not explore a career with Capital One and discover how flexible working could work for you? https://lnkd.in/gX_WUB_A

Imagine if #elonmusk was apart of a #mergersandacquisitions hunt for a #cannabis brand? How would the public perceive it? #layoffs aside because that's already happening heavily in this industry, would he be much better than if #jeffbezos had free prime delivery with the purchase of an eighth or more over $50? The #cannabisindustry is at a critical point right now. The cashflow has slowed and major #celebrities have become the main attraction.How does that REALLY help the industry? i applaud Cresco Labs and Columbia Care for being a part of a bigger moment than just  #diddy now owning a huge chunk of reality in the #mso space. What this means to me is that now more than ever there is a put up or shut up moment. Will this REALLY help increase #inclusivity  and #diversity ? How will this #aquisition help the brand? Will the #quality be there? Will the #marketing  and #branding  be as on point as the companies that aim to the #cannabisculture? all this is yet to be seen. This move could be critical for #socialequity in the industry. On the celebrity side, if this works out with Diddy then i really wouldn't be surprised if #elon looks to add to his portfolio¬†#elonmusktwitter #corporate #cannabiscommunity #cannabisbusiness

I am glad Twitter REJECTED me a while ago It's sad to see all #layoffs Please remember a job does not define who you are, you do.Sometimes being fired is the best thing that could have happened; it's like a wake-up call that reminds you that everything is temporary and gives you the fuel to become the best version of yourself.Amazon is still hiring.Please email me if there is anything I can do to help you.I will share resources in the comments üëá

Tough times for the #tech community with massive #layoffs happening over the last 24h at #stripe and #twitter. This is just to mention the very last companies deciding to reduce workforce. Losing your job, the job you love, suddenly, is a draining experience and I still feel the impact this had on me when I experienced it.Might sound clich√© but when there is this kind of disruption, means something is changing. Job market adapts and new opportunities suddenly will be there. Potentially who was laid off today, might get a better, well paid job within the next months. The promotion you were waiting for months, years‚Ä¶. might be closer than you expect, in another company.Be strong. Will be better. Invest time in yourself. This is just a bump in the road. You are talented. You will make it.Feel free to reach out for tips and career coaching. Happy to help.

We are seeing a lot of layoffs by very large tech companies. I think something needs to be said that hasn't been (or at least I haven't seen it in my feed).It is VERY HARD to get jobs at these companies and these people were SELECTED.If you've never been through an interview process at a big tech company, let me tell you, it's thorough and extremely competitive. 1. You talk to MANY people on different teams (some you will never work with. )2. The process isn't quick3. Things can and typically do change during the process4. Some roles require a testIf you make it past all of that and get the job: 1. You have to quickly navigate this large company with language that is always unique to them. 2. Understand all of its layers and departments (and what those ACTUALLY DO)3. Then deliver quicklyThese people did that and were successful! I say this because WE ARE A HUGE TALENT POOL and this available talent doesn't come every day. As you plan for 2023 (correctly and with rock-solid forecasting), remember this and proactively reach out to these people. They are ready to work!#jobs #tech #tech #work #layoffs #talent

The constant (and increasing?!?) stream of layoffs is just awful. As a four-time victim ‚Äî and that's the right word ‚Äî¬†I have a few words of advice for the affected:‚ÄîYou did nothing wrong. ‚ÄîYou are good at what you do.‚ÄîSomeone else (probably lots of someone elses) WILL recognize the value in you.‚ÄîBe kind to yourself.‚ÄîTake a breath. ‚ÄîRely on your family, friends, and colleagues.If you're like me, you want to immediately start applying like crazy. (Family to feed!) Nothing wrong with that, but make sure your resume, cover letter/email, and any samples/portfolios are up to your standards.For ANY laid-off people reading this, I'd be happy to help with resumes, cover letters, etc. If you're not in my network, I'd love to connect. If you are, PLEASE go through my contacts and see if there's anyone I can introduce you to. If I can help in any way, I will.#layoffs #jobseekers

The reductions in force, largely driven by business plans that anticipated significantly higher growth than what happened, are hurting so many - in the Bay Area alone nearly 20,000 full time jobs in 2022 in tech have been lost as of today after Twitter‚Äôs RIF. I know my network will do everything they can to support our friends, family, and broader network in getting back on their feet. Who knows, maybe this will trigger a new wave of entrepreneurs as each recession has. I can‚Äôt wait to see what you do and create, please reach out if you need a referral.While all of this is happening, don‚Äôt forget that as a leader you have team members who are seeing all of this turmoil happening around them. Maybe no layoffs are planned, maybe you‚Äôre reducing cost, pausing open reqs, and halting travel to increase margin into CYQ1. I guarantee you the thought has crossed every single one of their minds as to whether or not their role is at risk.You may not have the answers.You may know with some certainty what is coming but cannot disclose.You may have some ideas but are waiting for a communications plan.This is okay. Think about what you want to tell your teams today, after several difficult weeks and then two very bad days for layoffs happening around them. Think about what you would want to hear if you were in their shoes experiencing the first or maybe second recession in their professional lives. If their second, maybe now with mortgages and kids. It‚Äôs a lot. Now more than ever, it‚Äôs important to keep the team focused and passionate about building. Here‚Äôs a framework for a communication to your teams:1) Acknowledge the elephant.2) Be transparent about the company position.3) Be transparent about what the company has done so far to stay the course.4) There‚Äôs a lot we don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt be afraid to say that. And this, especially this:5) We will get through this, it‚Äôs not going to always be easy, this is our plan to make it through this period of uncertainty. We don‚Äôt know everything and we will adjust as we need to. You play an important role.

Having spoken to so many people who have been affected by #layoffs, I have seen how it can be one of the more jarring and stressful events to happen in a person‚Äôs life.Some encouragement and advice I can offer from 11+ years of #recruiting in #media and #tech:üî∑ Lean on your network! For intros, referrals, references, resume help, interview pointers, even just a pep talk with your favorite old coworker!¬†Everyone has needed support at some point in their career and knows where you're coming from.üî∑ Offer to be leaned on! Helping others who have been similarly affected goes a long way and can keep morale up during a job search. Builds a micro-community. And being able to compare notes on how someone else is approaching their job hunt will keep you in an open minded head space as you go about yours.üî∑ You will find something! The job market remains remarkably strong with tons of great companies in #media and #tech hiring every day. Yes, it‚Äôs competitive, but so are you! Take your job search as seriously as you did your full time job and you will see the results.üî∑ Don‚Äôt take things personally! This is a tough one since we‚Äôre all the Main Characters in our story. Unfortunately, there will be rejection, ghosting, vague feedback, delays etc. You don‚Äôt want to work for a company that does that anyways. When the right role/company comes along, both of you will know it and it will just click.And always feel free to reach out to your Friendly Neighborhood Recruiters¬†üïµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I think these mass layoffs are a product of a broken capitalistic system. I could just end the post with that first sentence but let's also add that the Multi-millionaire/Billionaires behind these companies don't seem to be sacrificing anything to keep their people employed.There are very little protections for employment in this industry (At-will employment is the norm)... and although it's likely not a new idea (and maybe it exists already), it may be time for tech workers to unionize in order to prevent this type of uncertainty in the future.This is probably not a popular opinion but let's talk about it cause it's painful to watch my friends and colleagues get blindsided with layoffs. #unpopularopinion #capitalism #layoffs #future

#layoffs‚Ä¶This week my feed seems to be riddled with yet another wave of bad news for far too many professionals in the tech world.I‚Äôve seen a variety of takes on how the leaders of these companies prepared for their announcements:- Some with grace & humility: Stripe- Others with no dignity or personal responsibility to be found: yes I‚Äôm looking at you, -TwitterAs someone who was laid off just over 2 months ago, I resonate more deeply with the response of those employees impacted by them than I am in the failures of the leadership that caused them.So without further ado, here‚Äôs a few üî•hot takesüî• from my time being #opentowork:1. Layoffs rarely have anything to do with you individually - if you tie your personal value to your career, you are destined for disappointment2. Layoffs are typically a result of poor planning by upper leadership - choose your leaders wisely and push back on bad ideas3. How a company (or an individual) reacts to challenges can say a lot about their character - put yourself in places where you are valued most highly4. Your time is your greatest asset - be intentional with where you invest it. Find time for habits and practices that give you emotional, physical, and spiritual returns - especially amidst a tiring job hunt5. You are in control of your own path - if you‚Äôre letting someone else control your career growth or aspirations, you‚Äôre probably not growing the way you really want to (and CAN)To any who have been on the #jobhunt recently, what takeaways would you add to this list?

I remember at the beginning of the year when companies were stealing talents way around from their competitors - somehow it was sounding like a competition indeed.You hired Ryan and then three months later Ryan was reached out by your competitor with an irrefutable offer: double salary, double commission, double stocks package - and double work sometimes.Suddenly things changed and now we have seen many #layoffs  being announced in the last months, including big and adorable companies such as #Stripe and #Twitter.Something we learned from layoffs is that your performance is not an indicator if you will be impacted or not. There are much bigger things on the plate regarding a layoff decision about who stays and who should be let go.Now the companies are not competing against each other to steal talents, they are sharing the amazing ones who unfortunately were impacted. They want to make sure that Ryan still gets the job he deserves, even though he was laid off - not because of his performance.‚ú® So right now, for those who are still hiring: let's scout talents who were let go from our competitors. ‚ú®Today I got the list from #Wiseful with talents who were impacted by some layoff and I will share it in the comments below.
-----------------------------
I‚Äôve met so many amazing people here at Twitter. Each and every one them deserve the world. If you know of any open roles or your company is hiring, please let me know so I can share üíô

Twitter revoked login/laptop access of 50% employees today without prior notice. This is not fake news, Thousands of Twitter employees are now left alone with financial liability.  This needs to be investigated by govt authorities if that was actually needed & done as per rules and regulations of government.  These employees pays lacs of tax every year and deserve dedicated support from govt. Does This Violate US Law? #layoffs #twittertakeover

Writing a resume is a bullshit skill.It has nothing to do with how good you are at your job. It has nothing to do with your quality as a person. It has almost nothing to do with anything.What it does require is an understanding that a resume is an advertisement for you to get an interview for a specific job. It requires you to understand yourself well enough to construct a strong thesis about who you are and why you're a good fit for that specific job. It requires 4th-grade writing skills so that create a narrative through-line that engages the reader and reinforces that thesis at every opportunity.It also requires you to be able to "sell yourself" and your skills in a way that most people are very uncomfortable with.No one is good at writing resumes. It is not "natural" to anyone, and with the sole exception of when you need to write a resume, there's almost no opportunity or reason for folks to develop these specific skills.Funny thing - even a lot of marketing people I've worked with do not apply their marketing skills to themselves when writing their resume, which is bananas! And they should know how to do it.So if writing a resume is terrifying, and you don't know how to do it, and you don't feel like you're doing a good job... hit me up.I've been in a really weird position where a.) I've seen a ton of resumes, and b.) have spent the last few years helping folks work on theirs, and c.) seen a lot of that work result in people going from "struggling to get an interview" to "oh shit I got hired!" surprisingly fast.And I happen to really like the process of figuring out what people are good at and how to present it in an effective way. It's a strange little problem to solve.So yeah. For friends, totally willing to help for free. For strangers, happy to help for free, and when you get a job, pay me what you think it was worth (on the honor system)! If it turns out a ton of people take me up on this, I'll figure out a $ rate. But right now, just hit me up. Happy to help. Book time here: https://lnkd.in/gTt9-tyfIf you know of someone who could use a hand, feel free to send them my way. If I've helped you in the past, a LinkedIn recommendation would be appreciated!#resume #layoffs

The running theme this week seems to be layoffs.Professionally, my advice is to take a breath. For as many larger companies doing layoffs, there are 10 startup companies with funding, growth, and stability. Reach out to a recruiter, your old colleagues that may have leads, and utilize LinkedIn.My personal opinion? It will never be OK for companies whose executive staff makes a combined $10M+ annually with even more in company shares doing 50% layoffs. Shame. On.

The gravity of "50% of Twitter's workforce" kinda hit me. That's a freaking empty office. That's a lot of broken teams and processes. That's a lot of gut punches and stopped momenta. And whether it needed to happen organizationally a la creative destruction or whether it was an unwarranted sweeping brush effected by an imperatorial leader, there's no denying the scale of impact. And then there's the other layoffs .... It hurts thinking about this so I know it hurts like hell to be going through it. Let me know how I can help. Yeah, I'll treat to coffee, even lunch, and listen to you.

HR people have thoughts about the way new Twitter owner Elon Musk is handling a major layoff effective today, as comments on this post show. If a reduction in force (RIF) affects hundreds or thousands of people, is there a way to notify people that isn't via email, which is how Twitter is handling it? Did Musk fail to comply with California WARN regulations that require giving 60-day notice of a major workforce reduction? With multiple  tech companies announcing layoffs, it will be interesting to see what processes others follow, for better or worse. #hr #layoffs #peoplemanagement

Ethics and morals of startups have gone downhill in India with Increasing evaluations. what a shame !  #edtech Why should a  firm pay millions of dollars for global brand promotion and parallerly layoff thousands of employees in India ü§îü§îü§îü§î ?  Unethical and Immoral Couldn't those employees be sustained ?  Just for stats: Last signed deal of Lionel Messi for promotion of X brand for crypto coins was taken at USD 22 Million üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞ in March '22. Here he will charge for being global face of one of largest edtech brands , so one can imagine the fees  üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞ !!! A Sincere request to all those employees, HRs working in BYJU'S , before posting promotion of collaboration of BYJU'S & Messi as you are an employee for chest thumping . Pleaseüôèüôè post resumes of few of your colleagues amongst the massive layoff which have happened in last few months at BYJU'S  for help and atleast act to be a little more human.

Today: Elon and Twitter announce up to a 50% reduction in workforce (~3500 people)Stripe: Reduces headcount by 14% or 1,000 peopleLyft: Reduces headcount by 13% or 700 peopleOpen Door: Reduces headcount by 18% or 500 people The largest layoff in October was Crypto.com with around 2000 people. These are large-scale reductions with many other companies reducing staff thus far in November.

‚ÄúWe are grateful for your contributions to Twitter and for your patience as we move through this process. Thank you. ‚Äî Twitter‚Äù Totally agree Scott -- the absolute lack of humanity in this entire note crescendos at the end.  Of course, the only one left to have personally signed it was Musk, since he already let the rest of the executive team go last Friday ... but even if you were one of the lucky ones to get the @twitter.com note, how long would you really want to stay in this environment?  If this single note is a sign of the culture to come at Twit-la, I can't imagine he'll be able to retain much talent moving forward.

Tech layoffs will continue into 2023.Hate interviewing? (same). Here is some advice as best as I can.1) StrengthsAsk someone you trust what your strengths are.Write them down and be very specific about it.You're good at planning? When? Give me an example.Use this to frame your POV on what you excel at.2) IBWOTUse this framework when answering questions...- Issue- Breakthrough (What was your breakthrough in solving it? Did you have a specific insight?)- Work (How did you make that insight the solution? Who helped)- Outcome- Take away3) PrepWhile you're here, write down a few IBWOTs for the following:- Example of a time the team couldn't align- You were under resourced- A time you went against the grain/showed courageAsk interviewers ahead of time (honestly, just email them!) "Is there anything you'd like me to get prepared or think about ahead of the interview?" It's fine to come with a few warmer examples from your history if you can struggle to come up with perfect answers on the spot.4) BreatheDon't be afraid of silence. Be open to say "that's a great question, let me think about it for a minute." Take that time to calmly (breathe) leaf through your history in backwards order.Anything I'm missing?#interview #team #work #tech #planning #layoffs #layoffsandjobreductions #jobseekers

Companies (esp startups & new age firms) need to have a solid hiring plan linked to core business and revenues. Going all guns blazing during the good times will eventually lead to layoffs in tougher times!And if you're the CEO and your team has goofed up on this, it's imperative that you maintain the promise made to employees. All other things can be cut ( ads, sponsorships, etc) and layoffs should be the last resort to getting profitable. #Peoplebringprofit #layoffs #startups #hiring

Another day another Lay off !!! Here are the top 5 things employees should be aware of. If any of you are individual contributers at your workplaces, the law provides you some privileges. Ensure, you are given retrenchment compensation and retrenched in terms of your seniority. If you are managers, ensure you are given appropriate payment in lieu of notice.Return all the company assets promptly to avoid any legal action against you. Carefully examine the Confidentiality clauses in your employment contracts. Don't divulge any confidential information just because you are terminated. If you owe the company anything, payback promptly to avoid unauthorized deductions from your full and final settlement. Avoid making any derogatory statements on public platforms. #layoffs #twitter #byjus #labourlaw https://lnkd.in/grEcbWnH

US is currently on a "layoff-spree". With companies like Twitter, Warner Bros. Discovery, Affirm, Lyft, Chime, Hootsuite, Opendoor, Oracle, Gem, Zillow, Cerebral, Philips, Gopuff, Microsoft, GE, Pel√©ton, cutting its staff, there is a chaos of emotions amongst the people who have lost their jobs, the job-seekers, and even folks who want to switch to a different role. Having said that, Stripe sets an excellent example of how such a devastating thing can also be done in a pro way to assuage the loss. In this letter, they mention about Severance Pay, Bonus, PTO, Healthcare, Career Support and most importantly, Immigration Support. This could be a very critical piece for some of the folks working on a visa and have limited time to make things work for their next move.¬†Bravo for approaching this with extreme empathy and transparency!#layoffs #tech #opentowork #litrendingtopics #techcareers #techlayoffs #helpjobseekers #jobs #career #immigration #empathy

My thoughts this morning on #twitter #layoffs and how we all need to treat people, no matter what the situation as #human - we are human outside of work, we cannot treat people as not human when it comes to work related things.  This is all #employeeexperience and the #employee #experience will determine how a company is seen now and into the future.  How a company acts in these moments determines how that company will perform and be thought of for years to come.  Watch, learn and listen today as Twitter teaches us all how to, and how NOT to act in the #futureofwork Leapgen

Seeing new additions to the #Layoffs club and wanted to share a few tips for taking care of yourself:üë®‚Äçüíª Look away from screens! Many of us look at our phones and computers all-day everyday. This is an amazing opportunity to reset your eyes and mind.üëã You get to say "yes, I don't have work." Do things you've had to say no to because of work. Take the time to reconnect with people and do the activities you enjoy.ü§ï Give yourself permission to feel how you feel. This sucks no matter how you try to slice it. Scream, cry, laugh, and curse . . . but also blast some music, dance around, and remind yourself how awesome you are! (I highly recommend Lizzo üé∂ )‚úç Network and look for your next job, but don't obsess! Finding a new job is a full time job, so don't let it bleed into the rest of your life. When it's time to have dinner or go for a run, LinkedIn notifications can wait.You got this!

In the wake of today‚Äôs #Twitter #layoffs news, I‚Äôm reminded of an insightful Arthur Brooks article in The Atlantic titled ‚ÄúA Profession is Not A Personality‚ÄùWhile it‚Äôs cool to be proud of where you work, it‚Äôs important to ensure that the ‚Äúyou‚Äù outside of the company shines brighter than the ‚Äúyou‚Äù in it.  I have seen the hardest working and most dedicated people get laid off.  I‚Äôve seen people die on their way to work and get replaced in days (true story, and super sad).  I‚Äôve also seen people who left early, took their vacay and never participated in a single ERG or company event move up the ladder because their work was undeniably top notch.Before you were a #Tweep or a Googler or whatever else your company uses to define employees, you were a human.  And you‚Äôll still be one after you leave.In the article, the author asks readers to ask themselves the questions below:Is your job the biggest part of your identity? Is it the way you introduce yourself, or even understand yourself?Do you find yourself sacrificing love relationships for work? Have you forgone romance, friendship, or starting a family because of your career?Do you have trouble imagining being happy if you were to lose your job or career? Does the idea of losing it feel a little like death to you?If you answered affirmatively to any or all of these (2 yrs ago, my answer was yes to nearly all), he invites you to employ two practices can help you reassess your priorities (read the article for more‚Ä¶).Don‚Äôt get me wrong, participating company culture isn‚Äôt a bad thing.  But we shouldn‚Äôt be more proud of where we work than who we are as humans - even if we work somewhere super cool. #career #people #balance #happiness #workculture

I‚Äôm pissed off about these layoff announcements. I have witnessed some of the most irresponsible decision-making. Extravagant spending. Absurd expense accounts. Multiple millions of dollars thrown out the window for failed projects. And when it comes to the people, humans with bills, mortgages, children, aging parents who give up their time to help companies make profit ‚Äî they‚Äôre dispensable.Trim the fat. Tell them over email. But make sure those in our inner circles are taken care of.

Today has been a hard.  There's no other word to describe it.  It's hard to wake up & hear your company is experiencing a 14% reduction in workforce, especially seeing your direct team impacted.  It's hard for leadership, to make such a decision that they know will bring tears to their org.  It's hard for the employee's who are impacted, to have to take in the news that will impact their life. One thing that helps these situations is relying on our networks to help connect these individuals with new opportunities.  We've had smart, driven, motivated individuals whom I know will excel in their next opportunity.  If anyone knows of Helpdesk / IT Ops / Servicedesk / AV Ops roles open within their network for a Remote, San Francisco, Chicago or Seattle location, please ping me the details so I can refer some phenomenal talent!#network #talent #opportunities #hiring #layoffs #stripe#helpdesk #servicedesk #itoperations

I'd like to take a few moments out of this day to talk about layoffs....It seems #tech is being hit hard, but to be honest, most everywhere is being hit hard.  Loads and loads of people looking for work.  Whether you were #laidoff, #quit, or otherwise, I see you and I feel you!I've had a few awesome opportunities come my way, and passed on them for one reason or another. I've had people tell me I'm crazy, just take the job! Am I crazy? If you only knew me, knew what I've settled for in past jobs. Everyone should have the opportunity to move up, learn and grow and continue to grow their worth as well. All the pieces of a company have to fit for me and I was told by an amazing human once to, "Stop Settling!  He said, "You can and should get exactly what you're looking for!"  I have a beautiful home, warm bed, heat and a/c, food on the table - I am beyond blessed right now. If you're out there looking for a job, you quit or were laid off or just getting out of college, I see you, I feel you.  Don't give up, don't settle, the right job, the right company with the right people and right values will come along.  Know you're worth and don't settle!Thank you to Blake Wilson for helping me, for being a confidant, a friend and the most special and kind, supportive human - you're one in a million!Thank you Chris Pyeatt for helping spiff up "me" onto a white paper, and helping me figure out LinkedIn!!!Thank you to Clara Ma for being the conduit for all things #chiefofstaff - for keeping me plugged in and connected!!!

There is so much stigma to the words "laid off" to the employee when there SHOULD be stigma for the employer. You're clearly a business that has gone through hard times.May have mismanaged funds. Couldn't take care of your people!But we all understand that. We understand that things happen and that even the biggest and "most successful" businesses have had to lay people off. TREAT PEOPLE THE SAME WAY! üåüüåüStop treating businesses better than people, my friends. Being laid off is like being punched. It isn't your fault. It happened TO you.Frankly even being fired doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong.And you deserve grace and kindness and HELP, not judgement. I know many recruiters who publicly support people who get laid off, but privately look down on candidates who have been. Let's actually end the stigma. Really awesome people have been laid off. üåéüíïP.S. The Twitter layoffs ARE Musk's fault. Blame him. #kindness #help #layoffs #dobetter

My LinkedIn wall is flooded with posts about this week's #layoffs. üíîLayoffs are terrible. Especially when executed poorly, they can be really traumatic. Feeling for everyone impacted by these as your life turned upside down out of the blue. Please take some time to recover. üîã And whenever ready, just putting Virtual Internships on your radar. We are a remote-first edtech startup with team members in 30+ countries. Great culture and wonderful people.We are hiring across teams, and all the open roles are here: https://lnkd.in/eN4N2FQh. P.S. If you are a people professional and have dealt with layoffs in your company, feel free to reach out for support. üôè We should be here for each other, especially during these months that are challenging all of us incredibly.

My feed is flooded with posts about layoffs ‚Äî to everyone facing this, I send love & light. For those looking to help, please, remember to grant the same empathy and access to your network that you‚Äôre giving to those being laid off from big tech companies this week, to those who have been tirelessly searching for employment for months.I find that when layoffs from big tech companies happen every year, so much assistance is provided ‚Äî and rightfully so. What I‚Äôm saying is, lest we forget current jobseekers who‚Äôve been begging for help prior to the large wave of layoffs. (Both groups are deserving of assistance!).Here are ways to help people recently laid off and those who‚Äòve been in the jobsearch prior: - Boost the jobsearch posts: comment/like/repost someone‚Äôs post about looking for a job. What this does is amplify their post to your network. Their next employer could be in your network. - If it‚Äôs someone you‚Äôve engaged with/feel comfortable: refer them to either the company you work at or someone in your network you know is hiring.- If a recruiter slid into your DM with a role, but you aren‚Äôt interested: ask the recruiter if you can share this role with someone who is looking for a role/recently laid off. - If able, share your resume/LI profile expertise: review to improve someone‚Äôs resume and/or LinkedIn profile to enhance their jobsearch.- If that person has a side business, support their business in any way you can: this may help them financially while their searching for their next role.Jobsearching can be strenuous, let‚Äôs support one another as best we can. Each one, reach one!üíó#theBOLDjourney #jobsearch #layoffs

Earlier this week, I was laid off from MessageBird along with 50-100 of my fellow Birds. We join the growing ranks of those let go in these past few months. Thank you to those who have already reached out and shown your support. At the end of the day, it is the relationships we build that matter most and I am proud to know so many amazing people.And, while it is a bummer to have to move on, it is also a time for optimism and a time to reflect.üöÄ Reflect on my wonderful team and the accomplishments we had streamlining how we discover, build, and deliver great products to our awesome customers.üí° Reflect on all I have learned, the road ahead, and where I want to go next.‚ù§Ô∏è And, most of all, reflect on how lucky I am to have an amazing family who love and support me every day. This is us dressed up for Halloween as Woody (the hat was too small for my big head), Bo Peep, and a lamb!This week, it's been about relaxing with family and friends. Next week, the search for my next opportunity begins. Stay tuned!#layoffs #thankful #productmanagement #startups

2022 has been tough. 2023 won‚Äôt be better. Here are 2 goals I think you should work towards starting today:üéØ Get maximum exposure to opportunities, so recruiters and hiring managers are chasing you.üéØ Increase your knowledge and relevant skillset to make sure you are in demand.Knowing the right people is critical. You don‚Äôt need to stand in line and submit an online application like everyone else.I‚Äôve landed roles and received offers from Microsoft, Salesforce, Twitter, Expedia, Amazon, and Peloton without applying. Recruiters and hiring mangers found me.Here‚Äôs how.Build in public. As you learn new things, share what you‚Äôve learned on platforms like this. LinkedIn is the most power tool to get exposure to opportunities directly from recruiters, sourcers, and hiring managers.Remember that LinkedIn was created so recruiters can find you. Make sure you profile is attracting the right attention.Build quality relationships with people. Network and join communities like Mentor Mesh, and learn people across the industry you want to join. This is the best way to get mentorship at scale and will also expose you to more opportunities, sometimes before they even hit the job board.Research roles and understand that tech more than coding. Explore people-focused roles like product management and program management which may be able to leverage your transferable skills.I know this easier said than done, and there is much more to this list. We‚Äôve got dozens of stories within Mentor Mesh, including mine that shows the power of being in demand.Here‚Äôs how I can help you with all of the above.üìå Free Mentorship Sessions: Mentor Mesh does 1-3 free weekly mentorship sessions hosted by tech professionals across the industry, including myself.üìå Self-Paced Course: We just released a video course on Non-traditional Transition to Product Management. An affordable study guide that covers my suggestions above and walks you through the full lifecycle of building a product as a product manager. üî•On sale for 50% off for the next 24 hoursüî•üìå PM Mentorship Bootcamp: In January 2023, we‚Äôll be running our second PM Foundations bootcamp, taught by myself (10+ years in big tech leadership with no degree), and a dozen of other leaders across the industry. Part-time, 8-week live course, working with a cohort. üëâüèæ Click on my profile, check out the featured section to get a link to the free community and the newly released product management course.Feel free to DM with questions. Let‚Äôs make some waves in 2023. üí™üèæ #leadership #careers #layoffs #mentormesh

What a ride. After 9 years, this is not how I thought it would end, but today is my last day at Twitter. It has been one of the best experiences of my life and I‚Äôve met so many amazing people during that time who will be friends for life. For that I will always be grateful.It‚Äôs hard to explain, but #Twitter was truly a special place and the #oneteam culture we created will be hard to replicate. There are too many to name, but thank you to everyone who made it so great along the way.That said, if you or anyone you know is looking for a Sr. Recruiter with a passion for ML and helping build great teams, please let me know. #layoffs #lovewhereyouwork #recruiting #tweeps #opentowork

This is the email that Elon Musk has sent to all the employees of Twitter.It says you will know if you are layed off or not 12 hours later üò£#Twitter management asked it's employees to not to come to office,Blocked everybody's key cards,And said at 9am PST they will get an email which will tell them if they still have the #job at Twiter,Or if they are #fired  ü§ØAll this in just a week of Elon taking over Twitter I got to say this is the worst way to handle the situation,I would be absolutely trimatised and lose my shit if was a Twitter employee.Lost a lot of respect for #elonmusk after looking at how he is handling this.Thoughts?  #layoffs

I have a friend who works at a startup. Last week, HR invited her to a ‚ÄúHR check-in‚Äù meeting the following Tuesday.¬†We‚Äôve all been reading the news. In this climate, how would you feel if you got that meeting on your calendar?¬†Turned out it was a totally innocent touch-base. But it took a full weekend and two extra business days for her to feel confident that she wouldn‚Äôt be unemployed by Wednesday.¬†Pro tip: If you‚Äôre someone with hiring and firing power at your company‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt do that. These are anxious times, let‚Äôs at least do the bare minimum to make our colleagues feel safe and comfortable when we can. #companyculture #layoffs #hr

Hearing about layoffs in the tech industry that affect your friends and colleagues is always hard. I would encourage all those affected to take their time to think about their next role and look at what companies align with their values and where opportunities are available for them to achieve their goals!That being said, I recently joined Atlassian and it's been awesome so far. The company is open with no BS, puts customers first, and has an inspiring mission. My team within Confluence is growing, and there are some hard problems that need to be solved for us to help all teams work better together! For those looking for a new role and who are ready to take on their next opportunity, I would encourage you to consider Atlassian and this role!#hiring #team #tech #layoffs #twitter #lyft #stripe

Interesting week of layoffs.  The Stripe memo - highlighting overly optimistic beliefs that 2022/2023 would be as bullish as 2021 and growing too quickly to accommodate for this false belief - is indicative of what a lot of businesses experienced this year.  We are all in for a reckoning, if we haven‚Äôt already experienced it.  On top of this, ecommerce shopping will see real belt tightening by the consumer due to skyrocketing inflation.  I believe this will make the coupon, deal and cash back sites that started the affiliate marketing industry more relevant and important to the marketing mix channel than in recent years this holiday season.  What‚Äôs old is new again.  Do you agree? Sound off below if you have an opinion on the topic. #affiliatemarketing #ecommerce #partnershipmarketing #layoffs #tech #marketing

Another perspective of the current state of #layoffs...As someone who plans, designs, develops, and brands companies, often right from the idea stage or the startup MVP stage, I've seen so many folks now reevaluating what it means to be secure and fulfilled in their careers. I've seen supply chain consultants now go to nursing school and directors of HR now start their own wood furniture company; they've always dreamed of a career creating or doing the thing that made them happy.Please, to those affected, I encourage you to process your emotions whatever they may be. If a part of you sees this layoff as an opportunity to build the side hustle, company, product, or service you've dreamed of - let's freaking do it! I seriously cannot wait to build whatever it is you've been dreaming of.Whenever you're ready - I'm here: https://lnkd.in/gYwH9EHZwww.aretoo.designTake care,Robin#opportunity #startup #career #newbusiness #layoffsandjobreductions #design

What's amazing to watch right now is how Linkedin, one of the big tech platforms, is the central point of connection for all the other big tech companies/platforms, especially in light of the volatility. Linkedin has found a way to overcome being just a competitor and into a necessary tool for all.  This is one compelling reason I feel Linkedin is in a position to keep growing.  It is also in position to become a complete social media channel.  #linkedin #tech #twitter #jobs #layoffs #employment #advertising #socialmedia #meta #

Coming Tuesday, a mini-episode: New York City gets transparent on #pay for new jobs, and it's already messy. Also, mass #layoffs  and #hiring freezes are moving across the country. This week #newyorkcity passed a law that requires employers to share a #salary range for new #jobs. Is this a good step toward closing the #paygap? Let's see. #women still make only 80 cents for every dollar: Aso, significant #layoffs  and #hiring freezes are making their way across the country. Zillow Peloton Interactive DocuSign Lyft  and OpenSea  have laid off 5 to 20 % of their staff in the last several months. Ouch.

Elon is laying tons of working people off because he just wants to make Twitter into Reddit with a paywall.

Cause y‚Äôknow paying for free speech is truly freedom (eyeroll).Tell Elon if he ever wants to use his resources for some actual good I would help him do that FOR NO PAY OR CREDIT.

Twitter has been confronted with a preemptive class action lawsuit in response to Elon Musk‚Äôs alleged plans to terminate half of the company's work force, which would affect at least 3,700 employees. Musk has been accused of violating the WARN Act in the past at Tesla. He has an extensive history as a leader who flouts employment and financial laws, though his vision for Twitter is one that he prides on transparency and equity.
