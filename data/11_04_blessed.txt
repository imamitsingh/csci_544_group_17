We’re talking about race and racism. “The dialogues that we’ve had are creating a fluency. It’s creating this skill. It’s creating bravery and courage in different ways where people now say ‘hey, I want to be part of making sure that when I see something wrong, I say something and now that I know better, I will do better.’”

I'm very humbled to be the recipient of the EY 2022 Quebec Entrepreneur of the Year Award.  An entrepreneur may be the initial idea and vision, but the implementation of that idea and vision at scale requires an incredibly talented group of employees, loyal customers, committed shareholders and partners, and a collective of supportive and (super) understanding family and friends to see it through.  Thank you for all that you have done to give life to the idea and vision for eStruxture Data Centers and embodying what this award represents.#eoy2022 #entrepreneur #team #weareestruxture #blessed

MAKOSI GARDEN ROUTE - COFFEE CATCH-UPS The work culture at Makosi is something that our consultants thrive on. If I ever feel like I need a boost, having a quick catch up with our Garden Route Makosi family members always does the trick. Yes, we spotted whales and dolphins as we are blessed to be able to work wherever we want to at Makosi, but this resonates throughout the organization. It’s a breath of fresh air for our External Audit Consultants. If you’d like to join a company with a great culture for their employees, please follow the link in the comments section. #blessed#nowtheresroomtogrow

Two months ago to the day, I said goodbye to my CloudM colleagues (what a team!), after a fantastic ten months as Marketing and Dem Gen Director. And for the second time in my career (armed with everything I learned first time around), I waded into the world of self-employment. It feels good to be back at the helm of Start Communication Ltd, the boutique marketing consultancy I founded in 2016. And it feels even better, a real privilege in fact, to be working with such an eclectic, dynamic mix of clients - businesses and social enterprises going from strength to strength, that trust me to be part of their journey. After a whirlwind two months, it feels right to pause and reflect on how far I’ve come (us women aren’t always very good at that) and to thank everyone that has been involved in this journey, one way or another. So, thank you - there are far too many of you to tag but you know who you are. And don’t worry, I’ll stop short of saying #blessed 🙏.#fridayreflection #smallbusinessowner #marketingconsultant #womeninbusiness #microenterprise #manchester (Picture taken when I was onsite with a client on Wednesday).

#FamilyFirstFridayI normally don't post anything personal on this platform (in fact, I don't know if I ever have). However, I realized that we spend a lot of time promoting and celebrating others in business, so why not take a moment to celebrate those who are closest to us; our daily motivation to do what we do, our #FAMILY! Who knows, maybe we can start a new LinkedIn trend. 1st Friday of the month can be #FamilyFirstFriday. 🤔 🤔 With that being said, I really just wanted to celebrate our youngest child today. My Wife Benicia and I are extremely proud of all that she has accomplished, and continues to accomplish. She is a full-time student, in her Junior year, at the University of Oklahoma, and a full-time professional #NBA dancer, in her second year, for the #OKCThunder. We don't know how she juggles it all, but are #Grateful that she has the opportunity to live out her dreams, yet  keep school the priority. She is on a mission, and we are enjoying the ride! #ToGodBeTheGlory #Blessed #ProudParents

Here I sit at 6:00 AM finding solace in a quiet freshly resurfaced ice rink to watch my son skate.  There are several places one can go to find peace and quiet, but I've always found an early skate or early round of golf to be a couple of my favorites.  That said, there's something about this clean sheet of ice or morning freshly mown grass that always sets a great reminder for the day.  No matter what happened (good or bad) last month, last week, or yesterday; today is a fresh and clean slate. We are blessed to be able to face each day, and how we approach it will dictate how we fall asleep tonight.  Like I told my son, be the best version of yourself today, the rest will take care of itself!  #peaceofmind #Empire #truth #dedication #blessed

“What in the world did I get myself into?” - 24 year old me after seeing a Gas Turbine for the first time.Little did I know what an impact this career would have on my life. Almost 5 years around turbines now and I can honestly say that the places that I’ve worked, the equipment that I’ve worked on, and most importantly the people that I’ve met and worked with, have helped me learn and grow as a technician and as a person.

No matter what company I'm at, the story I continue to hear is the same. That story is that so many employees are given a title/role but that employee gets very little to no training at all but is expected to teach themselves or to search on their own on whom to contact for help! How do companies expect thier employees to be successful without the proper training or knowledge transfer?? It's sad to think about or hear of the number of great employees that are struggling because of poor leadership! I continue to get compliments from trainees that attend my training about how much they appreciate that someone is finally teaching them how to perform their role/task & how to use the applications that they are supposed to be using on a daily basis. #Blessed #Training #Maximo #KnowledgeTransfer #Consulting #BeKind #Compassion

So many people watch successful people and think they are successful because there is something special about them. They believe the uber-successful possess more intelligence or innate gifts, which is why they are not as successful. The truth is that there is more behind every great success story than you realize.

Was very pleasantly surprised today when I received this Building the Best Award from EQ Office for exemplifying the House of Yes practice!I've always been someone who likes to put their best foot forward and help others, so this principle has been one I've followed both personally and professionally for a good portion of my life. New opportunities, new people, new skills, and new experiences are big motivators for me, and being willing to take on new tasks and offer assistance in others are perfect ways to make those kinds of things a reality.However, ever since I joined the EQ Office family, and more specifically my team here in the Willis Tower Management Office, these principles have been elevated to heights. It's very easy to find the passion to help, discover, and participate when you work somewhere that offers enjoyment in all aspects of your professional life. I truly am blessed to be where I am, with who I'm surrounded by and interact with, and what I get to do every day. Thank you so very much. :) #team #work #thankyou #people #houseofyes #willistower #eqoffice #award #happywork #hardworkhappyself #blessed #blessedandgrateful #humble #servicewithasmile

After more than a year of its release, my book 'Unpause-India’s First Book of Cinquain Poems and Illustrations', has again made it to the Amazon top 100 Bestsellers (Poetry) list in the esteemed company of some of my favourite legends like Rumi, Gulzar, Emily Dickinson, Tagore, Kaifi Azmi, Javed Akhtar, Shakespeare, Jaun Elia, Bashir Badr, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, Rahat Indori, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Nida Fazli, Sahir Ludhianavi, William Wordsworth, Kahlil Gibran, Pablo Neruda, Kabir, Ahmed Faraz, John Milton and others. This is a very coveted category to be listed in without the support of any giant publishing house, because the all time classics reserve the top spots always. The algorithms say poems are read and loved without barriers and I am truly grateful to each reader for your love and unending support that has brought me so far.

Daily Affirmation: I am the righteousness of GodWhat this means to me: I am free - That the burden of any wrongdoing has been cast off. Too often I have lived life from the state of failure, that I somehow I need to overcome all the inadequacies to be good for today, but that’s not the case. When God says that He “renews His mercies each day” Lamentations 3:22-23, He’s literally hitting the reset button on whatever happened the day before. Today is new day - a new opportunity or plethora of opportunities to live life out of who God has called us to be. We need only look at the life of Samson to see what God can do when we turn the page so to speak. He was given a calling to be a protector over Israel, but at every turn was acting like an immature child. It’s only once he was bound, blinded, and made a mockery of before the Philistines that he humbled himself and said more or less “God if you will give me one more shot to do right, then I will”. God seen the condition of his heart and made Samson’s last act, the greatest of them all. No we can’t erase all the things that have gone wrong but we can trust God that He will make “all things work together for good for those that love Him” Romans 8:28. Just a reminder: the Greek word for all - it means all. Not just some. Have a great day y’all!#dailyaffirmations #blessed #blessedtobeablessing

Life is good! "Fresh of the Military Press!" Was my motto when I introduced myself to some great professionals during a veteran event with panel members that work for some awesome companies in the #dfw area. I also wore some of my well earned #militaryunit lapel pins.... not to boast or to say "look at me," but in the hopes that it would garner some inquiry.... to which it did.  This allowed me to work on my personal pitch and #tellingmystory. Overall, I received some super positive interactions and good conversation. The best thing of all was when one person told me "You are getting an offer soon, you bring so much talent and a positive attitude and passion about people." Boy, did my intrinsic motivation and sense of purpose elevate! I also got great feedback about one thing I never considered: "Tell us something personal about yourself."  I actually never thought about it that way in order to open dialogue and further add to #tellingmystory. I decided to tell a very personal thing about me which isn't a great perception for a retired Infantry Command Sergeant Major! I said I like Lifetime and Hallmark Christmas Movies! There! I said it, cant take it back, won't take it back! I also said I love substituting with elementary kids from K-5. As a learning and development specialist I am doing this to give back to our youth, but also understand the educational grouped social dynamics between Pre-k - 3rd Grade; 4th -6th Grade; and 7th-8th Grade. There is a difference and each group brings a whole now opportunity for me to observe, understand, and apply my knowledge to increase my ability to improve my passion: Learning & Development. So far I have been given some paperclip bracelets, a drawing of me as "Bad Bunny," I'm the BFF of two different kindergarten and 1st grade scholars from #uplift #idea #Kokua schools, and been told "Mr. A you're cool man, can you come back tomorrow!" I want to thank #ubs #epsilon #southwestairlines #mcafee #statefarm #fossil for the collaboration opportunity. A special Thanks to Benjie Esguerra AWMA® facilitating this event and Maria Hamelers and #fourblock for telling me about it! Veterans in Transition #ViT is an awesome group in the DFW Area that invites active duty and veterans to this event, but most of all it allows you to demonstrate your pitch skills, ask questions, dialogue and ask hiring managers some pretty tough questions! #Blessed #Veteran #learninganddevelopement #instructionaldesign #leadershipdevelopment #friendships #mentorships

Sometimes in life’s many pursuits we focus so much on completing a certain goal, achievement and success, at times with great cost and heartache, that we miss what our actual goal was supposed to be. We’ve all heard the phrase, “it just wasn’t meant to be.” This phrase is not the best mindset or perspective because it seems so final, and it can be. This phrase also speaks to not achieving your goal, or failure. Let’s say you actually hit your goal and achieve success . Okay, great! Now what?If we focus only on the outcome we can miss out on the real goal…what has happened on the inside of us. It’s a term I like to call “Inside Up,” meaning if we focus only on our goals, successes and achievements, even our failures, we can miss out on what the process, the journey and what life is trying to teach us on the INSIDE. We can miss out on what was really meant to be, PERSONAL GROWTH!So much of what we go through in life, relationships and business, has more to do with what’s happening on the inside of us, than the results on the outside. I’m not saying that not achieving your goal is without hardship and heartache, and yes, success and achievement has its rewards, but if we only focus on what is going on on the outside we miss out on what is happening on the inside. My encouragement is, allow yourself to be okay with the outcome and take time to reflect on how you have grown and learned things that you would have never learned or known had you not gone through the process, and allow yourself to achieve the greater goal from the “INSIDE UP.” In life’s many pursuits - SUCCESS is not guaranteed. FAILURE is not final. GROWTH is intentional. #goals #achieve #process #beintentional #achievement #success #entrepreneur #business #leadership #growth #mindset #journey #pioneer #perspective #reflect #lifelessons #gratitude #thankfulness #blessed

It's been 5 years and what an amazing journey so far! I've written 100's of offers, received 100's of offers, visited 100's of properties, completed 100's of transactions, and toasted with 100's of happy clients. I learned a lot of the business through volume. In this business, there's ALWAYS something new and interesting to learn. I'm positive any top agent will second that!I still remember my very first residential listing... (No agent will EVER forget their first listing!!)I was licensed 3 weeks before I secured my first listing in the Annex. It was a semi detached. The sellers told me the other agent was furious that they signed with me instead of him. I had over 40 people come to visit my open house within a 2 hour span. People were everywhere inside! Just madness. This part, I'll never forget..just so happened a thug walked in trying to intimidate me. He had zero interest in the home, just there to distract me and cause a nuisance. I quickly managed to lure him out of the house with some pastries.  Long story short...I ended up selling the house for $151,000 over the asking price for $1.750M. Setting a record which lasted for 4 years. The sellers had tears of joy - they were extremely thankful.  That was a moment in my life where I thought to myself this career is self rewarding. I'm going to use my skills and try to help as many people as possible.Thank you Remax for the acknowledgement and thank you to my family, friends and clients for your continued support. #5Years#Remax#RemaxHallmark #TorontoBroker #Volumeproducer #Labouroflove #Greatful#Blessed

I used to say…“I do so much work for other people and I never receive my flowers”“I get a ton of disingenuous “thank yous”“People don’t value nor appreciate me”But as soon as I realized my worth, started celebrating myself, and focused on ME everything fell into place.But more importantly, I shifted my focus from focusing on the wrong people, places, and things, and remembered my purpose. Your purpose will always create space for YOU! Your purpose will open doors for YOU! Your Purpose will get you the right acknowledgments and recognition. Your Purpose overshadows the lies, rumors, and haters.

The not so perfect smile. So, do you ever feel like you have a cheesy grin. Someone asked me for a picture (project being worked on) and I did not have ANY with a full smile. I very conscious of my not perfect teeth. As a teenager I had dental damage and I never got past it. I don’t have pearly white teeth. I have damage to one of my front teeth. You know the stuff we tell ourselves. So I put some lipstick on, grabbed the tripod and smiled about how blessed I am. #teeth #selfconscious #picture #pictureperfect #blessed #grateful

Sometimes we get the much deliverance that we need is from ourselves. Sometimes God strips us of everything we thought are dear to us to open our hearts to His power, grace, mercy and love. In October, my dad went home to Jesus, my cat went to rainbow Bridge, my son was hospitalized, I lost my job and I was sick with the flu. I am still blessed, I am alive and well. I am thriving more than ever. #love #blessed

I wanted to share something I’ve learned. ✨Life is not a race. It’s not a sprint. It’s a hike. ⛰It’s a hilly/mountain terrain of difficult climbs and linear walks. Because life was never meant to be a relaxing stroll in the park. You will have really bad days, but also really fantastic days. But it’s NOT about WHEN you get to where you’re going, it’s about HOW you get there.It’s about the things you learn and the people you are positively influenced by to become the person you are today. It’s about taking risks, following your heart and doing something you’re passionate about.Everything I have done up to this point has led me to where I needed to be. Two+ years ago I didn’t know where I wanted to go with my career or if I would even make it.Although, I knew what I wanted to do, I wanted to help people, I wanted to be apart of a cause that mattered. I’ve previously worked in the medical field, at hospitals and in a doctors office, so helping others was like second nature. I knew I needed to be in a career in which I could thrive. But at that time, I felt stagnant where I was. I felt as if I could be doing more, helping more and learning more. I just needed a pull in the right direction. That’s when Drift Net Securities took a chance on me. They saw potential in me where I seen little, since I had never worked in this type of industry before. They saw worth in my work, mindset and determination. Drift Net provided me learning opportunities to grow within the safety field. With the help and support from Drift Net and my fellow peers, I have completed two courses and received certificates for them from the U.S. Department of Labor! It allowed me to have the opportunity to grow within my profession and personally. I have learned new things, took chances, believed in myself, and, most importantly, I have been helping schools achieve safer learning environments. Because when it boils down to it, having a safe place for students to learn and teachers to educate is worth every minute I have. I feel every student no matter what, should feel safe while learning. So I will make every minute I have at Drift Net Securities count, because they are worth it.I’m not sure where I would be today if it wasn’t for Aaron Coles and Drift Net Securities taking a chance on me.

Today's Earthism for Celebrating Earth Day every day is for Detoxification and our daily newsletter is at https://conta.cc/3T1BWev.Have you ever stopped to think about what your divine destiny is?

Imagine being able to powerfully express yourself. What if you could really understand your true identity, vision and mission in life. Wouldn’t that be great?What if you could begin every day of the rest of your life in the highest possible state of mind, enjoying peace, tranquility, and self-assurance as you follow your vision, knowing you are fulfilling your mission in life. How would that feel? It truly is possible – IF you know how. The Blessism for Your Divine Destiny is a wonderful one to use to help you manifest your ultimate destiny.We invite you to take a few minutes after working with this BLESSism to meditate and reflect upon how it makes you feel.

It is such a blessing to be able to bless the Church who prayed me through my darkest times in life. Dos Olivos always stood behind me and took every opportunity to pray for me and my family. They even prophesized that I would be involved in full-time Ministry someday. I am now in full-time Ministry through the H-Town Dream Center . Now through my Ministry I am able to bless them and their congregation. GOD IS WORKING MIRACLES EVERYDAY!!  -Pictured: Pastor Alfredo Perez  - 3 yrs ago he prophesized that not only would I come out of the darkness but I would be involved in full-time Ministry.#fullcircle #OnlyGod #miracles #nonprofitlife #testimonialtuesday #blessed

I pray for unusual favor today. I pray that the Holy Spirit would touch the hearts of people you barely know and lead them to bless you. I pray that the blessing of the Lord manifest in your life today, in unusual ways, thru and from unusual people, in Jesus' name! I pray for help to come to you from outside of your circle. And from people who won't fully understand why they're helping you! I pray that by the end of the day, you have 3 or 4 testimonies of how unusual things, good things, and undeniably God things happened for you, unexpectedly and thru unusual people. I pray that by the time you get home from work, that you'll be fully convinced, that God still loves you, and that God is still with you! It's in Jesus' name I pray, Amen!Absolutely💯! #shalom #gracetowin #goodmorning #affirmations #morningmotivation #blessed

WHY YOU NEED MULTIPLE STREAMS OF INCOME 💸💸💸With as much uncertainty as there is with job stability in the world, it blows my mind to think that everyone doesn’t see the need for a second stream of income.  I actually prefer more than two streams, but at a minimum two is better than one.One of the biggest traps that new entrepreneurs fall into is endlessly trading their time for money.  At some point, you need to set up some passive income methods that share your knowledge around the clock.  This can look like online courses, funnels, membership sites, ebooks, and affiliate marketing just to name a few examples.One reason that you want to do this is to increase your overall earnings, but it gives you options if one particular avenue isn’t generating much revenue.  Part of the massive appeal of entrepreneurship is freedom over your time, but that will never happen without a steady stream of income.Here are my big takeaways for why you need multiple income streams:☑️ It’s fun 🥳☑️ It will increase your overall revenue 💰☑️ There is more stability in diversification ⚖️Transitioning from active to passive income will give you time back ⏰ www.wardmerlyslives.net#onlinebusiness #businessowner #bossbabe #grateful #blessed #ownyourownbusiness #ownyourtime #bossdad #onlinemarketing #fulltimeparents

I often say that the audio you choose in your content is as important as the content itself. It has the ability to connect on a deeper level. The other nature scenes I have posted (Instagram) received double the amount of likes @webbercontent Today the strongest trend in content creation is not always publishing about your brand and why your customer should buy your products. More than ever, it is about the way that it makes the audience feel about themselves. Ask yourself what content can you offer that will make your audience attract to you as a person and not a brand. This content trend will only grow stronger in 2023.#audio #contentcreation #emotionalwellbeing #2023planning #2023trends

What did Jesus do through a local business, in front of a huge crowd, to deliver his message...and prove His control of business success?Jesus took advantage of a common business tool - a boat. He asked a businessman who had been working all night (and was exhausted), if He could borrow his equipment to better communicate with the crowd that had gathered.  The businessman agreed to assist, stayed with Jesus until He was done talking to the crowd - and then was told by Jesus to go do some more work (fishing). At this point, the businessman became a little frustrated and voiced some resistance to Jesus’ desire for him to keep working. But, he relented and went back out to the deeper water, lowering the nets again.With the crowds still looking on - Jesus delivered massive financial success to the Zebedee Fishing Company. After catching nothing all night, the nets were now full to the point of breaking from the weight of the fish. Huge earnings, in a matter of minutes - in the wrong time of the day, when all smart fishermen knew it was pointless to go out and work. But with Jesus, nothing is impossible. In fact - He controls business success. He is the creator of all things. He is the owner of all things.  It’s His business and He’s the beneficiary. It’s all about Jesus! In an instant, Simon, James, John, Zebedee, the hired help and the entire crowd on the shore... THEY ALL GOT IT!Those who observed this phenomenon were amazed, and completely in awe. This kind of business success was impossible.  Nothing could explain it. No one had ever made that much money in one day fishing on Lake Galilee. Not ever. The great success awakened Simon to the message Jesus had taught from the fisherman’s boat, just hours before. Simon fell down, confessing his unbelief.  Jesus had Simon and his business partners’ undivided attention. “From now on you’ll be fishing for people!”  Business owner, FCCI believes God wants to work miraculously through you. He wants you, your employees and the output of your business to bring REDEMPTIVE LIFT in a fallen world, drawing sinners to Himself and speaking through you to deliver His message of redemption. Together, let’s pursue His purpose, for His glory!Visit https://hubs.la/Q01rx35t0 for more information.#christianity #jesus #love #god #faith #christ #pray #gospel #jesuschrist #hope #blessed #religion #prayer #community #inspire #devotional #business #leadership #fcci #businessowner #leaders #life #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship

🗣November is Youth Homelessness Awareness Month and it's so important. Because no youth should ever have to be without a home. Period. ‼️❓Ending youth homelessness may feel insurmountable. It may cause you to throw your hands up and ask, “What can I do about it?”The short answer is: “Plenty!”❗️And we have to do something. Every year, 4.2 million young people ages thirteen to twenty five experience some form of homelessness in the United States alone!❗️Every one of those millions of youth has a name, a life and dreams.‼️Ending youth homelessnes is a big endeavor. It’s going to take all of us working together. But with your support in raising awareness we know that people will take notice and join the fight to end youth homelessness.🕊Please consider a donation to Samuel Conaway’s and my team. Right now they have a sponsor to MATCH every dollar we raise!! There is no such thing as too small. We are sleeping out next week and appreciate all of your support!🙏#team #together #homeless #homelessnessawareness #homelessyouth #homelesslivesmatter #homelessness #awareness #november  # #people #donate #donations #donatenow #blessed #blessedandgrateful #thankyou #thankful .#giving #givingback

I chose the #restaurantbusiness it didn’t choose me. I chose to work long hours.I chose to not be able to go out dancing because I was too tired to do so or miss out on sunny weekend afternoons.I chose to raise a family while working 12 - 14 hour days.I chose this demanding business because I genuinely #love  it!I’ve learned a lot from being in the #restaurantindustry .I’ve learned tolerance, patience, empathy, compassion and so much more. I have learned more about myself because of this business then any lesson learned for someone else.This business has showed me that I have the strength to overcome many obstacles thrown my way, it’s taught me endurance, it’s released a sixth sense within me that I never knew I had when having to think quickly on my feet, to problem solve without hesitation and a lot more.I have so much more to be grateful for that this #business  has afforded me and has taught me, words cannot express the gratitude I have for the #foodserviceindustry . 🙏 ❤️ #blessed #ilovemyjob #restaurant #restaurantmanagement #foodservice #leadership #work #workculture #pride #proud #restaurantlife #hardworkpaysoff #workhard #lovewhatyoudo #dowhatyoulove #passion #goals

“No human beings are perfect, for God is perfect, eternal, infinite Divine love and supreme intelligence. Though when you become fully awaken to your true nature, and experience it within  every particles of your being, you realize how pure, perfect, whole, and Divine that you are. You vibrate at higher frequencies, and emanate light energy to all living beings. Knowing yourself is knowing God; knowing God is knowing yourself. Oh great Divine Mother, we celebrate you in the blue sky, the breezy wind, the sun rays, the clouds, the majestic oceans, the blooming flowers, in the sprinkling eyes of a cat, in the soft caress of a cow, and in the rhythm of our hearts. In our conscious breathing, eternally alive you thrive. We mindfully bow down to your flowing grace, and embrace you with profound gratitude. “ Shree Devi Mayi Ma 💓🙏#selflove #awakening #mind #truth #love #motivation #blessed #mindfulness #positivevibes #success #spirituality #peace #entrepreneur #compassion #happiness #life #hope #grace #spiritual #god #inspiration #happy #meditation

🐴 This is the story about the cute little donkey who carried Jesus on its back to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. 🌴 📝 The story was written by me and I also did the illustrations, which was different since I mostly illustrate picture books for other authors. 🌸 Inside the book you'll find that it has another story about the lilac tree also now as the easter flower, because it blooms every easter. 📚  Take a look on the interior if you want to, and let me know if you like it! Do you have any favourite picture books of your own? 😊 #picturebooks #picturebook #picturebookillustration #flipthrough #lookinside #book #bookreel #tiktok #donkey #cute #cutedonkey #cutelittledonkey #easter #Jesus #Christ #Theotokos #spiritual #spiritualkids #orthodox #orthodoxkids #blessed #blesseddonkey #tale #story #storytelling #kidlit #faith #kidlitillustration #kidlitartist #kidlitart #kidlitbook #angelikidelecha #angelikidelechabooks #angelikidelechapicturebooks #angelikidelechaillustrator #angelikidelechaart #angelikidelechaartist #angelikidelecha #work #printedwork

I always tell people who are looking to get into the #restaurantbusiness that it takes a special and resilient kind of person to be in this #business.It can be fun at times but many times it isn’t, it’s definitely not an easy business.You have to be willing to sacrifice more than you’ll ever receive in return.Miss out on holidays, birthdays, weekends, family gatherings to even not being able to attend a love one’s funeral, I’ve gone through all that and more.Yet I’m still here, it’s my #passion  that keeps me in this game!I’m currently at work while it happens to be my wedding anniversary. 💍 I always say, with great sacrifise comes great accomplishments.Happy anniversary to my hubby!#work #sacrifice #weddinganniversary #restaurantmanagement #restaurantindustry #aboveandbeyond #ilovemyjob #life #understanding #family #businessasunusual #blessed #thankful #grateful #happyanniversary
-----------------------------
The harvest of the sacrificial life. Understand that wherever you have light there will be a shadow. Over the last couple of months I've seen the harvest of seeds I planted along my way. As we go about our day. Think about being a light so that your shadow maybe able to bring comfort, peace, motivation, or inspiration to someone.

Market trends in Loudoun County are showing further signs of slowing down with active in the market homes down year over year and month over month. Homes sold are also down compared to last year and last month. Some of this is because historically, the fall market activity tends to be slower, but the bigger impact is the rising interest rates which are now around 7%. On the somewhat bright side, median home prices are still going up compared to last year and last month, but trends show the actual percentage increase is slowing down. Days on market are up quite a bit from last year but down from last month indicating there is still demand and buyers are taking advantage of homes that have reduced their prices. That being said, homes under contract are down, primarily because of interest rate increases and as a result, our months of supply are increasing as is our overall inventory. What this means: For Buyers: if you are looking for a deal, you may find one IF you can find a home that meets your needs. Plus, there are options for creative financing (in a good way) that will make buying a home a little less painful.For Sellers: you can still get a great price for your house IF they price it ahead of the market and ensure that it shows well by doing all the necessary preparation work before listing. We are seeing home prices stabilize but homes priced right are still selling quickly. Trying to "time the market" rarely, if ever works and if you have a need to sell or buy, having the right strategy for the market ensures the best outcome for you!As always, if you want to talk about your specific scenario, we'd be happy to grab a tea or coffee and chat!#MarketUpdate #MarketReport #VirginiaRealEstate#LoudounCountyRealEstate #MoveToVirginia#MovingToVirginia #NewHomes #HomeSweetHome #LoveWhereYouLive#15westhomes #design #loudoun #loudouncounty #leesburgva #homeiswhereourheartis #sold #closed #localrealtor #realestate #home #leesburgrealestate #blessed #nextadventure #realtor #dreamhome #virginia #LetsGetYouHome

🙏REFRAME 👉🏻 Gratitude is riches.

When you find yourself interpreting something in a negative way, or only focusing on the bad aspect of the situation, look for ways to reframe the events in a more positive light.✅ Establish New Patterns✅ Savor Positive Moments❌You see, nothing changes if nothing changes!
