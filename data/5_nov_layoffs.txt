"We have nearly 7,000 engineers, and all of them write C++ sometimes," says Vittorio Romeo, a software engineer at Bloomberg in London. "It's probably fair to say that we're one of the biggest users of C++ in the finance industry," Romeo adds.

Having been on both sides of the table, having been laid off and laying othersoff, I know very well how difficult it is to be in both situations.My thoughts and support go out all affected by #twitter #layoffs. It‚Äôs difficult to not take it personally but remember it‚Äôs not about you or your work performance. It‚Äôs about bad bets and calls made in the past by previous leadership, and quite possibly being made right now by the current (one man) leadership. Downsizing, upsizing and right sizing companies is inherently difficult due to market conditions companies act in, changing consumer behaviours,regulations and other hard to predict factors. To the leaders having to take these hard decisions, it‚Äôs wise to recall Robert Sutton quote from the book ‚ÄúThe No Asshole Rule‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe difference between how a person treats the powerless versus the powerful is as good a measure of human character as I know.‚Äù

I can vouch for Nathan‚Äôs abilities in any of these areas. If you need someone for a product operations, product manager, or program/project manager type role then take a look! He‚Äôs seeking remote opportunities or for something in Los Angeles. Nathan is a great partner to work with, and I was impressed with the technical skills he learned on the job to fill gaps on his team. Lyft‚Äôs layoffs were largely not based on job performance. You‚Äôre getting top-notch talent.

James hits the nail on the head here. Another thought, while many of the talking heads and experts are predicting a recession, just as many are predicting another hiring boom in early 2023. If it happens, and I really hope it does, there will be another mad scramble for talent...which will, yet again, drive up the cost of labor.

Will #twitter stop working even after so many people are laid off? No!Lean is GOOD. Lean is RIGHT.A lot of people hire a lot of people to do very little work. And these lots create artificial hierarchies. They slow growth.I absolutely support Elon and what Steve did when he gained apple back.A lesson for everyone:When you're getting hired, don't let the artificial narrative / PR of a company blind you. Ask your hiring manager and check his/ her depth of the company. The vision, the problems being solved.If you are not convinced then you are stepping in an artificially created jazzy story.This fable will end sooner.#layoffs

Instead of being mere keyboard warriors around the massive insensitive layoffs happening in certain organizations, here's something tangible that we all can do.- Boycott the offerings of those orgs > There's no point saying the layoffs were unethical or what the leadership did was unethical. Just quietly withdraw your support from the product/platform/service and let them deal with one less customer. Withdrawing support can be in the form of not paying for the offerings anymore, become inactive etc.- Help people who actually were asked to go > This can be in the form of referrals if there are relevant job openings in your org, liking/commenting/sharing their open to work posts, tagging them on posts where the authors are inviting companies to post relevant job vacancies, meeting in person (if possible) to provide mental support etc.- Make enough noise around the unacceptance of such opportunistic culture > Through your preferred medium like social media, word of mouth etc. make enough noise to condemn such acts. Remember, every authentic voice counts.- Remember the incident > In this era of information overload, it's often very easy to forget the bad stuff as much as the good stuff. One PR masterstroke or one influencer post, our memory of a bad incident gets wiped out in a jiffy. Hence, it's important to remember how a company treated its employees during tough times (recession, covid etc.) and lookout for red flags if you plan on joining such a workplace.I have started with steps 1 and 3 of my own suggestions. My firm belief is that times may be tough, but humans are tougher. May everyone who got affected by the layoffs see the light at the end of the tunnel soon!#layoffs #randompositivity

This is a personal post.The Twitter layoffs. The weekly news on layoffs all over. It‚Äôs fair to say that those of us who haven‚Äôt been personally affected know a bunch of people who have gone ‚Äúopen to work‚Äù on their LinkedIn profile picture lately.For those who have heard the news lately on the reorg happening where I work: I‚Äôm personally so touched by the messages coming my way. Nothing about my job or my team has changed at this point and I‚Äôm just really thankful for the number of ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù messages I‚Äôve gotten over the last 2 days.With that said: I know a ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get through, I‚Äôm sure!‚Äù message doesn‚Äôt actually help when you go through something like what Twitter is going through. So, whether or not I know you personally, I‚Äôd be more than happy to be a sounding board, make introductions when I can, and in any way be a support system if you‚Äôve been laid off lately. I‚Äôve also just recently joined the adplist.org as a mentor (big thank you again to my mentor Stephen Gates for getting introduced to the organization) and will be posting office hours there for mentoring time slots, free of charge, so I can be of any help for any creatives seeking guidance on all the things: portfolio reviews, interview tips, anything and everything in between.This isn‚Äôt much. I know so intimately the hell that job searching can be and I wish there was more I could do. I‚Äôve been there: back in 2009, after moving from Brazil to the United States, in the midst of the worst economic scenario and job market ever, with a thick accent and no understanding of the job search dynamics and with no support professional network, my job hunt was absolutely horrifying. It‚Äôs still a very fresh memory. It took me YEARS of to get back on my feet and recover from what that felt like.So‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre going through this, I want you to know: I see you. I hope you try your best to be compassionate toward yourself and that you find pockets of hope on your journey. And in the meantime, I‚Äôll do what I can to try to offer useful help‚Ä¶ because that‚Äôs the least I can do. ‚ù§Ô∏è #mentoring #network #layoffs #jobseekersupport

Absolutely this should be looked at and revised by USCIS and those responsible for immigration reforms. Technically it is not even 60 days, one has to land a job around 30-35 day mark to then allow enough time for paperwork and filing of H1B. Even with premium processing those steps can take 15+ days easily. And btw, in that period one also has to parallel plan what to do with their property, car etc. in case they have to leave. While i have heard employers have notified H1B employees in some cases ahead of time and set termination date in future to work around the flaws in process, 99% of cases employers don‚Äôt care!!! #immigration #h1bvisa #layoffs

The big business news story right now is the awful way that twitter's new owner has handled the downsizing of his workforce. This NY Times article (https://lnkd.in/eiCNA4RM) covers it well.Notice in this excerpt that the Communications team did not respond:"Twitter‚Äôs communications team, which was almost entirely laid off, did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment."How can your corporate communications team reply when they have been almost all cut?Notice in this excerpt that Musk has hit a new low: "Sandra Sucher, a professor of management at Harvard University who has studied layoffs for more than a decade, said Twitter‚Äôs cuts were among the most poorly handled that she had seen. While the scale was not unprecedented, it was unusual to see layoffs done so quickly without a detailed explanation provided to workers about who was being laid off and why, she said. ‚ÄúThis is a master class in how not to do it,‚Äù Ms. Sucher said."I'd say he has entered the Layoff Hall of Shame.#twitter #poormanagement #layoffs

Such an important briefing to share while we see so many #recruiters being impacted by #layoffs as companies become challenged to scale.  During a downturn, #talentacquisition can perform a whole host of value-added activities in preparation for the turnaround - letting #recruiters go will only cost companies more money when the surge hits and they have to find new #recruiters that will require ramp up time. That will impact their ability to generate candidate pipelines, will significantly impact time to fill, and will ultimately negatively impact the company's revenue growth.

I remember quitting a job after 3.5 years. I thought a 1 month notice was going to be enough to help the company transition. The evening I told my CEO I was resigning, I was told to immediately leave and come back later to get my stuff. I was shocked and saddened. Another job I had, within a year they were going to layoff a big chunk of my department (including me). I had a chance to talk to a cofounder and explained what I do and was given his support to find a new role in the company. Within a couple weeks I found a new role AND I was also reoffered my original position with a promotion and raise. I took the latter. Things don‚Äôt always go as planned at work. I know a lot of you are facing #layoffs right now. I hope you can turn this challenge into an opportunity AND something better. Don‚Äôt give up on yourself. #yougotthis #beopen #onwardsandupwards

Do you know the worst thing to say to someone who lost their job? It's nothing. Here are 6 words (plus a text) you can send to someone with a career plot twist.I heardI'm sorryI'm hereI've talked to many people who've made career transitions as I did almost five years ago.¬†We agreed that we'll never forget the people who connected - and a few that didn't. üòâIn the best of circumstances, big career changes are lonely.With layoffs in the news it seemed timely to share this example.A client asked me how to respond when a colleague lost their job. ‚ùå They wanted to avoid internal politics‚úÖ They respected their colleague and enjoyed working with themI drafted a sample text so he could stop stalling and reach out.It's not that complicated, friends.¬†There‚Äôs no downside to being kind to a client, colleague, or even a friendly competitor.It's like funerals. You just go.You being there isn't reminding someone that they lost a loved one. It shows they made a difference and matter to you.Who shoud you reach out to?

Getting laid off from any company is hard. It‚Äôs a situation where you overthink and over analyze every little detail which lead up to that moment.

Employees and employers are connected to each other not only financially but also emotionally.

This is a good reminder for us all to slow down.I often need the reminder, to just slow down and take a breath.Maybe do NOT send that e-mail, or do NOT send that text.Maybe wait a bit longer and sit on it for a day.What are the potential consequences, in our fast paced digital world, for impulsively clicking send.For me, my tendency to move fast has resulted in some "collateral damage." In my professional life, I've rubbed some people the wrong way, by speaking when I might be better off saying nothing.So, maybe, instead of coming in, like a bull in a china shop, we can all learn a lesson from this very wealthy person, acting like an impulsive child.I often move too fast, and sometimes that strains relationships.#business #culture #silliconvalley #workplaceculture #elonmusktwitter #elonmusk #lawsuits

So I‚Äôve walked the puppies about 30 extra times the last few days and they‚Äôre tired. My role was rif‚Äôd at Lyft on Thursday morning along with about ~700 other #layoffs and the timing wasn‚Äôt great but - since then, I‚Äôve seen 2 movies, watched a half season of West Wing, had the privilege of seeing Wynonna Judd‚Äôs final tour, bought some jazz records at Grimey's New & Preloved Music, put together an ikea nightstand, had dinner at my in-laws and kept moving forward. The culture at  Lyft was unlike anywhere I‚Äôve experienced and the #people were what drove that. Being authentic at work is more important than a salary or stock options. I‚Äôll start my search soon for my next thing -  please feel free to let me know if you have any ideas. In the meantime? I  have family time and things to build. (And puppies to walk)

I read a post about companies not being mindful of the employees and their families when they do layoffs and that they dont reskill and redeploy you. What we have to realize is companies are operating with "other peoples money". Investors who raise money from other investors who tap into pension funds (people in the last leg of their lives risking losing money and never making it again). In a down economy there is no benefit in investing in the future (which is what reskilling does) as you are struggling to stay afloat. So people have to rightskill not reskill. Its possible that layoffs are not just about numbers but rightskilling thrown into the mix. Companies like Zoho or Zerodha are not under that pressure because they dont run their business with other people's money. Everyone else does. BYJU'S for example is a loss making gig that does all its work with OPM. I am not defending or villifying anyone but you owe it to yourself to know the difference between operating with Other peoples money and expecting to care for your situation and those that actually have their own invested or generated money and can make the operational decsions they do. #economy #business #layoffs

It was a heartbreaking week at Stripe as so many incredible people were lost as part of the unfortunate layoff. These were truly some of the best teammates I've ever had the privilege of working with. During this time of transition, I'm wondering if any of my Product Design + UXR friends out there know of any openings that I could forward along? Looking for #remoteroles, senior-level, UXR.

Hoping you all that have been affected by recent layoffs are having a good weekend. I know it can be easily sabatoged by the stress of the unknown. I‚Äôve felt it for 13 months now. Sure, I‚Äôve had some part time work here and there which eases the stress, but it‚Äôs not the same when you have full time work that pays well. Please know you are all in my thoughts. Have a listen to my podcast and reach out to me afterwards so I can help further.

This week has been a pretty interesting one, given all the layoffs and exiting that has been happening.I truly know the pain of going through this transition, it is not easy and it will feel lonely.

I remember that day in June when hundreds of us got laid off on a Teams call. Within an hour our access was cut off.It was inhumane. It was painful.For hundreds of us who gave a lot, on nights and weekends. It was personal. We were ùêáùêîùêåùêÄùêçùêí ‚Ä¶ Humans who had medical conditions. Humans who had disabilities.Humans who were the only breadwinners for our families. Humans on visas who had to return to a ‚Äúhome‚Äù country they no longer called home.... and the company did not see us that way, they saw us as numbers on a spreadsheet. üíî Layoffs are made for business decisions. And I get it.BUT ‚Ä¶It's not hard to treat someone like a human and with dignity. #kindnessmatters  Many people have been impacted in recent weeks and are surfing the range of emotions. Many people just like me were laid off in a way that no human should be treated.And while we can all say to the employers ‚Äúdo not do it‚Äù, I want to offer concrete help to those that were affected, because I have been where you are now. It hurts. It is hard.Finding yourself without a job is a very scary time for many.So, here‚Äôs how I can help:‚û°  If you see someone in my network who is hiring, I am happy to introduce you to them.‚û°  If you need a resume or #Linkedin profile review, DM me‚û° If you need a pep talk, DM me.And I encourage people in my network to do the same.After all, we are all HUMAN. ‚ù§ And we can help each other.#layoffs #leadership #empathy¬†#hiring

To increase employability nowadays, it is necessary to increase professional visibility. Even if you have no interest in finding a new job, keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date is a good insurance policy.¬†Creating a strong profile & building networks take quite a bit of time, so it‚Äôs better to have those done in the event that you do need to look for a new role.My story: Headhunter ran across my LinkedIn profile & emailed me about an opportunity. I had zero experience in the position they were sourcing for. Figured it wouldn't hurt to talk to headhunter instead of replying back with, "No thanks".We talked & headhunter proceeded to discuss another role not published, the one I'm in now :-)#advice #linkedin #serendipity #networking #opportunities #hiddenjobs #opentowork #layoffs

RIFs suck no matter the reason and whether you're the one making the decision or you're the one being laid off.  Planning proper communications is a key to limiting the pain.  Plan communications for the management team (to understand the decisions made, the reasons behind them, and how to communicate with their teams), the employees being let go, the employees remaining, and, if a larger and/or public company, the public.  Twitter is learning this lesson the hard way.  Stripe seems to be taking the right approach. (Also, remember to do your disparate impact study, provide appropriate federal and state WARN notices, and comply with final paycheck rules per location.)  #TheRetailLawyer #employers #RIFs #WARN #layoffs #employees #attorneyadvertisement #WBE #wbencnetworkhttps://lnkd.in/ekz7ytx7

Tech Giants always raise bar high. They set milestones which the whole industry follows. Previously they raised the bar high for hiring, work culture, quality of deliverables, compensation structure etc. Other organisations copied them. (with some customisation). Now they are setting the bar high in working hours, cost cutting, layoff etc. This may set an example for other organisations to follow the same. https://lnkd.in/ggRr3cFs#twitter #google #layoffs #softwaredeveloper #meta #hiringnow #hrrecruiter #growth #interview #workculture #dsa #maang #twitterlayoffs

It‚Äôs disheartening to see so many posts from those impacted by recent layoffs, and many of who were on leave too.Whatever it is you‚Äôre struggling through, know that there are many people, like me, willing to support you however we possibly can. So I‚Äôll share something. If I haven‚Äôt told you before, you wouldn‚Äôt know. I do disclose and advocate for. Not all do. I‚Äôve found myself fighting hard to recover from a serious medical condition- multiple times. I‚Äôve learned to see it as building strength, not a weakness. Like many, I‚Äôve fought hard, and for a successful career.Watching John Fetterman running for U.S. Senate, speaking openly about his own ongoing recovery, resonates. I say this politics aside. It‚Äôs an important subject. Perhaps this is my opinion, however, I‚Äôll defer to human history as my teacher here: To compete globally over time, a healthy workforce with strong social contracts are needed. Neither should be taken for granted. We‚Äôre all human beings. #people #abilitynotdisability #layoffs #beaforceforgood #diversity

It‚Äôs all a bit much: job searching in this environment.What is one to do with no college degree or trades certifications? Especially when employers don‚Äôt want to train you.One can‚Äôt help but feel like after 800 applications in a small slot of time, that a job market that was once responsive is now shut out and cruel to an average employment seeker.I fear those with the absolute concrete corporate backed institutional background will be competing with those ‚Äúless qualified‚Äù on paper.The question begs: How can I pay my ever increasing rent, keep up my groceries, pay my inflated utilities bills, and all else, while ignoring all my basic medical, dental, and other needs while trying to better myself for prospective employers through school (which costs money), and certifications(also money) on zero dollar an hour or year budget.I personally feel and have seen a disconnect between employers and prospective employees with budgetary concerns on a personal and private level that we have to hide because it seems sloppy or unprofessional. I have felt myself sinking into a category of undesirable potential candidate since the pandemic with project after project with the promise of stable work only to be let go or put in extreme and unhealthy and often unethical work environments(and often illegal).Despite several corporate or professional consultation on my resume, nothing seems to change, and what was once a lively and engaging market is hostile and aggressive. I personally have tried: gigs, LinkedIn, Craigslist, Facebook, calling and emailing recruiters, websites for an individual company and their job listing, personal networking, indeed, going in person and delivering resumes, making phone calls. In the past six months I have delivered approximately 1,000+ applications to the point of obsession. It has become my job, and the times I have received a call back that was not a scam has tallied to maybe 10 times. While I did receive one offer which I accepted the onboarding account manager has been ghosting my questions when the paperwork was sent over and I will likely not make the deadline due to their negligence.I am sure this post will not receive any comments or likes. But I am tired of : ‚Äúsee the positive in being laid off as an opportunity for better‚Äù narrative being spoken.Be disgruntled, hold people accountable, stop pushing the narrative and know that though it‚Äôs coming from a place of privilege.  Its okay to be terrified.Jobs and money are your livelihood and this is not a joke. Your job is not your hobby. Some people have the option to live with mom after a layoff, many dont.‚ÄúUnqualified ‚Äú candidates like myself are often one paycheck away from homelessness.To that end, I will take your suggestions. I will take your open roles and keep applying. I am even open to relocation and career change. I am utterly beside myself.Thank you for reading my rant.#unapologetic #unemployed #layoffs #lookingforjob

Even if you think you don‚Äôt need help with your resume, I highly suggest taking advantage of this. To all of my #laidoff #Lessen friends and those affected by the myriad #layoffs by #opendoor, #better, #stripe, and many other companies whose bad news has been plaguing my feed: you should definitely hop on board. Cole helped me redesign my resume when I was switching to management from a sales background. As soon as I updated my resume with his tips and suggestions, I stopped getting targeted by sales recruiters and had multiple prospective employers reach out to me to schedule interviews for PM positions. Thanks to him, I landed a job with Lessen and was able to have a career I honestly loved for the past 10 months leading up to the layoffs. I met a bunch of people and made relationships that have helped me continue to work in residential project management even after I lost my position.

With all the #layoffs happening, I would like to remind you to be mindful of things you say to someone who has lost their job, whether they were laid off/fired or quit.People do not always "find another job."If they do, the next job may not be better. At all. One door closing does not necessarily mean another opens.People who desperately need every paycheck do not want to hear how they are "better off without" their workplace, no matter how bad it was.They don't need platitudes, false encouragement or unsubstantiated sunshine about how great this is going to turn out for them. Sometimes, it absolutely DOESN'T turn out great. You don't know that someone is going to "land on their feet" or "find something better." People absolutely can become homeless because they lost their job. Here's are things you SHOULD or COULD do:Say you're sorry. Ask how you can help. Buy them a coffee so they can talk. Review their resume for errors. Send their resume to everyone in your network. Send them job leads. Send a grocery gift card. Give them cash. Tell them about aid networks like food pantries. Hugs. Offer to take care of their kids while they interview or go to a pantry. Connect them w/local job search resources (don't forget the library).#helper #jobsearchstrategies #employment #networking

Brutal time for the Twitter India team. approx 78% of employees were laid off.This is the difference between entrepreneur & employee. People nowadays when become manager or get promoted they tend to think they are the owner of company which they don't. So when a entrepreneur fires you don't cry because you are a white color labour & nothing else......#twitterupdate #twitternews #layoffs # #entrepreneur #entrepreneurlife #entrepreneurmindset #entrepreneurship #growthmindset #sympathy #indiajobs

Read somewhere in the news that "most" #employees from Twitter India were fired in an early 4a.m. #email by #Twitter.We've gotten accustomed to this daily insensitivity depiction of Indian media or any other national #media for that matter.Still, losing a source of #livelihood on one fine morning, that should not happen with anyone!! And also it is dire important to check the veracity of what most media channels #publish, even here on #LinkedIn!!#jobs #jobsearch #jobseekers #jobloss #layoffs #abhibatao

I‚Äôm pissed off about these layoff announcements. I have witnessed some of the most irresponsible decision-making. Extravagant spending. Absurd expense accounts. Multiple millions of dollars thrown out the window for failed projects. And when it comes to the people, humans with bills, mortgages, children, aging parents who give up their time to help companies make profit ‚Äî they‚Äôre dispensable.Trim the fat. Tell them over email. But make sure those in our inner circles are taken care of.

Tough times don‚Äôt last, tough people do.My heart goes out to people impacted by layoffs.The most notable layoffs this week were Twitter (3600+ people laid off) and Stripe (1000+ people laid off).Losing a job is one of the most stressful life events. It‚Äôs hard, emotional, and traumatizing.On the other hand, it can also be a relieve and blessing in disguise. You may not realize that until later on. I lost my job in 2011 - two months before my wedding. I was emotional yet glad it gave me the space to plan my wedding. Losing my job was the best thing that happened as it gave me the fire to kick start my coaching business within a week.Some quick advice on dealing with a layoff / job loss:  üíé Seek legal advice of what you‚Äôre entitled to - fight for your rights!üíé Take some time off to process your emotions, sleep in and unwind üíé Reflect on what you really want next and what your non- negotiables areüíé Map out your proud career highlights üíé Remind yourself of your amazing qualities and strengths üíé Cut out unnecessary expenses üíé Talk to friends and colleagues üíé Take advantage of free career transition & job search resources available, hire career experts if you can  üíé Update your LinkedIn, resume and elevator pitch üíé Be active on LinkedIn to increase your visibility and ask for help üíé Consider starting a side hustle for extra income - monetize your expertise üíé Upgrade your knowledge and skills with LinkedIn Learning coursesüåü Remember: You are more than your job title. You are worthy and valuable.üìçDON‚ÄôT RUSH into a new job without doing your due diligence and knowing what you truly want and what makes you happy. Be kind to yourself.As a Career Coach for over a decade, I‚Äôve seen too many people this past year start a job and decide to leave within a few months as it‚Äôs not the right fit. (Aka job not as advertised)I‚Äôve also seen people quit a job due to burnout without anything lined up. Haven‚Äôt seen this in 10 years.We‚Äôre living in unprecedented times. Take care of yourself and mental health.I‚Äôll be offering a free training on Nov 17 on ‚ÄúHow to Navigate Your Career Post Layoff‚Äù.

Not the best way to end the year with MORE #layoffs. To everyone looking for a new opportunity (affected by layoffs since 2020, 2021, and 2022. Looking to return to the workforce due to personal matters or transition to a new opportunity.), sending best wishes.My mother always said, "make sure you don't jump out of one fire into another." In this case, let's ensure you don't leave one horrid workplace for another.

TIPS:- TikTok is an excellent search engine lookup "layoffs...", if you want real-time updates from real people. Of course, other social media.- LinkedIn search "layoff and the company name" as you're interviewing. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:- "Is this a new position or back-fill?"- "What's the business need for this role?" - "Has the company had any recent downsizing / was this department affected by the downsizing?" #shadenespeaks #linkedincommunity #hrcommunity #jobsearchtips #jobchangers #jobseekers #jobseekingtips #jobseeking

Dear leaders: Unless you have a crystal ball, you can't promise your employees that there won't be layoffs.You can't even promise them that there won't be MORE layoffs.Although we all are desperate for a sense of security,  it's a false one, and it'll only add to the sense of betrayal if those layoffs come.So don't tell your employees they're safe. Nothing is guaranteed.Tell them you'll do everything you can. Promise you'll be transparent about what's happening. Offer your support and help throughout the process.And if your employees feel they need to jump ship for something more secure, give them your best recommendation and best wishes. This is the way.#layoffs #jobsecurity #career

Yesterday was tough. There is no other word to describe it. It was hard to wake up and hear your CEO announcing lay offs in a massive scale to ensure that the org stays afloat. Especially tough when your direct team is impacted. It's hard for the leadership to take such a decision that they knew will bring tears to their org. It's hard for the employees to take in this news. Many had the intuition, some were caught completely unaware.One thing that helps these situations is relying on our networks to help connect these individuals with new opportunities. We've had smart, driven, motivated individuals who I know will excel in their next opportunity. If anyone knows of Training, L&D, Content design, OD, Process Excellence, Supply Chain LM/FM/Warehousing opportunities; please reach out. I would be happy to share resumes and refer them. #opportunity #training #supplychain #layoffs #hiring

We are seeing so many layoffs this week. It's scary out there and my heart goes out to everyone who has been impacted. My advice as a recruiter: Reach out to as many recruiters as you can. Why?1. We have access to job listings that are not public2. Our job is to find jobs for you, meaning the more recruiters that have your information, the more sets of eyes you have on the job market3. When you apply to a role through a recruiter, your information gets put directly into the hiring manager's hands, rather than lost in a sea of online applicationsIf you have been impacted by a layoff and are in the #marketing, #creative, or #digital spaces, drop me a line. I'd love to be a resource for you. #hiring #layoffs #twincities #recruiter

RIFs suck no matter the reason and whether you're the one making the decision or you're the one being laid off.  Planning proper communications is a key to limiting the pain.  Plan communications for the management team (to understand the decisions made, the reasons behind them, and how to communicate with their teams), the employees being let go, the employees remaining, and, if a larger and/or public company, the public.  Twitter is learning this lesson the hard way.  Stripe seems to be taking the right approach. (Also, remember to do your disparate impact study, provide appropriate federal and state WARN notices, and comply with final paycheck rules per location.)  #TheRetailLawyer #employers #RIFs #WARN #layoffs #employees #attorneyadvertisement #WBE #wbencnetworkhttps://lnkd.in/ejpqfXbz

#layoffs #layoffsandjobreductions Layoffs vs RIFs.I never consider myself a tech guru or a specialist in anything coz no matter how much you know or will know in your entire life, it would remain just a drop in the ocean. Many folks have DM'ed me asking about layoffs at Microsoft or the news circulating around these days.TBH, I really don't bother myself abt such news while I was working at Amazon or now at Microsoft. Also, this doesn't mean that I'm not empathetic about folks who met this outcome (got RIFed) recently. Layoffs are usually triggered by recession, budget cuts, etc. (when companies start bleeding money, low on revenue and can't pay all their employees) while RIFs (Reduction in Force) are usually scrapping of certain roles/positions/teams/orgs which are no longer needed as they are not bringing any value addition, creating impact or generating revenue for the company. Yes, it does have huge impact on the ones who fall under the radar all of a sudden. However, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, etc. almost always sensitize these situations and compensate generously (if not heavily) to the employees who are let go (give them 3 months of advance salary or even more. HRs would know better than me here).Net-net, it's a business transaction and I always say one would stay with the other only until goals of both are met viz. employees are getting recognition, promotions and exciting projects to learn and the company is making money, generating profit and creating impact for the customers using their products/services. If employee is falling short, you get fired or PIPed or RIFed. If company is falling short, then you resign and leave for a better salary.All I'm saying to those who met this sad reality - it's not the end of the world, infact it's never the end of the world, so take it with a smile or with a pinch of salt and move on please.For those who don't even work at these companies, please don't become gossip aunties/uncles/males/females or the ones *chaar log kya kahenge* coz you just entered that group ü§£Now, one can ask what if I ever get into this situation (RIFed by companies like Amazon, Microsoft), I would really take it with a smile. Thank them for the learnings and experiences I had while working there and for the livelihood they had given me over years (where I earned tons of money üí∞, fulfilled my dreams, created connections, learnt a lot) and now it's my time to move on. Be positive, be hopeful, be happy in life.Now it's Diwali time, so a piece of learning that I had from Lord Rama's journey - never become bitter in your life if something bad happens (it will happen for sure). Stay calm, composed, focused and jolly.*Maryada Purushottam* (purushon mein uttam) only gets born once in centuries because nowadays people can't even take a little pinch, they are ready to gossip, become bitter and give it all back with negativity.

Welp. Looks like the growing #layoffs party is a rager. üçª Salespeople - I'm sorry our senior leadership overcommitted to the board, over hired, and had to make some "really tough decisions." (Poor babies ü•∫) It sucks. It's not fair. They said we were pretty!Ok so right about now, everyone and their cousin wants you to "let them know how they can help." (You should sometimes, btw.) I believe I have a more direct approach.Now that I have some unexpected free time on my hands the sales leader in me still wants to serve salespeople like I always have since they deserve better. Here we go: I've conducted over 500 sales interviews in my career. I have used that experience to help dozens of my close friends and colleagues prep for and land their next gig by conducting mock interviews with them. I'm extending that to you fellow job seekers* for free. Absolutely free. No strings attached. I'll never ask you for anything in return. ‚≠ê I'm reserving 5-10 time slots per week through EOY where I will mock interview you for 30 minutes, with 15 minutes of feedback. First come, first served. ‚≠ê How was your posture? Did you ask great questions? How was your storytelling? Did you understand the question behind the question? If this could be of value to you, drop a comment or message me directly and we'll get it scheduled.If you know someone this could help, make sure they see this. *Sorry friends who are currently employed, you'll have to wait your turn. #sales #interviewing #hollaatchaboi

Like many others, my time at Twitter has also come to an end. I am eternally grateful I got the opportunity to work with such a talented, dedicated, and wonderful group of people in my tenure. To my teams in Developer Platform, thank you for everything. I have learned so much from all of you, and am extremely grateful for your partnerships. We have accomplished so much together in my 2 year time period, and I am extremely proud of all the work we have done. Even when the odds were against us this year, it was amazing to see everyone step up and shine. I will dearly miss working with you all, and I hope we get to work together sometime in the future. To any recruiters, companies, or managers that are hiring, know that these Tweeps are some of the most experienced and passionate individuals I have ever worked with.

My feed is filled with people impacted by the massive layoff at Twitter today, and they're aren't the only ones impacted this week, there have been others. I'm saddened to hear about the decisions to shutdown groups like Blackbirds and teams like Accessibility engineering. And more importantly I'm frustrated at how terribly they're all being treated. I know there's no good way to let people know, but I know it can and should be better than what I'm hearing about. If you are looking for a new job for any reason, please send me a note about how I can help you.

Regarding Twitter's layoffs, Elon's lack of compassion and appreciation for people that built the company, is truly second to none. Groups of talented people coming together are at the heart of every generational business. We're going to see a lot of attrition of top talent, not only for the folks left at Twitter, but also for other companies under his sphere of influence, in the months to come. When your best people start leaving in troves, that is when your innovation engine stops. Money can only go so far --  the "how" you do things matters just as much as the "what" you achieve. #twitter #layoffs #compassion #attrition #peopleareeverything
-----------------------------
Reading about these layoffs has my heart broken üíî  Being impacted by one earlier this year, I can sympathize. For a lot of people in tech, a part of their passion and identity is the work they do for their company [and yes, many of us are guilty of working more than 40hr a week!]. For those who have trouble removing themselves, their identity from work these reminders are for you:-You are not your job- your job is an aspect of who you are but your worth is much much more -It's okay to not feel okay- as silly as it may sound we sometimes live in a world of toxic positivity. While you may not feel amazing today or even tomorrow- I can promise you will not feel this way forever-You deserve to take care of yourself! Self care comes in many shapes and forms; Mental, Emotional, Spiritual, Social, Physical, Practical, etc. Focus on what YOU need at this point in time. Some people will be quick to jump into the practical side and find their next role while others may take a bit more time to do some soul finding and take a break. Whichever type you choose, there is no wrong answer.-It's okay to ask for help- the easier said then done phrase that personally keeps me awake at night. If you are reaching out to family, friends, mentors, LI connections, or just the LI community- we are here for you!  If you see any roles at DoorDash that could be interesting to you or just interesting in networking, please message me. I would love to help in finding your next adventure#layoffs #layoff #stripe #lyft #opendoor #netflix #zillow #compass #wearehiring #doordash #community

I woke up this morning to some unfortunate news - as I have been impacted by the layoffs at Stripe. I have a wide range of emotions right now. As sad as I am, I am also thankful. Stripe gave me an opportunity to work with some of the most curious, intelligent, and wonderful human beings. I was able to recruit across various organizations, work with and hire amazing people, and for the last few months I was given an opportunity to flex and grow as I stretched in a project management role.¬†If you know of any recruiting, people project management, or sourcing opportunities please keep me in mind. #layoffs #opentowork #recruiting #stripe #opportunities

LAYOFFS FREAKING SUCK.....I really need my LinkedIn network to come through for me on this.I just had a conversation with an AMAZING, very professional, Executive Assistant/Office Operations leader who was caught up in a downsizing.We had a short, 30 minute conversation and she told me first hand the HORRORS of some of the interviews she has been on. Some companies (not all!) are taking advantage of job seekers and frustrating doesn't even begin to describe how I felt listening to this. She is located in Nashville, open to on-site or remote opportunities. She is also open to contract roles to get through the holidays until the job market gets a bit better in early 2023.If you are hiring for a similar role or know of anyone at all, comment below or message me and I can make an introduction!!!#hiring #EA #OfficeOperations #recruiter #layoffs #holidays #Remote #Nashville

‚ú® Friday Feels ‚ú® To all the people in my network affected by the large lay offs at Twitter, Stripe and Chime please know we are here for you. ü´Ç As shocking as it is that a large company has let go of such a large number of employees remember, We are here.

Getting laid off suddenly is a staggering reminder of how little control we have as human beings. It's scary, emotional, and stressful. But your story isn't over.  Being forced to look for a new job gives you the opportunity to reevaluate your priorities, goals, and passions. It enables you to start fresh and ensure you are spending time wisely with people who enrich your life. The worst moments in our lives often pave the way to something better. When I got laid off in 2018, I began applying and interviewing for new positions. After a few months, I ended up being offered a role at Google in Austin, Texas. Over the past four and a half years, my life has been forever changed for the better by the people I've met, perspective I've gained, and deep friendships I've built. Look for the silver linings‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú® - they are always there if you take the time to look. #layoffs #bigtech #techhiring #recruiting

Launching: Job Search Coaching Circle for Product ManagersHi friends, with all the recent layoffs and so many folks now searching for their next role, I wanted to offer a way to support more people in their job search. I‚Äôm launching a Job Search Coaching Circle for Product Managers, starting November 14.Who this is for: Product Managers looking for the next role, whether you currently have a job or were recently let go. Focused on those with existing PM career experience, early-to-mid career (Product Manager, Senior PM, Principal PM, Group PM). I may consider also opening up a circle for those aspiring to break into product, so please reach out if that‚Äôs you.How this will work: I‚Äôll be guiding a small group of PMs (up to 6) as we meet for 6 consecutive weeks using Google Meet on Mondays at 10am PT / 1pm ET, November 14 - December 19. Topics will depend on the specific needs of the group, but will likely cover: resume and cover letter prep, informational interviewing, behavioral and case interview prep, and negotiation. Each participant will also get an 1:1 coaching session with me on the topic(s) of their choice. What‚Äôs it cost: $350 per person, for 6 group sessions plus a 60min 1:1 session with me.Comment or DM if interested, and please re-post/share with your PM community üôè#layoffs #productmanagement #coaching #jobsearch

So you were sitting there working hard in your office with all the paper and the blinding computer screens and the bad coffee, and the people you've met at work with good intentions, but you opened up your email, or received that phone call, and you lost your job anyway.If you have been impacted by the recent layoffs, I'm sorry.Your value means more than any CEO/CFO sitting in front of a spreadsheet with a blank stare coldly crunching the numbers and deciding who to cut for business purposes.You get to say what this means for you and your family. No company or co-worker gets to define your worth. You do.Remember your value.#Culture #Layoffs #Careers
-----------------------------
Thursday morning I woke up to an email with the subject, ‚ÄúRaneen, Your Role at Stripe,‚Äù and I knew what was coming next. Although impacted by the #layoffs, my Role at Stripe went beyond fighting financial crimes. My Role at Stripe was helping people feel like they were truly part of an extraordinary team and organization. It was building a new community for my fellow MENA colleagues to feel safe, seen, and heard at a place they spend more than half of their days at. It was creating and fostering partnerships that have turned into lifelong friendships. My Role at Stripe was so much more than the work I produced and it was so special. My 3 year journey there is one I will remember forever. I am sure you‚Äôve all seen the same message from my insanely talented fellow colleagues also impacted, but it truly is the brilliant people at Stripe that make this sting a little less. I greatly appreciate the outpour of love and support I‚Äôve been receiving, and I‚Äôm excited for the next chapter in my career as I‚Äôm #opentowork once again.
-----------------------------
Today was a really hard day at Stripe.  Waking up to news of your company experiencing a 14% reduction in workforce, including incredible members on my team and many within the larger GTM System team. They are some of the most driven, smart, curious, compassionate, and resilient individuals I have known.  If you are in my network and hiring, please reach out to me and I'd love to connect you.  #salesforcejobs #hiring #layoffs #tpm #pgm #gtm

As the economic conditions change, it's sad to see even big companies with deep pockets using us employees as the damage control and laying off people. For the company, it's just a number in the income statement and balance sheet. But for the employees, it's their life, their reputation,  their dream. everything that they worked for till now is getting squished. Anyone impacted by #layoffs at Twitter (#twitter) or #stripe or #chime please do contact me. I can do my best to connect you the right people to help your situation. I am also looking for great people at #Discover, so would love to #hire myself  if everything  aligns.

There's no way around it: being laid off is never welcomed‚Äîand it's dismaying to see the layoff and hiring freeze news across the tech space in recent weeks. But as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic's October readout, there are plenty of companies still hiring. TRM Labs is one of them. TRM provides blockchain intelligence to financial institutions, crypto businesses and law enforcement agencies so they can detect and investigate crypto-related financial crimes‚Äîand our team is hiring across several disciplines including sales, engineering, product, marketing, finance and more. Team TRM is mission focused (customers first), smart and intentional and on a major growth trajectory. The remote-first culture is one of positivity where taking ownership of your work and helping your teammates is a given.Check out the open roles and TRM's culture at https://lnkd.in/gVMYb2Y2 - if you see a job you think you're a fit for, please reach out. #hiring #career #layoffs (not here though - just tagging for visibility)
