You‚Äôre so focused on the future that you have a hard time being present now.   I get it.   There‚Äôs so much to plan for. And if you do it right, everything will go just as it should.   No bumps.  No hiccups.   It‚Äôs November and you‚Äôre knee deep into planning for the December holidays. Waist deep even.   Okay, fine, shoulders deep.   You were mostly present for Halloween, and you‚Äôre confident that Thanksgiving will go smoothly -   If everyone follows through with what they‚Äôre supposed to do and there are no surprises.   Maybe you should create a backup plan.  And a backup plan to the backup plan.   And maybe a backup plan to the backup backup plan.   You know, just to be sure.   You‚Äôll prepare for every contingency so you know you can handle anything that comes up.   Except the more you do, the more anxious you get.   You find yourself thinking What If? every time you get still?   What if this? What if that? What if? What if? What if?  So you keep in motion, hoping to stay in front of it.   Because as long as you keep moving, you can keep the other thoughts at bay:  What it says about you if your plan doesn‚Äôt work. What it means if you fail.  All of your insecurities come out to dance.   I know this feeling.  I‚Äôve been there.   And I hear it from lots of folks that I work with - the desire to be so forward thinking that we miss the great things happening in the here and  now.   Journaling can be key to helping both stay present and grounded AND planfully looking forward to the future in a way that feels good.   This month in Better Me, we‚Äôre focusing on Better Gratitude, working on being mindful, present, and  grateful for all the things.   In December we‚Äôll be holding space for both the past and the present as we reflect on where we‚Äôve been this year -  What‚Äôs worked What we‚Äôre proud of What we learned  And set our sights on where we want to go in 2023 - what we want to do/create/be.  What goals we‚Äôll be focused on.   All of this to give ourselves a Better Launch into the New Year.  This is the framework I‚Äôve used for years to honor where I‚Äôve been and set myself up for success.   And this year you can do it with me in a group journaling format.   And how to do it is up to you:  Sign on for Better Launch in December.  Or sign on to a 6 or 12 month membership to Better Me in 2023.   Want more details? Send me a DM and let‚Äôs hop on a call to talk about it.   You deserve it.   #journalingforgrowth #journaling #personaldevelopment #anxiety #goalsetting

Really interesting post Ben Palmer part of me feels like Gary Coulton  like I need to give this some thought before firing off ideas üòÇ... However, the first thing that popped into my head was everyone having a voice and im not just talking about the students here. There needs to be a culture of respect and value all the way through the school. Sadly in many schools, I have been to I think TAs and support staff can feel dismissed when they have amazing ideas, some teachers have fantastic solutions for complex jobs and there will be people on everyone's team that are natural project planners. If we start by recognising and *celebrating* the skills and unique differences we have within our team, this attitude will permeate. Praising passion and innovation from everywhere in the school will model the skills and attitudes we want our students to adopt and ultimately create a culture of inclusion for everyone üòäüí™üíï

WELL-BEING discussions, exercise and investment in organizations need to go beyond the ice-tip! This article explains the 'Why'. Most of us had traumatic childhood experiences, but we depress them, push them out, disconnect from, to adapt, survive, feel loved, keep a relationship and to feel safe. That becomes our coping mechanism as well as our response strategy to triggers in adult life. Consider the amount of depressed emotions supressed to avoid pain over a lifetime, then numming them with addictions, a behaviour to avoid pain that can show up as workaholism, shopaholism, substance abuse, etc.. Where do you think dis-ease comes from?This is a much larger societal conversation that needs to be respected and SERVED as a united multi-institutional collaboration.https://lnkd.in/g7Nx27XP

Tomorrow night, I will board the overnight coach to Canberra to participate in the Perinatal Mental Health Week Launch. Through the Unexpected has joined another 45 organisations in the campaign for the first time. We're here, we get it. This is particularly special for me as someone who struggled with #anxiety, re-experiencing symptoms of #trauma and intrusive thoughts in the perinatal period. As someone who grappled with the unexpected option to continue or end my pregnancy after receiving a prenatal diagnosis at 32 weeks, at a time when I had already packed my hospital bag preparing for birth. I had empathetic health professionals, but they could only give me stats. What did it all mean?I tried to find #support - but it's hard to connect with a therapist when decision-making, because you don't know what they will think or what their stance is. It was hard to talk to others when was was told that I should just tell people I had a stillbirth, if I had a termination. I tried to call the parenting line - but I questioned if I could use that - was I going to be a parent?The first weeks of my parenting journey, I was waiting for further tests wondering if my baby had an underlying syndrome that may shorten her life. Even after that, the fear of what the future may bring her was all-consuming. I didn't sleep, she rarely slept. She struggled to feed. I was obsessed with reading all I could about her diagnosis, because it was rare - I needed to teach her medical team, I couldn't miss anything. But, I felt I was failing her - just like I had when she was growing inside me. If her life was to be hard, it was because of me. When I couldn't cope anymore, I reached out hoping for a short stay in a residential support setting, but we were not eligible - because my daughter had a neurological anomaly, they couldn't allow her there. It was hard to find support - despite being a mental health nurse and knowing the systems.To me, being at the #launch on Monday with so many perinatal support organisations means hope. Hope that we can start to recognise parents who receive a prenatal diagnosis and bridge the divide between fetal medicine/ obstetric care and perinatal mental health. Hope that the 1 in 2 mothers with moderate to severe anxiety following a prenatal diagnosis, the 85% who experience prenatal diagnosis as trauma, the 40% who meet full PTSD criteria, and the parents with suicidal ideation after a diagnosis receive the right support, no matter their pathway through the unexpected. Research over the past 20 years has shown the need - and now we can progress the action. Isolated no more. We're here, we get it.Through the Unexpected: https://lnkd.in/gzvMGUePMHW 2022: www.pmhw.org.au#PMHW #PrenatalDiagnosis #pregnancy #anomaly #perinatalmentalhealth

How to Talk to Kids About Anxiety ---I could have used some of these techniques when helping my son manage his social anxiety when he was young. We didn't realize that he had social anxiety for many years. We knew he had migraines and ADHD. Depression and anxiety came along with the migraines. Living with severe migraines takes a toll.---How to Talk to Kids About Anxiety  By Daniel Flint PhD1. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù ‚Äî facts rarely matter2. Kids may experience anxiety more physically than cognitively, especially at a young age3. Confrontation treats anxiety, and you can‚Äôt always "think your way out of it"3. Confrontation treats anxiety, and you can‚Äôt always "think your way out of it"5. Name it, claim it, and shame it (Using their imagination, have them talk back to the anxiety.

Anxiety - A very real issueI don't like to talk about this topic personally since it doesn't make me feel good but sharing my experience and journey can maybe help someone else, so here we go.I have been through extreme anxiety for a good part of my life. The fact is I still have this issue. Any tension, problem, or argument leads me to these panic attacks and anxiety for a good amount of time, sometimes even months.How do I control and get back to normal?The answer is spending time with friends and family. Watching my favourite movies, shows and youtube content. Listening to music. I have consulted doctors as well have taken proper medication for it.What has helped me?Meditation. The doctors taught me a few ways to reduce anxiety and get me from having these panic attacks. What I recommend is meditation, it would genuinely help if you start feeling anxious. You must consult a doctor.Many such individuals suffer from this issue but never talk about it. The families don't take this issue seriously and friends make fun of them but this is a serious problem. If you are facing it, tell your friends and family, consult a doctor and work towards it, don't hide it.We don't know how our brain functions (at least not completely) so we should stop pretending that we know everything about it and slowly start the journey towards understanding our brain, ourselves and our demons.There isn't anything wrong with anyone suffering from such an issue if we don't make it seem like it.Let's all acknowledge and get rid of it with the proper steps.I hope this experience doesn't take away a couple of years from your life as it did for me. Share your experiences and open up about your anxieties and let's work in a way that this issue never returns.#work #experience #share #help #like #content #doctors #music #anxiety #anxietyawareness #anxietysupport

Someone once told me worry is negative goal-setting. Some worry is good for us, it keeps us and others safe, like holding our childrens‚Äô hands when crossing the road. However, when worry gets out of control and controls us, it can spiral into anxiety which can be detrimental to where we want to be in our lives. Lifeline has some good free resources to explore which can help you find peace with how you see the world in front of you. #anxiety

If chronic anxiety, panic or fear is an issue for you, always address your foundations first.Do you have any space to just ‚Äòbe‚Äô in your life? To stare into space, to do nothing, to be still?To feel balanced you need action and rest. Cycles of activity and inactivity. Elite athletes rest because they know their bodies need time to rest and repair. We're no different.You might be thinking "how is rest going to fix my social anxiety?" or "how is gazing out of a window going to resolve my crippling imposter syndrome?"Granted, on its own it may not.But when you're operating from a baseline of stress hormones and a fried nervous system that's addicted to 'busyness', the way you see the world will become distorted. Your body will be on high alert, you're more likely to interpret a look or a comment defensively and you'll making decisions from a place of needing to protect yourself, rather than letting your brilliance shine.Fill your cup, take a breather and give your mind and body the rest it needs. If you do it enough, you're likely to see challenges and set-backs in a completely different light.Thanks to Aleksandar Cvetanovic  on Unsplash for the image.#rest #burnout #takeabreak #stress #anxiety

Can‚Äôt Sleep? Here is the top  tip That Can Help You Sleep Like a Baby Get to sleep before 11 pm: Circadian rhythm is like a body clock that tells you when to sleep, rise, and eat. Your body starts to produce melatonin (the sleep hormone) at around 9 pm to start to get you ready for bed.Research also shows that the body will only produce certain hormones during the night and only if you are asleep (so if you are awake, your body will miss out on much-needed hormones, which will affect your health).To find out more and book a Your FREE Heart Pulse Diagnosis at our clinic Call 0422 549 542 or Visit https://lnkd.in/gxCM2DDContact Dr Scott Fox (Acupuncture) for an appointment or visit the Sixth Sense Acupuncture stall at the Redcliffe market...#Acupuncture #Chinesemedicine #healthissues #painrelief #health #anxiety #asthma #wellness #sixthsenseacupuncture #yourfreeheartpulsediagnosis

With Daylight Saving Time ending tonight, we will be gaining a coveted hour of sleep.  This can cause changes to our circadian rhythms, which could confuse our sleep-wake cycle. This can result in health issues such as poor sleep, slower reaction times and both physical and mental health issues. In addition to getting plenty of rest, try to get to bed about 30 minutes earlier tonight, eat dinner a bit earlier, avoid caffeine too close to bedtime, and begin your day tomorrow with sunlight.

#stress and #anxiety.  What reaction do these words elicit in you?¬†How would you rate your current level of stress and anxiety?¬†When I was in grade school, I started to have trouble sleeping.¬†My dad was a child psychologist, and instead of giving me melatonin, he gave me relaxation and visualization cassette tapes.¬†This taught me progressive relaxation (body scan) and meditation without even knowing it.¬†I have used these skills throughout my life, especially when I feel stressed and anxious.¬†As a coach, trainer, and facilitator, I have learned much more about anxiety.¬†It can be good as it creates dynamic tension to drive action toward our desired outcomes.¬†However, I am seeing and reading about the damaging effect of prolonged high stress and anxiety levels.¬†You have also felt and heard about a mental health crisis.¬†The challenge is to manage our stress in a way that allows us to use it when we need it and reduce it when we don‚Äôt.¬†Most of us have so much stress that it‚Äôs hard to manage, and it can hold us back from getting what we want.¬†Anxiety can create barriers to our ability to communicate and act in a way that allows us to be the best ‚Äúme‚Äù we can be.¬†I am curious to know what has been effective for you in managing your stress and anxiety.¬†I am trying to understand how we can help employees better navigate high-stress and anxiety levels.¬†¬†#mentalhealth#stressintehworkplace#leadershipcoaching Lynda Foster, CPEQACortex Leadership ConsultingEPIC Leadership Training

Laughs are mandatory at Workplace !¬†The world keeps going through this debate about hard work and smart work. Everybody has their righteous perspectives on this. But personally, I love the smell of #hardwork. I believe that hard work itself makes a person smart.¬†This is that one freaking tired selfie we captured, maybe around a midnight after a super hectic work day.¬†Being a constant #creative is not an easy #job. It consumes 10 times of energy in the brain. So, to not visits the dark side of thoughts and looping in frustration, it is mandatory to #laugh like freaks at workplaces.¬†In #psychology, this stupid idea is called "the laughing therapy".¬†Laugh with no reason. Trust me it makes a relief on super stressful days because laughter can help reduce your #stress, #depression and #anxiety and may make you feel #happier.¬†ANU PERERA

4-7-8 breathing remains one of my favorite and most efficient acute-anxiety-reduction techniques. Use it before performing, before a difficult conversation, or simply to calm your worrying mind. It works by:1. Giving your organs and tissues a much-needed oxygen boost.2. Regulating the fight-flee-faint response we feel when we‚Äôre stressed (especially helpful if you‚Äôre experiencing sleeplessness due to anxiety or worries at bedtime).3. Forcing the mind and body to focus on regulating the breath, rather than replaying your worries.4-7-8 breathing has been described as a ‚Äúnatural tranquilizer for the nervous system.‚Äù#selfcare #selfimprovement #anxiety #anxietyrelief #psychology #mentalhealth #breathwork

#infertility #stress #psychological #patient #dropout #anxiety #cortisol #resiliency #Ginefiv PACIENTES RIF Y SUS EMOCIONES: REFLEXI√ìN PERSONAL Las pacientes inf√©rtiles y sobre todo las que tienen diagn√≥stico de RIF, presentan un cuadro de muy baja autoestima, alta frustraci√≥n y ansiedad, sentimientos de culpabilidad, miedo y rabia, aislamiento social y todo esto repercute de manera directa en su relaci√≥n de pareja. A muchos de nosotr@s nos habr√° pasado de enterarnos de repente de una separaci√≥n en el medio de un ciclo y tener que convertir una IVF a una vitrificaci√≥n ovocitaria o cancelar una transferencia embrionaria. Sin embargo, tambi√©n tengo el recuerdo de muchas parejas luchadoras, compenetradas y unidas por un amor muy profundo que como una ola poderosa logra levantar y vuelve a levantar estados de √°nimos y emociones muy negativas. ¬øEntre pacientes RIF, que hace entonces la diferencia?¬øPor qu√© hay pacientes que afrontan este desaf√≠o mejor que otr@s?En mi opini√≥n depende de muchos factores. El primero es la autoestima y el grado de amor propio. Si te quieres te proteges,  si algo te lastima, terminas acept√°ndolo por no sufrir m√°s y buscas la luz en otras opciones o alternativas. Si no eres tu prioridad seguir√°s tortur√°ndote por lo que no hiciste, lo que no tienes y lo que no alcanzaras. Te cerrar√°s en un c√≠rculo en que no dejaras entrar a nadie. El segundo factor es la resiliencia, propia de cada persona. Para m√≠ es un verdadero don y es afortunado quien lo tiene. Es la fuerza que te hace ver m√°s all√° del pasado y del presente y te anima cada d√≠a a no perder la esperanza de una vida feliz con o sin tus objetivos alcanzados.El tercer factor es el apoyo emocional por parte de nuestro entorno: Mari√°n Rojas, psiquiatra y autora de ‚ÄòEncuentra tu persona vitamina‚Äô, dice que los abrazos son necesarios y, seg√∫n ella, la oxitocina se genera en los abrazos, las caricias, en las miradas compasivas y en el sentirse querid@.¬† La oxitocina potencia el sistema inmune y baja los niveles de cortisol. Seg√∫n la psicoterapeuta Virginia Satir necesitamos 8 abrazos al d√≠a para ser felices. ¬øDeber√≠amos, entonces, prescribir tambi√©n abrazos como terapia adyuvante en RIF?      ¬°Pues s√≠! Nuestr@s pacientes RIF necesitan, adem√°s de un apoyo social, tambi√©n un apoyo psicol√≥gico. Sin embargo me parece igualmente imprescindible el apoyo emocional constante de su m√©dico, que vive con ell@s fracasos y logros y que a trav√©s de la mutua confianza l@s haga sentir parte de un √∫nico equipo. Hace unos d√≠as se han embarazado Cristina y Natalie, dos pacientes RIF encantadoras que siempre han confiado en m√≠, que han sido parte de mi equipo desde el primer d√≠a y durante mucho tiempo. Afortunadamente, los logros compensan siempre esfuerzo y sufrimiento.

I love my work. Today, while coaching a client's coworking operations team, I shared a mindfulness micro practice to help one team member navigate moments where anxiety and overwhelm keep them from being their best self. As we took a Pause. Breathe. Reflect. moment together, and I taught them how to use box breathing to calm their nervous system, I could feel their relief through the Zoom screen. A we signed off, they had tears in their eyes while offering appreciation for our session. One small human moment of sharing this mindfulness practice made a significant impact on their tough week.Delivering this level of support to people in the workplace feels good in the face of so much need in the world today.Interested in learning more about building a mental health positive culture in your workplace?

Whilst many of us love this time of year and watch with glee as the night sky is filled with reds, golds, and greens, for some of us those sights, smells, and sounds can transport us back to a time of fear and horror. For veterans,  fireworks can increase feelings of anxiety, irritation, anger, and even result in flashbacks. If you are a veteran, or you want to support a veteran, here are six tips that you might find helpful...1. Seek support from trusted friends, family, or loved ones.2. Use orientating phrases to help you stay connected with the present. 3. Use scents or smells which have no association with your military experiences.4. Practice abdominal breathing. 5. Get moving! Burn off the adrenaline with some squats, lunges, or yoga.6. Access mental health support from trained professionals or organisations.

#Fear is built into our biology. In fact, it keeps us safe ‚Äî alerting us to #danger and saying, ‚ÄúHey, you need to be careful‚Äù.  But there‚Äôs a big difference between our brain alerting us of potential dangers, and an extreme #anxiety or fear that danger is always looming. This extreme fear is actually a phobia called #agoraphobia, marked by two or more of the following: üöé Using public transportationüèô Being in open spacesüöÉ Being in enclosed spacesüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Standing in line or being in a crowdüè† Being outside of the home alone Individuals with agoraphobia severely fear and avoid situations of the like out of worry that they won‚Äôt be able to escape or get help if they start to panic.

When I first posted about Islamophobia Awareness Month two years ago, not many people were talking about it. This year, it's encouraging to see a significant change in awareness. However, what has yet to change is how many people still argue as to why this is even needed. The theme this year #tacklingdenial is, therefore, very fitting. Unfortunately, despite stark evidence to substantiate the need to address Islamophobia, many organisations & institutions still do not acknowledge its existence nor recognise the lived experiences of those who experience it.My 'Muslimness' is integral to my identity, but I will be honest. When I first moved to the UK, I was cautious about publicly displaying my affiliation with my #religion for fear of #judgement, #labelling and #stereotyping. However, I soon realised that I would only be reinforcing the harmful tropes if I didn't own my faith or show up for it. So I chose to stop hiding and started proudly and publicly embracing it while creating awareness through writing and speaking.But while I am grateful to get the opportunity to advocate for something important to me, I have to admit that it came with a price. Writing for national publications made me fully aware for the first time of what it's like to be simultaneously targeted for one's gender, race, skin colour, country of origin and, most explicitly, faith. Nearly every time I chose to speak about my faith, it brought in a barrage of hateful comments & blatant dismissals that sparked debilitating #anxiety. Many would relate to how being exposed to vindictive and spiteful remarks time and again is not an easy pill to swallow. We are advised to ignore comments & develop a thick skin, which we eventually do. Still, there is no denying that being at the receiving end of frequent vitriol and feeling the need to defend ourselves constantly has a toll on our #psychologicalsafety and sense of #belongingatwork. We often have to opt-out of conversations to preserve our #mentalhealth & consciously take breaks to #heal ourselves.Anyhow, the point of this rant is that #faithdiscrimination is real and delaying recognising the definition of what #Islamophobia constitutes will only give a free pass for even more 'bigotry and division.'If, as an organisation, you are hesitant to talk about faith discrimination, then it's time you make it part of the broader #DEI conversation. Many Muslim professionals struggle to belong, often hiding facets of their identity related to appearance, affiliation, association, and advocacy. Recognise and address their unique challenges to help maintain their sense of inclusion. Although religion may seem an #uncomfortable topic to broach, it would be helpful to remember that religion is a significant part of the lives of millions of people globally. Including faith affiliation in your DEI efforts will give these people a renewed sense of #identity that has long been denied or misunderstood.#IAM2022 #faithandwork #muslimmentalhealth

The most ideal environment for a child to grow healthy is within a caring family environment where their parents care for each other and care for them, and to know this will never change.A person becomes prone to depression and anxiety when either one of these conditions are missing in their life. In most cases they will over-react when they perceive things aren‚Äôt going well with the relationship, and will leave rather than go through the pain of being abandoned.  The good news is there is hope when such trauma has taken place. Through counselling and therapy benefits can be healing and life transforming.Book a call now!Holistic, practical, relevant wellbeing program which addresses Life Ready course requirements, and provides relational skills for lasting healthy relationships.üåê https://lnkd.in/ggbndt6yüìß approach@grassrootlevel.com.au üì± 1300 931 539  #healthyrelationships #grassrootsapproach #family #anxiety #depression

It is a little scary to admit that we suffer from anxiety. But does it make it more palatable if it high functioning? When we continue to get praised and rewarded  for what sits at the top of the iceberg, we believe the cost that ‚Äòappears‚Äô to fuel it must be worth it.I am able to relate to every single thing that sits under this iceberg but until recently, I wouldn‚Äôt have described myself as anxious. I haven‚Äôt wanted to call it anxiety. That would mean I might be mentally ill. Maybe it is time to rethink this and start talking about the world of work we‚Äôve built that has been feeding on what sits under the iceberg.Maybe in that rethinking, we can find a better way where our work doesn‚Äôt cost us our wellbeing. It starts with you and me. It starts with a conversation.  #wellbeing #work #anxiety

So to give myself time to sit with it.¬†If anyone is out there who can tag people, charities and organisations around Adult ADHD, that will help me and others who may be reading this.Time to embark on a new journey of discovery üôÇ¬†¬†To conclude:Thanks so much if you are reading this, and for your support.¬†Beyond our smile üòÅ, there's a battle many of us are fighting.¬†¬†So.....on the last day of #adhdawarenessmonth I'm sharing this.¬†In the hope, it informs, educates and encourages others to open up, talk and explore their journeys to find the answers they're looking for.If you want to talk about this post or anything else I write, never hesitate to reach out.¬†¬†As for today......¬†¬†......I'm off to celebrate my birthday by experiencing a Flotation Tank #flotationtanktherapy for the first time ¬†¬†¬†¬†Have a great Monday, everybody üíôüíöüß°üíúüíõü§ç#adhd #adultadhd #adhd #neurodiverse #neurodivergent

And amazing!Your brain is capable of offering up 60,000 thoughts a day about everything from what will likely kill you to what you'll do when you when you win the lottery but it can't tell what is the truth or a lie unless you tell it what to believe.Your brain gets its direction from your senses but also from your body and interprets what everything means, but in the scariest possible way to keep you safely tucked away on the couch eating cookies and watching Netflix instead of doing amazing things that would allow you to go hog wild in life! Remember that vacation you were dreaming of? Forget it, it's probably impossible/deadly/dangerous. Stay home. Stay safe. Stay alive.

You can be right or left dominant for each. The same is true of your ears üëÇüëÇ. One is dominant, which means it's processing the information faster than the other. That might be because the connections of the brain's right and left auditory pathways¬†are different.Neurologically, the left ear is connected to the right brain area, while the right ear is connected to the left brain area. The right and left parts of the brain don't use auditory information in the same way.¬†Studies have shown that each part of the auditory cortex is responsible for specific functions. The left auditory cortex (right ear) is linked to language comprehension and logical reasoning, which is essential for academic success. The right auditory cortex (left ear) is dedicated to emotional perception and musicality. According to Dr Tomatis, children are left ear dominant at birth and should naturally switch to right ear dominance at 6-7 years of age. This doesn't always happen, which may cause life-long problems with learning and emotional regulation. Chronic stress and anxiety also affect auditory laterality. If you are left ear dominant or right ear dominant makes a huge difference in everyday life!There are many reasons to contact a Tomatis¬Æ Practitioner and discover how the Tomatis¬Æ Method can help you or your child.#tomatis #tomatismethod #apd #auditorytraining #auditoryprocessing #naturalintervention¬†#musicality #learning #attention #language #logicalreasoning #emotionalregulation #adhd #autism #motorskills #dyslexia #anxiety #homeschooling

What are you holding back from doing so your Best Creation can get created and into the world?This is what my coaching and programs are about: helping you over come the blocks that hold you back, the fear that stops you in your tracks.

Stepping outside my comfort zone - part 1 I was called to be an anchor / facilitator for talk on women‚Äôs cancer in an offline event. I wasn‚Äôt very sure to do that as I have been speaker but never a facilitator for the flow of complete event . So naturally I was uncomfortable . I like to be well prepared like everything written and printer and done to know the flow of the events and as this being one of a kind conference , despite efforts by the organising team , this couldn‚Äôt be possible. Somewhat also intimidated by the extremely high achivecets present in the room while being unprepared with their names and introductions just made my anxiety worse . So we always talk about pushing boundaries and self growth , I am unsure what helps this would have for my future but naturally we should start talking about the uncomfortable feeling of anxiety which creeps in while doing the said activities . What‚Äôs your take on being in unfamiliar uncomfortable situations ? Do you see it as a growth opportunity or contemplating your saying yes to the same in the past .  #opportunity #growth #like #future #team #events #conference #oncology #CME #anchor #facilitator #stress #anxiety #socialanxiety #anxietyawareness

Navigating big transitions, such as starting highschool or a new school year, brings added challenges for young people who are neurodiverse, have ADHD, or experience learning disabilities, anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions. In collaboration with @The Dalai Lama Center, Dr. Jenn Fane, LDS Director of Education, wrote the article "Supporting School Transitions for Tweens and Teens, the Heart-Mind Way", presenting the five Heart-Mind qualities that helps young people adapt to the new challenges and opportunities big transitions bring in a supportive way.Learn more here: https://loom.ly/iKvAjok#HighSchool #LearningDifferences #ADHD #NeuroDiversity #Anxiety #MentalHealth #LearningDisabilities #Depression

A controversial topic with strong opinions on both sides. Using #ketamine therapy for #depression #anxiety and #PTSD and prescribing over #telehealth. I know of friends who have experienced the IV therapy with their psychiatrists and had great outcomes but this interesting article is talking about getting a dose at home and doing it there.  My general take on the topic. Interested in others' opinions and experiences with this üßê:‚ùáÔ∏è The treatment has some positive results in research - but most are observational studies and should be the starting point of understanding how ketamine works in #mentalhealth. We need more info. It's not well studied in doing at home. ‚ùáÔ∏è Right now, scheduled meds can be prescribed virtually without an in person visit with the emergency waivers. They might expire early next year so companies either need to partner with an in person clinic or change their model entirely (in the article, Peak was one that stopped offering it). ‚ùáÔ∏è Ketamine is still used recreationally and there is the potential of distributing to those who are not taking it for a diagnosed condition. I don't see how you get around this. We also don't have enough data to know what might happen in the long term.‚ùáÔ∏è The claim that the drug has FDA approval is disingenuous - it does for anesthesia and sedation, *not* for mental health diseases. We use in the #emergencydepartment all the time for procedures, but not for psychiatry. ‚ùáÔ∏è The lozenge form of ketamine being sent over virtual care has little data ‚Äúno one‚Äôs really studying this in a systematic way from a health care delivery perspective. Research into the safety and efficacy of at-home delivery of ketamine...is extremely limited.'‚ùáÔ∏è Screening is limited and certainly different than the ones being done in clinic. There is less followup and integration of the experience also which may not give the patient the full benefit. Overall, there is potential for its use but there is not enough data known for doing it at home and by themselves and seemingly little follow-up. I am not against scheduled meds being prescribed over #virtualcare per se. However, when you offer it over a #DTC model like this, patients have to sort through the information themselves and see if it's safe - some of what is on the websites does not give them enough of that info. #healthcare #research #experience #fda #data #like #telemedicinesuccess #telemedicine #digitalhealth #phe #scheduledmed #dea

In the News | Alberta To Become First Province in Canada To Regulate Psychedelics For TherapyAccording to the article by CBC News (linked below), new regulations in Canada are to be introduced "to protect the public, and ensure¬†that patients receive high standards of care, plus prevent 'risky drugs' from inadvertently ending up on the streets."  The article continues by clarifying that "Alberta's new regulations would require medical directors to apply for a license before treating patients with psychedelics for mental health disorders." As specified by the regulations (which are to take¬†effect in January 2023), a psychiatrist would also need to be present in order to oversee any psychedelic-assisted treatment being administered.In the opinion of Dr. Peter Silverstone, an Edmonton psychiatrist, "[These] regulations are a pragmatic way to prevent harm¬†while the field [continues to] evolve."Such regulations may seem like further red tape getting in the way of patients receiving life-saving care, but "the goal of the program is to expand access [to psychedelic treatment] across the province, not limit it."You Can Read The Full Article Here: https://lnkd.in/g5T9CszY And, for further information on how you too can tap into the healing power of mushrooms, please visit https://wake.net#psilocybin #psychedelics #therapy #depression #anxiety #wellbeing #MentalHealth

Anxiety is easily seen. It's easily noticed by others and ourselves. It's the attention grabber, the starring role, and physiologically problematic. But the 'anxious' usually exists because it's being constantly fuelled by other parts of ourself. Which ones resonate with you? #therapy #anxiety #anxietyfuel

JUMP.With all the stimulus, noise, chaos and expectations of modern life it‚Äôs easy to get stuck in to a comfortable routine. To begin spinning around ideas in your head only for the devil on the shoulder to start negating them. For the situation of paralysis by analysis to occur only for you to play the safe card, take the path of least resistance and to perpetuate in a cycle of unfulfilling stagnation. Often times it takes a significant life event such as an accident, a divorce or other to shock the psyche in to realising how long you have been in that state. It‚Äôs at that point you can either shy back in to that wheel of life or JUMP. To take jump it takes courage. To jump is the short term bigger risk but one with the long term reward being insurmountably higher. Sometimes the only smart option is to jump..‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be the richest person in the graveyard ‚Äú - Tony Robbins.#jump #risk #takingsouls#mentalclarity #stressrelief #wellbeing #wellness #health #mentalhealth #selfcare #fitness #mindfulness #healthylifestyle #meditation #motivation #mentalhealthawareness #healthyliving #anxiety #lifestyle #healthy #happiness #mentalhealthmatters #mindset #life #therapy #relax #positivity

üåüStart here - cultivating a strong, loving and compassionate relationship with yourself. üíöThis will set the foundations for how you navigate through life. It will set the stage for your relationships with others.üôåIt took me a very long time to discover this. I wish they taught it in schools!  It's like gold dust. A hidden treasure I never knew existed. I spent much of life feeling misunderstood, unseen and unheard. This meant people pleasing, perfectionism, denying the truth of who I am, self-rejection...ultimately leading to depression, anxiety and burning out.  At the root of it all? I didn't understand, hear or see myself! üí• That was 5 years ago.  I've never felt more like me than I do today.  It feels pretty good to say the least!   - Where and when do you feel misunderstood? - Do you feel unheard? Unseen? - Do you find yourself saying yes to others when you wish you could say no? - Are you constantly striving for a perfection you never seem to achieve? - Do you often feel not good enough or like you're not living the right life for you? - Do you feel like you're always trying to 'fit in'?If you can relate, if you're feeling lost and confused , get in touch for a free discovery call.  I now share with clients the tools & techniques I learned on my journey. One-to-one coaching & mentoring to discover the truth of who you are and restore vitality and joy.Powerful transformations are possible when you choose you - it just takes that first courageous step.

So I want to know ONE thing about your personality that shaped your life so far.I‚Äôll begin.Some of my high-school behavior in high school was significant enough for some teachers to have ‚Äòheard about me‚Äô before I set foot in their classrooms. Some of the ‚Äòbravery‚Äô to pull some of the stunts I did literally stemmed from me imagining how I would have responded if I were a character in a movie.My fixation on storytelling runs THAT deep. My understanding of the power of living out the story of the hero we want to be began right then as a teenager.Now.

Functions such as heartbeat, breathing, and digestion are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It transmits information from the internal organs and operates automatically.The autonomic nervous system is made up of parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system. As your sympathetic nervous system activates your body's "fight-or-flight" response, your parasympathetic nervous system facilitates digestion and rest.Since traumatized individuals are often on high alert and more sensitive to threats, their sympathetic nervous system is more likely to be activated by stress, danger, or physical activity. This constant state of alert leads to difficulties sleeping, difficulties concentrating, irritability, anger, panic, constant anxiety, and other symptoms. The following activities can help you calm your nervous system and decrease activation.  ...#nervoussystem #fightorflight #calm #therapytips #autonomicnervoussystem #mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthsupport #selflove #selflovequotes #selfcare #selfcaretips #selfloveclub #therapy #depression #depressionhelp #anxiety #anxietyawareness #anxietyrelief #anxietyhelp #anxietyrecovery #apartmenttherapy #trauma #traumahealing #traumainformed #telehealthcare #psychologytoday #californiatherapy

Some antidepressants may cause problems if you have certain mental or physical health conditions. On the other hand, certain antidepressants may help treat other physical or mental health conditions along with depression. For example, many antidepressants may relieve symptoms of anxiety disorders. Bupropion may help you stop smoking. Other examples include using duloxetine to help with pain symptoms or fibromyalgia, or using amitriptyline to prevent migraines.Make an appointment üìÖ with me today to discuss your options when it comes to improving your health!  https://bit.ly/GHHcall#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #anxiety #love #mentalhealthmatters #depression #motivation #health #wellness #mindfulness #healing #fitness #life #loveyourself #therapy #inspiration #happiness #mindset #positivity #positivevibes #meditation #mentalillness #psychology #wellbeing #happy

And while it‚Äôs important to talk about these topics, it can sometimes feel like that‚Äôs all there is to psychology. ü§åüèªBut the reality is that there‚Äôs so much more to psychology than just trauma and mental illness. There‚Äôs a whole other side to psychology that talks about happiness, wellbeing, gratitude, and other positive topics.

You can You Spot The Red Flags In Your Relationship....It's a hard pill to swallow at times to admit that there are red flags in our relationship. And so, as a defense mechanism, we often don't allow ourselves to see them until it's too late. Being able to spot them is important though, as they can help avoid heartache and staying in a dysfunctional relationship longer than you need to, or indeed start one! Most people in toxic relationships know their relationships aren‚Äôt ideal, but they justify and rationalize their doubts away. Normalization makes them feel, ‚Äúthis is not so bad, and they promised to change‚Ä¶.‚Äù and they hang in there way too long.But you don't need to stay stuck.It's time to identify those signs.

Let's have some fun for a minute.¬†I have a question for you...Tell me...Who is the alter ego of Clark Kent?Take your time to think about it...If you are like all people I asked thisquestion before, you probably answered......'Superman!' Right?(By the way my top superhero.)But...That is not the right answer. Realize,that being Superman is the guy's nature.¬†His natural state is being a superman...Actually 'Clark Kent' is the alter egoof Superman.And... this is how most of us live...We have great potential, great superpowers,which are our natural state...our nature.¬†But we are living most of our lives in our alter¬†ego of someone, who is weak, who is suffering......thinking that that is who we are.Mistaking our alter ego, with our natural state...Life is so precious. I help people to come back¬†to their natural state... to be alive again,using their full potential.I believe that helping people realize thetruth behind their true nature is the bestway I can make a difference in the world...That's why I want to invest my time and effortin you, so you can leave your alter ego, andstart living a real life... the one you alwaysdesired.Hit comment, and tell me what is resonatingin you right now... or... even better...Let's have a call...I offer a free online session... just make¬†an appointment here...https://lnkd.in/ej-eKw9k...and show up.

Managing our #anxiety and nervous system is essential when it comes to #optimum_performance, and breath exercises are a major tool for that . #box_breathing is one of the best ways to practice mindful breathing. It‚Äôs very simple and can be done as soon as we feel any discomfort. It is astonishing how by repeating this cycle a few times we calm down. By focusing on counting on the breath not only do we become more present but we switch to our rest and digest mode. Our #nervous_system calms down and we feel less stressed and anxious. When we are calm and relaxed we make better decision and manage better üòÉTry this one a day at least and see the impact on your mood and general well being.

#SOLUTION TO #WORRY -Small story about Buddha and his disciples:One day Buddha arrived for his usual morning discourse with his disciples. He had a knotted handkerchief in his hand. He showed the handkerchief to the disciples and asked if any of themcould come up and untie the knot. One disciple went up and tried to untie it. He pulled and pulled and the knot tightened. Another disciple went up, he looked at the knot for a few seconds and easily untied it. All he did was look at the knot and immediately he knew how the knot was made in the first place. So, he just reversed the whole thing and untied it! The knot itself taught him how to untie it. In life worries are the knots in the handkerchief. If we look at them with awareness, we will know how to dissolve them. We will see exactly how the worry was created and then know how to ‚Äòuntie‚Äô it. The worry itself will teach us how to release it. First of all, there is no need to worry. Life itself holds all the solutions. It is a beautiful self-sustaining mechanism. We just need to allow it to function in its natural way. Then we will awaken to its higher intelligence and drop all our worries. Not only that, when we witness, our mind slows down. Worry itself causes the mind to rush around in what you call anxiety. When awareness is brought in, the rushing slows down and things happen as they should.#anxiety #LIFE #stress #frustration #anger #depression #nithyananda #kailasa

As an entrepreneur, speaker, therapist, coach, and SOOO much more, I fiercely protect my time with family on #slowsundays. Why? Because...1. I don't buy into the story of a business owner needing to hustle 24/7 to be successful. That is a fast journey to Chronic Stress and Burnout. 2. My strongest love language is quality time with my people and that bucket needs to be filled!3. I made a decision to live what I teach and to serve my clients well I need to be designing an exciting life, not just following bullshit rules that crush people.And if that isn't enough...I do it because I CHOOSE IT üòç#mindfulimpact #taniadavies #successslowcoach #ceocoach #strategicallyslow #slowdown #reclaimyourlife #successintheslowlane #corporatehealth #womenentrepreneurs #womeninleadership #womeninbusiness #freedomlifestyle #busyisntbetter #busymom #busylife #happy #theslowlanesuccesssystem #rushingwomensyndrome #anxiety #depression #overwhelm #procrastination #perfectionist #subconsciousmind #overthinking

#relationships #change #anxiety Regardless of the achievement, the main concern will relate to which of our personal dreams are likely to remain just that: unfulfilled dreams. Of course, there is no certainty that one is never going to be famous or a millionaire, but, if these things have not yet occurred within the preferred time frame, all seems lost at this stage.¬†Thus the type of choices we make at this time will determine if we are in a mid-life crisis or a mid-life transition.  #transition #selfawareness #midlifecrisis #distress

Cycling is an excellent exercise and also promotes good posture and balance. Initially individuals with Fragile X may struggle to achieve cycling, but once learnt, they love it. Children with Fragile X Syndrome have a low muscle tone and may even take fewer years to start to walk and run after innumerable therapies. Having a low muscle tone and gross motor and fine motor challenges makes a simple activity like cycling a huge achievement. At the end of the day when a child has learned a skill, the child is happy and it‚Äôs worth the effort.....#fragilexsyndrome #fragilexawareness #anxiety #cycling #games #skills #fragilexindia #autism #autismawareness #specialneeds #fxs #fxtas #fxpoi #sensoryprocessingdisorder #spd #sensory #trending #explore #awareness #fragilex #Iamwithfragilex

Continuing our conversations around pacifying Vata through the senses‚Ä¶ to calm the potentially anxious Vata mind through the sense of smell we look to surround ourselves with scents that are fruity and floral in nature. Wear them, burn then in diffuser‚Äôs or incense/candles and choose aromas like orange, geranium, rose, vanilla, patchouli and cloves to action on that busy mind. As with most holistic mindbody practices these may take time to work so use them consistently for best results and reach out with questions or comments ! #senses #smell #ayurveda #ayurvedalifestyle #vata #anxiety #mentalhealth #balance #mindbodysoul #mindbodycoach #mindbodymedicine #coaching #guide #health #wellbeing #wellness #essentialoils #aromatherapy #vancouver

Continuing de sequence of essays on adolescence, sexual identities, and anguishes in sexual life, I‚Äôm going to replay the EssayCULTURAL INLFUENCES ON IDENTITYThis Essay will be focused on cultural influences on identity aiming at a brief overview on the historical background and cultural changes among generations in order to reflect on environmental (cultural) influences on identity.POST 3CULTUREThe third Post briefly defines Culture as a meta-narrative that underlines the discovery of major truths regarding the world and human nature. In this sense, it works as a mythology of origin. I‚Äôll also refer to it as a ‚Äúsocial psychological ground‚Äù#psychology#Identity#personality#development#Ego#anguish#anxiety#sexuality#sexualidentity#environment#culturalinfluences

Some antidepressants may cause problems if you have certain mental or physical health conditions. On the other hand, certain antidepressants may help treat other physical or mental health conditions along with depression. For example, many antidepressants may relieve symptoms of anxiety disorders. Bupropion may help you stop smoking. Other examples include using duloxetine to help with pain symptoms or fibromyalgia, or using amitriptyline to prevent migraines.Make an appointment üìÖ with me today to discuss your options when it comes to improving your health!  https://bit.ly/GHHcall#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #anxiety #love #mentalhealthmatters #depression #motivation #health #wellness #mindfulness #healing #fitness #life #loveyourself #therapy #inspiration #happiness #mindset #positivity #positivevibes #meditation #mentalillness #psychology #wellbeing #happy

Today was the first ski day of the year for me, amazing snow! I got back and it was still 60 degrees here in Boulder. Lastly, I got a nice bike ride in and got a great pork belly sandwich from Masons Dumpling shop. And I finished my priorities for my #incredible91 day results challenge early!

You love your job but now it requires you to travel, and you have a fear of flying, what can you do? You don't want to tell your boss because you'll feel weak and a total failure but equally you can't face boarding an aircraft on your own. Especially as you don't know where your fear comes from... This is where I can help. I'm an ex-Flight Supervisor, turned Clinical Specialist Hypnotherapist & I flew during 9/11., so I have years of experience with nervous, anxious passengers.  In fact, there's not a lot that I haven't dealt with onboard! I personalise your transformation to your specific needs ad nobody needs to know you are getting help. This is a tailored 1-2-1 service, so you are not in a room with hundreds of strangers, making you feel even more nervous and this is not a course online where you have no human contact either. This is you and I,  working through the fear that you have subconsciously trapped, leaving you out of control of your emotions. There are lots of tools & techniques to help you out there, as there are 3 layers to the Fear of Flying: KNOWLEDGE, EVENT, and TRAUMA. I specialize in the EVENT AND TRAUMA emotions, which are the deeper feelings of the root cause, of the presenting symptom of Anxiety, Stress, and Fear of Flying. For a deeper Fear of Flying or Stress and Anxiety: You need to change the story that you have been telling yourself. Unresolved trauma will need to be addressed for you to overcome the root cause of your fear of flying permanently. You need to go subconsciously to find the real emotional root reason for your trauma. You will probably come across emotional memories, absorbing events, and life-changing times that formed your first belief about your Fear of Flying. All our beliefs are formed before the age of 8yrs. (I was a teacher after I was widowed young, which ended my flying career.) Hence, I understand how our young ‚Äòsponge-like‚Äô childhood mind, holds all our emotional answers and attachment feelings, subconsciously. It can start with a memory of a book, a film, an off-the-cuff comment, a bullying incident, or a sibling argument, the list is endless. But once those feelings are realized, because you created them, you can uncreate them. You can then reframe your Anxiety, Stress around the Fear of Flying belief... subconsciously. The conscious mind (logical mind) won't reframe a subconscious mind (emotional mind) repetitive belief, a habit of thought, or an overwhelming overthinking, that‚Äôs why you need to choose to change to empower flying confidence, subconsciously. But can you overcome your Anxiety, Stress & Fear of Flying, to gain control of that feeling trapped emotion so you can empower flying confidence. #vasktherapy #stress #anxiety #fears #overcomingfear #confidence #panic #panicattacks #fearofflying #takeoff #freakingout #trapped #feelsafe #flying #noescape #safety #outofcontrol #control #turbulence #embarrassed #businesstravel #travelforwork #nervous #feelsick #anxious #terrified #fr

My strongest love language is quality time with my people and that bucket needs to be filled!3. I made a decision to live what I teach and to serve my clients well I need to be designing an exciting life, not just following bullshit rules that crush people.And if that isn't enough...I do it because I CHOOSE IT üòç#mindfulimpact #taniadavies #successslowcoach #ceocoach #strategicallyslow #slowdown #reclaimyourlife #successintheslowlane #corporatehealth #womenentrepreneurs #womeninleadership #womeninbusiness #freedomlifestyle #busyisntbetter #busymom #busylife #happy #theslowlanesuccesssystem #rushingwomensyndrome #anxiety #depression #overwhelm #procrastination #perfectionist #subconsciousmind #overthinking

Good evening!  Happy Saturday night! üéâ.Just to let you know that on Monday I'm going live at 10am in my Facebook Group 'Katie's Classroom Parent Support' talking about masking..Children with autism can sometimes 'mask' their differences and anxieties in order to try and fit in with those around them.  Masking is more common in girls, although many boys also present with this behaviour and I have experiened this a lot recently with Bass, which I'll talk about on Monday..I'm often explaining to Bass's teacher that he may appear absolutely fine on the outside but inside he's feeling reeeeeally anxious.  Often Bass holds it together at school but then once home, where he feels safest, he releases his anxieties..Many parents describe how their child is like a ‚Äúshaken up coke bottle‚Äù when they return home from school.  Often Bass as soon as he's through the door releases what he has been holding in at school..So I thought this would be a reeeally good topic to start with as I haven't done a live since July!üò±.I really hope you can join me.  Here's the link again to my Facebook Group just in case you need it or the link is in my bio: https://lnkd.in/edie2s5v - you can watch all my videos on replay just in case you're not able to watch live....#katiesclassroom #facebookgroup #goinglive #masking #autism #autismawareness #autismacceptance #asd #adhd #specialneeds #autistic #autismmum #autismfamily #autismsupport #mentalhealth #neurodiversity #anxiety #inclusion #specialeducation

Oftentimes, children do not outgrow their fears soon enough. These persistent fears then interfere with their day-to-day activities, like studies, sports, or extra-curricular. Sometimes, this may also reflect on their relationships with their family and friends. Here are some common types of anxiety disorders in children:1. Afraid to go to school or crowded places where they would need to interact (social anxiety ).2. Afraid when separated from their parents/guardians (separation anxiety).3. Having sudden or repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by symptoms like shaking, sweating, troubled breathing, or dizziness (panic disorder).4. Afraid of certain things or situations, like dogs, needles, etc. (phobia).5. Worried about bad things happening in the future (general anxiety).If your child is displaying any such behaviors, the first thing to do will be to calm them down and talk to them about it. However, for a better response and recovery, checking out with a professional might be a good call for their future.
