Após pensar bastante se deveria ou não vir aqui fazer esse tipo de publicação, não poderia deixar passar batido.Ontem foi dia de mais um #layoff na Provi e dessa vez meu nome estava na lista.Após um longo período em busca de recolocação até o início desse ano, eu encontrei a Provi em um match perfeito de vaga/gestão e cheia de sonhos pela frente. Tive o prazer de me conectar com pessoas incríveis desde a primeira entrevista e fui muito realizada nesses quase 9 meses de casa onde pude ser eu mesma, me desafiei diariamente e fui promovida no 6º mês de empresa.Agradeço especialmente a todo o time de Pessoas e Cultura por terem me recebido tão bem (Jessica Godoi Taiz Benevides Ana Beatriz Leite ✊🏾 Manuela Silva Ferreira Gabriela Oliveira Edilaine Santos Edilaine). Obrigada Anna Heloisa Fernandes por sempre estar disposta a me ajudar e me acolher em momentos difíceis.Um agradecimento mais que especial ao Luiz Fernandes ✊🏾 🏳️‍🌈que me deu a tão esperada notícia do "sim" e conduziu meu processo da melhor forma possível.Carlos Mazzarolo pela parceria e disposição, por me auxiliar de diversas formas e nem ter noção disso. Você é demais e tem um coração enorme!E Aithya Rose Macena você foi incrível, do início ao fim! Admiro muito sua gestão, sua forma de lidar e querer melhorar sempre como pessoa e líder. Obrigada por me encorajar e confiar em mim de olhos fechados desde o primeiro dia. E como não estive sozinha nesse layoff, temos mais pessoas desligadas da Provi nessa lista, profissionais incríveis e competentes:https://lnkd.in/dnqwX3aUObrigada por tudo Provi! Foi incrível criarmos pontes de acesso a educação juntos!E agora vem um novo recomeço: estou #opentowork
-----------------------------
Foi um ciclo maravilhoso e de muitos aprendizados na Dock e eu só tenho a agradecer essa empresa que me mostrou uma cultura sensacional, que se importavam tanto com seu funcionário. Fico triste por esse momento de #layoff que pegou a mim e alguns colegas de surpresa. Mas garanto que levarei uma bagagem enorme de lá.Obrigado a tudo e a todos meus colegas que trabalham ao meu lado.Bora para o próximo desafio…
-----------------------------
Há algumas (poucas) semanas atrás, compartilhei uma mudança legal que tinha acontecido comigo na Provi e, infelizmente, hoje venho dizer que também faço parte da lista de pessoas que foram desligadas no ultimo #layoff. Por um instante pensei em nao fazer essa publicação, confesso que senti ate um pouco de vergonha, como se eu que tivesse cometido algum erro, e isso me fez refletir sobre como temos que ter atenção sobre a maneira que lidamos com as nossas relações de trabalho. Aqui nao falo sobre dedicação, nao me arrependo de ter dado 110% de mim nessa empresa pq, alem de acreditar no propósito do que fazia, eu nao sei ser diferente e sempre me entrego em tudo o que me proponho a fazer. Tambem nao falo de um lugar de mágoa, foi uma jornada incrível que me trouxe amizades que levo pra vida, que me guiou para um outro caminho enquanto profissional, mais madura e resiliente, compartilhando meu dia a dia com profissionais engajados, com muita bagagem e extremamente competentes, eu cresci demais. So que também nao consigo romantizar essa despedida. A frustração existe, como explicar uma movimentação de cargo seguida de uma demissão em menos de 20 dias? É um mix de sentimentos conflituosos que eu nao desejo pra ninguém.Pelo menos pra mim, essa situação toda serve como um lembrete de que nós definitivamente nao somos o nosso trabalho e que nada vale mais do que o nosso bem estar. Que é preciso ter atenção com as prioridades e concessões que fazemos. Priorizar o que verdadeiramente importa (e não um CNPJ). Por fim, gostaria de comunicar que estou disponível para novas oportunidades, e agradecer por todos que dividiram as dores e as delícias que foi abraçar esse caos neste quase 1 ano e meio de Provi. Podem ter certeza que todos impactaram positivamente na minha trajetória ate aqui.

Week 2 of a #layoff is sometimes harder than the first. As the reality of the situation and explorations start to sift out for those let go, as the dust settles and new workloads become clear for those left, it’s hard to adjust to the new realities of our lives.Remember to be kind to the people who you’re reaching out to on both ends - these situations are never easy for either side. We’ll all wade through this #together. #empathy #kindnessmatters

The saying goes, "It's not what you know, it's who you know."  Well, I think it's actually a combination of both.  For anyone I know, or connected to me on this platform, I'm sure you know something good. You probably offer a lot of valuable experience.  Some of you may also be suddenly out of a job. I've been out of work before. A few times. As the sole breadwinner in my family (both in and out of recessions) it's was a scary, hard, and stressful position to find myself in. Finding the next opportunity required a lot of diligence, a good system, and a sometimes little luck. But, it's the connections that have made the difference each and every time.  And every new job took me to even better places. If I can be helpful connecting your "what" to any of the "who's" in my network -- please DM me. And don't be shy. You are not alone.  #strongertogether #tech #layoff #helpothers

Who's ready for another #layoff post?! This morning, my entire #employerbranding team was let go despite the immeasurable impact the 3 of us made in one short year together.  From the get-go, we perfectly rounded one another out & slid into our respective areas of expertise with unbelievable ease.  We advocated for each other & we advocated for everyone at the company together.I've never before been part of such a remarkable team.I'm absolutely heartbroken to have to leave the many amazing colleagues & friends I have at commercetools, but as Dorothy said to Scarecrow, "I think I'll miss you most of all."   Maike Caroline Hartung, Maria Galan👉 That said, I'm now in pursuit of my next opportunity in Employer Branding, Recruitment Marketing, Employee Experience, etc. & I appreciate any hands you can lend in my search.BUT, if you are a company that sees the value in Employer Branding & could use a motivated & passionate team of 3 with a combined 20+ years of experience in this niche field, we are ready & willing to come as a package deal! 📦  (We're kind of like a trio of bonded kittens who'd love to go to the same home. 😉🐱)#employeeexperience #recruitmentmarketing #talentbrand #peopleandculture

In a month where my feed has already been flooded by layoffs, I was also laid off. I’m grateful for the leadership, decision making, and problem solving skills I was able to grow from rapidly launching innovation on e-commerce, creating new cross-functional processes, engaging with retail customers, and especially from managing a small but mighty team.It’s a challenging economic environment, so restructuring and refocusing priorities are happening all over the place. For those of us facing these challenges, it’s hard. First, take a breath. Then, when ready, remember every challenge is also an opportunity, and we can’t see what is next just yet. The workplace has evolved so much in the past 3 years…. I’m excited to uncover what’s next for me and find the right place to continue growing my career. I am open to work and ready to talk all things brand, marketing and innovation. I’m looking for another company that cares about its people and is on a mission to improve consumer’s lives through innovation.In the meantime, I will take advantage of a different opportunity - extra time with the baby.#layoff #opentowork

Day 2 in my new role, and the work culture at Viant Technology has been nothing short of amazing.  It's been great to be working here in our Irvine office and getting to know my fellow colleagues.Having been through a #layoff myself recently, I can only imagine the anxiety that many individuals are either going through before the layoffs happen, as well as the hurt that comes with after either losing their jobs or losing their colleagues.  Given today's layoff culture, it makes me appreciate #Viant even more.  Over a 2 year period in which big tech couldn't hire fast enough (and ironically looking to undo the damages of over-hiring), Viant has positioned ourselves to weather this storm, keep our workforce happily employed, and ready to scale hiring across multiple departments in a thoughtful way.  As we look to build out our #engineering and #product departments, we are looking to hire one more Senior #TechnicalRecruiter to our #TalentAcquisition team to work in a hybrid capacity in either our #LosAngeles or #Irvine location.  Send me a quick note/comment so that we can review.  If it's the right match, let's connect!

My heart breaks every time I see a new post informing the world about a fresh round of layoffs, because I know what it means for those affected. So even if you don't know me, I will be here for you if you need support. Reach out and you'll hear back. Here are some lessons that I've learned from my own recent layoff experience. I hope you find them helpful:Take time to mourn. You've experienced a profound loss. Don't just jump into the job search to cover up the pain - it will only prolong it. Do your very best not to blame yourself or question if there was something you could have done to prevent this. It will only exasperate the pain. This one's hard, at least it is for me, but remember that you are so much more than your job or the title you held. You're not just a designer, developer, product manager, director ... you are a person rich with unique and valuable experiences. You are still you. Connect with your network. It's okay if you have not reached out in a decade - people are happy to hear from you and most will be willing to help you. Ask them to connect you with recruiters and hiring managers in their organizations. This will get you much closer to your next great role. Reach out to strangers on LinkedIn whose experience or role you respect and want to learn more about. They will surprise and inspire you. They will help you see yourself in a whole new light. They will remind you that you're actually pretty great.And you really are great. Don't forget that. And don't forget that a healthy mind and a healthy body go hand-in-hand. Take the time, every day, to do something for your body and your mind. #jobsearch #layoffs #help #linkedin #layoff #network

To everyone who has LI messaged or emailed me thank you so much! I am running a little behind on all the responses, but know you are sitting Starred in my Inbox. The flood of support and kind words has me feeling so #grateful for this network.To all #stripes going through this, there is hope and the market is moving, so take all the calls you can! I've learned two things in the past few weeks.1/ Don't let the unknown and #layoff define you. You are worthy and we were hired for a reason.2/ There are jobs! Regardless of the holidays and perception of the market, there are tons of people hiring! I got some sound advice from a HM last week and what she said is helping me be more thoughtful with the process. "Don't jump to the first offer, figure out what YOU want." I think most of you going through this know and feel the anxiety I'm dealing with daily with financials and family.Everyone hang in there and know I am here if you need to chat talking through the experience has helped me greatly so I can return the favor please message me! Thank you again everyone and happy Tuesday!#openforwork #hireme #layoffs #hopeforthefuture

Hello LinkedIn!!! Layoffs have always been brutal for everyone. Whenever there are layoffs, or any project gets ended or cancelled, I have seen my friends and people around the globe we have worked with for years go their separate ways. Yet looking back, whenever we start working on a new day, all I can say is that each day, I feel blessed because it is another 24 hours that I can try again. This is the life of a professional, and I have no regrets. All I can say is when things happen that seem like the world is crashing, look back to your first day. That first successful interview. That first project and remember how excited you were. Here is a chance to live that over again or, better yet, take a different exciting direction and we are a global family that can help each other by spending a few minutes. If you are in North America and looking for a new project in any domain, please reach out to me and I will be delighted to talk to you as it always gives me happiness to connect with talented people out there and achieve great things together.Looking forward to connecting with you!!!#layoff #people #project #layoffs #interview

Lots of core "humanism" here like understanding emotions and personalization. Really great content that I found relevant for all levels at all times but especially useful during change and uncertainty.  Even if you're not managing people, or perhaps you've been impacted by recent change, there's some fodder here that will help you understand emotions and visualize the change process.  Highly recommend.  TY Lars Schmidt & anon-CPO. :clapping:#layoffs #layoff #RIF #communication

I've only been working at Terra.do for a month, but it didn't take a month for me to fall in love with their heart & human-first approach to providing the tools and empowerment everyone needs to affect change in the climate crisis.I've known for a long time that individual action doesn't push the needle and recycling is a lie, so I thought the only collective action I could participate in was voting and activism (both still V important). But there's a third! You can work in climate.The team at Terra.do genuinely wants to help everyone transition their career into climate – and it's been eye-opening just how many roles in climate there really are (especially those for people like me coming from the humanities and human sciences)!If you've been recently laid off and are trying to navigate finding a job in climate, or even what that means, DM me – it's my full-time job to get people to work in climate, and I would love to help you everywhere I can!#career #layoff #climatejobs #climatetech

É muito muito difícil ver todos os seus colegas, amigos, parceiros de trabalho -e de vida- sem chão simplesmente do nada. O movimento de #layoff ou #downsizing tem sido altamente discutido recentemente. Há consequências obvias para quem sai, mas não podemos esquecer que há também consequências para a empresa. O #bemestar dos (ex) colaboradores é o mais importante e com fé na #qualidade absurda que esses profissionais tem (e eu sei que tem mesmo), já já estarão bem alocados ou prestando consultoria, mostrando o melhor de si pro mercado! Eu confio - e recomendo! -  O #time de #design da Dock -ou ex time de Design que acabou de acabar- em particular é um dos times mais #integrados, #inteligentes e #produtivos que já vi. Qualquer empresa que realmente queira #inovar, criar, pesquisar, testar, vai se surpreender com a qualidade desses profissionais. Do #Junior ao #Senior. Criamos uma rede de #aprendizagem colaborativa e consistente. O time de Design poderia ser sozinho uma consultoria rsrs Não to fazendo apenas #marketing & #vendas é que o #product & #service é bom mesmo :) rsrs Aos colegas que estão sem chão, contem comigo! Tenham fé na potência que vocês são. Aos que ficam, meus sentimentos. Espero que consigam superar essa enorme perda. Contem comigo também! Vamos nos fortalecer. Pra fechar com #spoiler:[O universo foi especialmente bom comigo e me deu uma oportunidade desafiadora que contarei nas cenas dos próximos capítulos]. Um beijo e força nesse novo ciclo! Que nenhuma empresa seja capaz de tirar o melhor que vocês tem: #Empatia, #Criatividade e #Colaboração <3  Dedicação especial aos marcados nos comentários.

I was caught in a #layoff, but I'm telling myself that at least it wasn't personal. I learned a lot during my time at Domino and everyone I worked with was consistently knowledgeable, friendly, and hard-working. I'm currently seeking #technicalwriter roles. At Domino I wrote on #cloudcomputing, #operations, #kubernetes, and, during my 3 years at Microsoft, I covered many areas of #cybersecurity (among other things, I helped with the major effort to disseminate information about the SolarWinds supply chain attacks). I love learning new things so I'm up for exploring other areas as well. Feel free to comment, share, or send me a detailed message!

Do not shame people who accept or consider offers to return after a lay off. I don't know their stories. i don't know their bills that gotta be paid.I don't know who they caregive. I don't know why they need health care insurance. I don't know a lot about them and their lives and needs. and neither do you. If you are so privileged that you've never prayed, hoped, considered, or accepted a layoff return: congrats. Now do the work to make that true for everyone. Til then. Build your compassion and hold your dumb, ignorant thoughts about them to yourself.For anyone considering or accepting a return offer from any of the companies that just laid you off: I see you. I support you. Make the choice best for you, right now. Then please do whatever you need to return power of your income, health care, and peace of mind to yourself.You deserve all that and so much more.  #people #healthcare #insurance #power #layoffs #layoff #buildyourbrave #braveitup #womenintech #womenintechnology #Twitter #northwesternmutual #f5 #techlayoff #techlayoffs #womeninstem #bravecoach #bravecoaching #privileged #decisions

⚠️Not every brand can replicate Airbnb ‘s approach of focusing on brand vs performance marketing They’ve spent a lot of time and resources on getting their BASICS right#airbnb is a great example of a brand that discovered a new need and offered a solution for it. Like the classic definition of marketing: articulating a need the consumer doesn’t know they have, till they see a product/service offering a solution.As income levels increased globally, air travel became affordable, and the likes of Anthony Bourdain popularized travel, the need to not only travel somewhere but really, truly immerse in the local culture, was what Airbnb offered.No surprises that their brand building investments are working hard for them. ✅ A few things that make it possible for Airbnb to be successful:1. A strong BRAND PURPOSE : ‘Belong Anywhere’ takes travel from just visiting a place to really ‘be’ in the place and have as close an experience to being a ‘local’ as possible, truly be a part of that local ‘community’2. Strong BRAND EXPERIENCES: all their products then ladder up to this brand purpose. Everything from ‘experiences’ to ‘categories’ to ‘air cover’ traces back to ‘Belong Anywhere’3. Strong BRAND COMMUNICATION : finally, all content highlights these products and the ‘feeling’ of belonging and community. Right down to airbnb.org that offered free housing for refugees and front line workers during Covid Brian Chesky’s heartfelt letter to employees when they had to #layoff employees during #covid was yet another example of staying true to their brand of ‘community’ and making it as seamless as possible, in a tough situation. #marketing #brand #communication #purpose #brandexperience # #brandbuilding #alenusa #grupoalen

It's heartbreaking to watch CEO's I've admired my entire adult career terminate thousands of employees with NO remorse or NO accountability. The shocking lack of regret in their crafted PR statements is impossible to ignore as "choices" made by these leaders have caused so much destruction. Dedicated employees are losing their livelihoods, houses, ability to provide for their families but I have yet to see a dedicated effort towards outplacement support for laid off employees. Frankly, it's embarrassing to witness the lack of employment assistance or layoff/recession planning considering 2021 was the highest record setting year for the consumer technology industry with sales reaching nearly $127 billion dollars, up 9% from 2020's tremendous results years in the tech industry. Layoffs may be out of the employees control and is expected to happen 1-3 times a career in every industry but with all due respect,  leader to leader DO BETTER. I teach organizations & job seekers everyday how to plan & recover  for a unexpected layoff so if you don't have a layoff or career transitions plan in place yet, book your free consultations here to get started: https://lnkd.in/dHt_RS2w#layoff #layoffsandjobreductions #leadershipmatters #recession #twitter #elonmusknews LAID OFF JOB SEEKERS PLEASE READ: YOU ARE WORTHY.YOU DESERVE TO GRIEVE.

Since I have been on this hunt for a couple of months now.Apply directly on the company's website I have received little to no traction applying on Linkedin or Indeed.Just use it as an announcement board if you are lucky the recruiter might be listed next to the position.

And keep applying even if it sounds like you are going to get the job keep applying for new roles.Don't settle unless you have an offer letter even then don't settle. #job #recruiter #linkedin #jobhunt #empathy #layoff #helpinghands #beleiveinyourself #lookingforopportunities

Suatu hari sepasang suami istri sama sama bekerja,Seperti biasa, sang suami menjemput istrinya untuk pulang bersama,Ditengah perjalanan, sang istri bercerita tentang apa yang ia lalui di kantornya,dan sang suami berujar "kamu ngeluh mulu ga resign resign"Akhirnya sang istri diam, Di lain cerita,sang anak pulang sekolah dengan riangnya, ia menceritakan kesehariannya di sekolah oleh ibunya, belum mendengar sepenuhnya, sang ibu berkata "ibu capek ah, gausah berisik"akhirnya sang anak tidak lagi bercerita kepada sang ibu,Dari kedua cerita diatas,Kita bisa membaca bahwa tidak semua bisa menjadi tempat pulang kita,Tapi setidaknya,sebelum kita lah yang terlanjur kecewa atau membentuk seribu kata diam,ada baiknya kita pastikan bahwa kita adalah "tempat pulang terbaik untuk orang orang sekitar kita"Meskipun dikepala kita sendiri tidak pernah berhenti mencari makna, percayalah bahwa Allah itu baik,Allah lah satu satunya tempat kita untuk pulang,Jangan sampai,kita terlena dan Allah ambil pasangan/anak anak kita,Menyesal selalu terjadi belakangan kawan....#management #layoff #motivated #leadership #inspiring

How to get #opportunities in your inbox without applying:🌟 SHOWCASE your KNOWLEDGE - You have certain knowledge 🧠  or experience ⏳️that most others don't. Yes, YOU.You don't have to be an expert, just share what you know. Share it and become an authoritative source of information in your field. Ex, 1. Got rejected in an #interview? Share what you learned. 2. Know a cool app that helps saves time? share it.3. Share your thoughts about a trending news and show how your expertise can help.🌟  CREATE a COMMUNITY - If you are looking for an opportunity within a company that's #hiring for your dream role, engage with their posts, find people who are currently in roles that match your interest, create a conversation and understand what they value. Create conservations, learn and share what you learned. People will follow once you consistently provide valuable content or engage with them.Have #fun meeting and learning from like minded people!For ex, if you are an #engineer contribute to the open source of the company you are targeting.🌟 Gain CREDIBILITY - Start a brand, create a Linkedin Page, create newsletters or courses. Seek out opportunities to speak, guest author articles in media etc.The more conversations you create, the more value you provide by sharing what you know, the bigger your network will become and faster you will build credibility among your community. 🌟 Attract OPPORTUNITIES - Once you gain credibility, opportunities you once wanted will soon come to your inbox. One such opportunity for me was the LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Program. I was provided an incredible opportunity by LinkedIn for Creators to share the knowledge and experience I've gained so far. They've provided me the tools and the support to spark conversations and share my knowledge.As a result:🌟 Recieved mutiple messages from recruiters for job opportunities which I never applied to. (I love my current role so I passed the opportunities over the others in the field)🌟 My following has increased 50%🌟 Recieved opportunities to speak 🌟 Recieved opportunities to serve on boards of non-profit orgs.🌟 Access to exclusive conferences such as the Forbes CIO Next Summit and networking opportunities with C-suite.⚠️Takeway⚠️1. Remember, we all started with 0 followers and 0 connections. Even MrBeast and the most followed LinkedIn member Bill Gates started with 0.2. You don't need fancy equipments or need to be an expert. You just need a phone or a laptop to get started on your knowledge sharing journey.Create your opportunities!#createonlinkedin #licreatoraccelerator #job #Twitter #peloton #zillow #docusign #layoff #Ford #Meta #office #litrendingtopics

Mass #layoff is tough, for both employees and employers. I have been through it before, and I still remember the feeling of walking into the same building but no longer seeing the same faces there. My heart goes out to all that have been impacted, and I would like to do my part to help anyone in need. As an HR professional, I am happy to provide support in resume review, interview prep or networking. Also, at Innovusion we continue to #hire in #mechanicalengineering, #electricalengineering, #product marketing, #producement, #technicalprogrammanagement, and #fieldapplication. Check out our career page at https://lnkd.in/gwMYRKjG or DM me. Together we'll make it through and become stronger and better.
-----------------------------
For anyone who has gotten or is in the process of getting #laidoff, below are the immediate logistical steps that will soften the landing and give yourself the best shot at coming out the other side intact.Ask #hr  for a #layoff  letter A layoff letter is used when a #company needs to #terminate an #employee for reasons that were not directly caused by their own action or performance. Restructuring, economic downturns, mergers, etc. Now you request knowing that eventually you will interview again and inevitably the recruiter will ask you why you left your last company.You will be able to present them with evidence that you were laid off, which to a #recruiter  is the #professional equivalent of a presidential pardon.Check In On #severance Negotiating your way out of a company is as important as negotiating your way in.  Companies usually offer severance as a gesture of good will…Annnnd also because employees have to sign a release agreeing not to seek further compensation or pursue legal action, as part of the separation agreement. Do some research to find out which severance benefits you can reasonably expect from your company, and then do your best to maximize them.Register for #unemployment Being laid off entitles you to unemployment. Your eligibility, how much you will receive and how long you will be covered vary depending on where you live. But generally you’re able to apply for unemployment online, simply go to your favorite search engine and type in “Department of labor - unemployment benefits - city, state”That will take you to a website where you can submit your application and soften the landing while you look for your next gig. Tap Your #Network, #optimize  Your LinkedIn#linkedin  is a giant eco system of recruiters, former #colleagues, and generally good folks who will extend the proverbial olive branch your direction if given the chance.Your job is to make it:Easy for them to find you via a keyword rich and update profileEasy for them to refer, because you already have everything polished and ready to go.Check out the RubberDuck Recruiter on YouTube for a full length video that also covers the financial and emotional aspects of a layoff.

Still hard to believe that I was amongst 50% of the employees affected due to layoffs at Twitter. I got logged off company Gmail and slack in the evening along with my whole amazing teammates. No communication or notice.We together have achieved so much together: Twitter Professional Accounts from 0 to 11 Million in less than 2 years, shipping more awesome features for businesses and creators.... It was a true privilege to work with such a talented, hardworking, and kind group of people at Twitter.

Data Science interview questions What are the differences between over-fitting and under-fitting?In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a model to a set of training data to make reliable predictions on general untrained data.A statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship in overfitting.Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfitted has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data.Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data.Underfitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to non-linear data. Such a model, too, would have poor predictive performance. #hupry is hiring; follow the Linkedin Page for the detailsFollow #hupry 👉 https://lnkd.in/eifJ6ypC#hupry #cybersecurity #privacy #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #ai #aiforgood #aiforall #ml #bigdata #datascience #dataanalytics #dataanalysis #data #datasecurity #datagovernance #financialservices #healthcare #scienceandtechnology #privacycompliance #privacycompliance #deeptech #deeplearning #devops #neuralnetworks #layoffs #layoff #engineers #java #javascript #python #mathematics

For many people, their identity is tied to their #job or the organization they work in and so is their income. As more companies #layoff employees to "cut costs and improve profitability," it's important that people experiencing job loss have support.

Stripe's leadership just takes every opportunity to confirm they're great - in good and bad times alike. It's truly rare to see this mix of taking responsibility & proactively managing the impacts of a hard decision. As more companies are faced with making cuts, how they handle the layoff process speaks volumes about culture and leadership. Contrast this kind of messaging with the chaos and speculation swarming around Twitter and ask yourself: where would you rather work?#technology #recession #layoff #leadership #opportunity #culture

~50 Days left in 2022 - #layoff  vs #upskill Companies like #Twitter, #apple , #meta , and other big tech companies together fired thousands of employees in last few months. However, these companies consider long term engagement with its employee as their core value.Master strategy seem to be layoff the resources which were been training or nurtured over the years to cut down #operating cost, where are those #operatingmodel seem like a bubbleMid 2021 year of human loss, companies were putting huge investment in #upskill the resources for future assignment. On one side upskill will increase the bottom-line and other side layoff will further additionally burden to the company.Its high time for management needs to think inside out of managing #generationz  resource.  In India, small or medium business keep the workflow remain intact even their margin are affected, as they believe that community growth is the true meaning of growing business.We need to learn from these SME & MSBE to drive healthy growthPS: I believe Layoff & Upskilling are sweet tooth which will define the future path.

Are #layoffs legal🤔?In the legal process of layoffs, companies need to write✍️ for the labour department of government mentioning reasons for the layoff request.Labour department of government accepts the request for layoff, only if it is proven that there is harm to the survival of the company.But, large MNC's will never😳 have the trouble in survival. Their profit margin gets dropped👎 if they don't have projects to work on. So, they do plan for layoffs to bring down the company's expenditure.Labour department of any government will not accept👏 the layoff request If the motive behind layoffs is just to improve the company's profit margin and cost cutting.So, companies(Big MNC's) conduct internal layoffs(They ask their employees to resign else they terminate them explaining xyz reason)😯. The major reasons they exhibit for the employees termination😥 include low performance, fake documents, shortage of skills etc..#layoff #recession #softwareengineerjobs #coderlife #coderslife #softwareengineers #programminglife #programmers #programmingmemes #recession2023 #twitterlayoffs #sde #dsacoding #dsa #cpp #codinglife

Last Thursday was a challenging day for me and many of my colleagues/friends. My role was unfortunately impacted by the company wide layoff at Lyft. Nevertheless, I’ve humbled by all the love I’ve received over the past few days, and I’m thankful for everything I learned from working here!It is an extremely hard time for me as a H1B visa holder who has to leave the country if I can’t find a new job within 60 days of unemployment (Lyft would keep us on the payroll till end of year, then 60 days). Plus, I just started my family this year, and have mortgage to pay. Having to leave the country and my family would be devastating for me. I’m currently looking for data and analytics related roles in which I have 4+ years industry experience. With the drastic turn down of the job market and the upcoming holiday season, I would appreciate any help I can get from this community. If you are hiring or would like to share open positions, please feel free to comment below or message me on LinkedIn and email me at xinrsu1206@gmail.com #layoff #lyft #h1bvisa #dataanalytics

"recruiters are nothing but bottom feeders"I get why it can seem like this but that's not necessarily the case.. I celebrated my birthday last Friday but really wasn't in much mood because of the epic layoffs last week. Believe me when I say there's more pain to come. Layoffs MIGHT be necessary but they MUST be done right. I don't feel a lot of companies have done it right and it does a disservice to the candidate and to the industry.Did you know that if an international candidate is laid off in the states they only have between 60 or 90 days to find a new job? I can't remember which it is. Think of the level of stress that candidate faces. With so much pain on the streets, there's the opportunity to earn loads of money. there's ALSO the opportunity to be a human being and lend a listening ear and try to see if we can get the necessary help and referrals alongside your network. a good recruiter won't just shove you into a box and treat you as a number or look at you in dollars and cents. This is your CAREER and LIFE.I'm glad to have a strong team and network to refer candidates to. Please reach out to me asap if you need any help. If you call and I miss your call, leave a message and I'll give you a call back. realistically, I won't be able to place every candidate out there. no one will. But at the very least I can give you a referral, my network or a listening ear. I'm open 24-7 to any job seeker that needs help right now and have opportunities in project/product management, software, tech, devops, UIUX, artificial intelligence, machine learning and cybersecurity. It might seem like the end. I assure you it isn't. stay safe and stay strong my friends.#team #job #opportunity #network #help #recruiters #money #staysafe #hiring #firing #layoffs #layoff #redundancy #dontgiveup #referral #network #connection #candidate #jobseeker #employee #employment #career #software #opportunities #tech #project #cybersecurity #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #productmanagement #devops #recruiter

I am not sure why everyone is surprised at this point. Profits are down from this point last year.  It is hard for them not to be.  Last year at this point the frenzy was still ON AT FULL BLAST in the #legalindustry and #biglaw, #midsizedlaw #smalllaw, EVERYONE was driving just as fast as they could to get everything on their collective plates to the market as quickly as possible.  #lateralhiring was at an all-time frenzy.  Firms were almost at the point of hiring anyone with a pulse.But the corporate market has S L O W E D!!! There is now a significant bloat of very highly paid #associates and #counsel and #nonequitypartners at almost every #biglawfirm (#midsizedlawfirms are happy to hire them).  And #partners see them as a reason behind the hit to their compensation. Something has to give.  Sure, every law firm would MUCH rather #repurpose as many attorneys as they can.  Why?  Several reasons come immediately to mind:                  1. The 2008 bloodletting of massive numbers of associates (even whole departments at a time) did HUGE negative PR blows to certain firms that they are only now just                   beginning to get out ahead of.  NO ONE wants any part of that; or                  2.  It is very expensive to recruit a new candidate to join their team when such a candidate is needed.  Not just the recruiting effort in finding and onboarding that                    candidate, but also the opportunity cost of the particular partner who has identified the need for a candidate and who must work without that "body" while the search                    unfolds.So, a #lawfirm is first going to see if they can #repurpose candidates, only choosing to #layoff candidates as the last resort. But, make no mistake, #biglaw WILL be engaging in #layoffs.  Most, however, will be engaging in #stealthlayoffs.

[+SEU ENGAJAMENTO PODE AJUDAR NA MINHA REALOCAÇÃO+] Oi, família do Linkedin! Meu nome é Lucas, mas todos me conhecem como Oliver. Para quem não me conhece, é um prazer imenso!Hoje com muita tristeza encerro um ciclo incrível e inexplicável na empresa onde atuava. Foram quase 2 anos entregando experiências incríveis para milhares de clientes, liderando o time mais sensacional que poderia imaginar ter e desenvolvendo trabalhos que levarei para toda minha vida profissional.Atuo com experiência do cliente, atendimento e hospitalidade há pouco mais de 10 anos. Já fui coordenador de eventos, gerente de 2 dos maiores hostels de São Paulo e recentemente líder de CX em uma startup inovadora. Estudei Design de Jogos Digitais (onde fui aluno de destaque em 2018), além de um pouco de Gestão de Eventos e A&D de Sistemas. Sei liderar grandes equipes com empatia, focado em crescer junto e equilibrar os interesses do time com as necessidades da empresa. Tenho paixão por ensinar e realizar treinamentos, grande prazer em otimizar e organizar processos, participar de decisões estratégicas e elaborar relatórios consistentes. Também desenvolvi o conteúdo de diversidade em minha última empresa, pautado em instituições referências no assunto de maneira inclusiva e didática. Tenho conhecimento avançado em plataformas de atendimento (Zendesk/Freshdesk), em metodologias de jornada do cliente (CSAT, CRM, NPS etc), vasto conhecimento em pacote Office e ferramentas do Google, com comunicação assertiva, idioma inglês avançado, boa noção de lógica de programação, gamificação de processos, design thinking, além de resolução de problemas de alta complexidade mesmo sob pressão, sem contar o conhecimento avançado sobre hardware de computadores e design 3D que gostaria de praticar mais. Meu intuito é continuar no mercado de startups ou empresas inovadoras, que apoiem a diversidade e foquem na entrega. Como tenho duas doguinhas que contam muito comigo, estou optando inicialmente por vagas híbridas ou 100% remotas. Se souber de alguma vaga ou puder compartilhar esse post para me ajudar nessa realocação, vai ser de grande ajuda e vai ter minha eterna gratidão. Muito obrigado se você leu até aqui e um excelente dia! :)#layoff #realocação #startup #customersuccess #customerexperience #gamedesign #atendimento #supervisor #diversidade #vagas #design #designthinking #hardware #empresas

Impact of #Inflation on #Healthcare: 100K #Nurses and 117K #Doctors Leaving Adds Fuel to the Fire...Remainder of Video and Sources at AHealthcareZ YouTube Channel HERE: https://lnkd.in/gwknq7dJInflation so far has peaked at 9.1% in June of 2022.  Inflation has been caused by an inward shift in aggregate #supply from COVID lockdowns and an outward shift in aggregate #demand because of 1) direct government #payments ($900+B to 165M people) and 2) an expansion in the #MoneySupply by the Federal Reserve Bank (0% interest rates).   In response, the Federal Reserve System is raising #InterestRates to lower aggregate demand and slow or even shrink the economy--i.e. #recession.  Healthcare--and more specifically the #hospital sector--has seen high inflation because of a decrease in the supply of labor (100K nurses leaving, 117K doctors leaving) and an increase in demand for services (COVID and sicker patients who did not seek care during COVID).  Hospitals will pass on their rising costs to #employers.  Employers in turn will #layoff employees because of the recession and decrease the number of members on their plan.  These people will then sign up for #ACA plans, enroll in #Medicaid or go uninsured... all of these forms of coverage pay hospitals less than commercially insured plans.  As a result, hospitals will see decreased #revenue.  Hospitals will likely need to close facilities, layoff administrative staff and stop building projects.  Perhaps this #pruning of the hospital sector is a painful, but necessary process to allow for the rebirth of #PrimaryCare in America.

Hello Network,Please share.... If you are looking for this type of work, please reach out to Srinivas.Good Luck
-----------------------------
While disgustingly embarrassing to admit I'm putting aside my pride for my family and our child. This week, Monday, I was let go from my role in product management. Opening up about this still feels emotionally difficult - it's really tough. In the first 24 hours, self-doubt surged. ‘Not valuable. Not good enough.’ There is a stigma around being laid off/fired/discharged. Today, I want everyone to know that, while these thoughts and emotions are normal - we are not defined by being let go or fired. We are not the weakest link, nor were we ever the least important. We are valuable!Yes - I cried because my journey in product management has abruptly and only temporarily ended. There were people who believed in me from Day 1 and people who are heartbroken, too! I want to reach out to my connections here, please reach out and help spread my message out. I am open for work! I am interested in entry-level product management, product operations or product specialist, and technical product owner/manager roles. My superpower is a deep level of customer empathy, I’m intellectually curious and a visionary. My previous experiences include legal-tech, social impact/justice, and health-tech which includes working cross-functionally with a global team to launch a health-tech product in 10 weeks. I am extremely hard working, can pick up new skills very quickly, am empathetic, have a tech background and I am resilient...#layoff #techlayoffs #fired #resilience #productmanager #productmanagement #mentalhealth #wellbeing #OpenToWork

Salesforce latest to confirm #layoffs #Salesforce on Tuesday confirmed that it has laid off some staff, with CNBC reporting that "less than 1,000 people" have been let go. Up to 2,500 employees could eventually be affected by the job cuts, Protocol reports, adding that staff with "performance issues" would be specifically targeted. The software giant is seeking to slash costs amid a "new activist investor challenge and harsh economic conditions," Protocol notes. Salesforce employs more than 73,000 people and has grown its headcount by 36% over the past year, according to a recent filing.#layoff #jobs #business #linkedin https://lnkd.in/e75rBG_d

Winter is coming; and, when I say winter, I mean more layoffs - a lot more. Here's a quick guide on how to prevent yourself from turning into a white walker if you find yourself a victim of a reduction in workforce.Work as hard as possible to remember, maintain, and bring your best persona to as many networking and interviewing sessions as you can. It's easy to fall into a pit of self-doubt and desperation. Think back, consistently, to a time where you were at your best. You are still that person amidst a layoff. Surround yourself with people who know that that best persona is you in your innermost core. Connect with them often.Set a routine early. Stick to it. What times are you at your mental peak during the day? Set aside those slots for networking and interviewing. What times do you start mentally descending? Those time slots are for you to rejuvenate through “easier” wins: exercise, family/friend time, chores, applying to jobs, messaging people in your network and/or hiring managers - things that make you feel like you are getting something (even a small thing) accomplished.Own and bring your skills to a consultative or independent contractor stage. List your services capabilities on LinkedIn. Join freelance platforms like Upwork, Braintrust, and others. Contact prior internal peers and/or external partners who know that you’re a badass and offer your expertise on a consultative or deliverable-oriented basis. Even better: approach them with deliverables from the outset. Who knows: you might be able to garner enough work to alleviate some or all of the pains (financial or otherwise) of being laid off. BTW: you don’t have to wait until you are jobless to do this. Set aside some time to learn new skills or upskill your current capabilities. Coursera is dope, MasterClass is, too, and so is LinkedIn Learning (accessed through a premium LI subscription). I also know some great folks over at Reforge and have heard stellar things about their offerings. “But, Keller, all of that takes too long!” Yes, it’s a time investment. The sooner you start, the sooner you’re done.Cross some activities off of your bucket list. It doesn't have to be the huge things, either. You've got some unexpected time on your hands - maximize it. Go to that restaurant you've been wanting to try. Do that road trip. See that friend you've been meaning to reconnect with. Hear your favorite band/artist/musician live. Head to the game. See those paintings. This is a more qualitative post to keep your mental health game in prime shape for the job search and day-to-day life after a #layoff. I’ll have another post with more quantitative, specific resources in a bit.

Is ed-tech over?There's a lot of news lately about the ed-tech "bubble" popping and the layoffs in the industry. I refuse to believe this. We're just scratching the surface when it comes to the potential of ed-tech. In India, specifically, the potential for ed-tech unicorns in a variety of sectors and languages is vast. I see a possibility of 25-50 hidden unicorns, as each state may have its own unique needs and demands for educational technology.From School Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) systems to teacher training programs to specialized subject areas like physics or language learning, the possibilities are endless. And, ed-tech solutions aren't just limited to the domestic market - companies like PlanetSpark are already targeting international audiences.I am sure this industry will continue to provide exciting opportunities for growth and success in the coming years.What are your thoughts on the future of ed-tech?#edtech #ockypocky #education #english #unicorn #india #layoff

What an exhilarating ride I had at Pacaso over the last year and a half! Driven by an inspiring mission and fueled by some of the most talented, passionate, kind, and dedicated people I’ve ever worked with.  To my hiring team, Doug Anderson, Tash Bauer, Emily Hurst, Allicia Davis, Grace Pratt, Dan Pinciotti - thank you for trusting in me and including me in this exciting, rewarding ride. Together with our incredible crew, we made magic happen at a neck-breaking pace. We enabled exponential business growth and nearly unrealistic satisfaction among our Pacaso owners. We built a culture of trust and collaboration unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I am so grateful for this experience, and I will use it as a North Star for wherever my path takes me. To my invaluable Design team, Tash Bauer, Grant Szalay, Sabrina Ngai, Tonia Leung - you were a dream! Leading our team was the most fulfilling experience of my 23 year career. I was inspired as I watched you help each other grow and execute with brilliance and speed. Doug Anderson, you are a great leader and I learned so much from you. Your energy, charisma, humor, and an uncanny ability to cut to the root of any problem served as daily lessons and inspiration for my own developing leadership style. To Austin Allison and everyone else Pacaso, thank you for all the good times. I will miss you terribly and cheer you on from the sidelines. You got this!#layoff #layoffs #openforwork #openforopportunities #designleadership

~50 Days left in 2022Year started with WFH, Great resignation, followed with Moonlight, Now Recession is coming.  Per quarter one new challenge on our door steps effecting our mental health and working environmentSeem like we touched four generation of #workinglifestyle in a single year. My nation in a strongest believer in #moonlighters… All politician has business. Cricketer have government job. Teacher has tuition center. None of them have ever complained when employees were working for mutual fund, crypto currency but the moment they started using actual skill to earn extra money, lot of voice were overheard.Are companies are really worried about moonlighting / Great Recession, Let looking for CXOS / top management which have a half a dozen simultaneous job. -         COE in one company-         Director in another,-         Advisory in NGO,-         believe it's not free serviceNone of employee ever used their billable time with their core skills to earn money, it the leisure time which drive the dessert for them I think nobody care of moonlight if sun is shining bright, seem like sunlight is darkening so the moon light is outstanding Note: I haven’t been engaged in any such relationship or #moonlighting #greatresignation.

Com a compra do Twitter pelo empresário Elon Musk, alterações começaram a ocorrer no quadro de funcionários. Dentre elas, a demissão das equipes voltadas a acessibilidade e direitos humanos.O Twitter é uma rede que vinha implementando e melhorando recursos voltados à acessibilidade, como a possibilidade de inserir descrições das imagens que postamos.Com a saída dessas duas equipes, a incerteza sobre a continuidade das iniciativas de acessibilidade e inclusão faz com que surjam novamente discussões sobre redes sociais alternativas.Naquele espaço, pessoas com deficiência formaram grupos e estreitaram laços para a criação de um ambiente mais inclusivo e seguro.Ao supostamente ter a liberdade de expressão como a nova base da rede social e realizar essas demissões, a mensagem que o novo ambiente passa é clara: a voz de pessoas com deficiência não é bem vinda. Mais do que isso, é dispensável.O problema é que não há liberdade de expressão sem acessibilidade e inclusão. A troca de ideias nunca fica completa, os ecos nunca serão inclusivos e a expressão tem sua autonomia comprometida.Enquanto vozes forem silenciadas e presenças forem excluídas, não haverá equidade. Enquanto os direitos humanos forem considerados dispensáveis, não haverá espaço para o desenvolvimento de um ambiente seguro.O Twitter tinha (tem ainda?) como missão promover a conversa pública. A ideia era criar um lugar livre e seguro para pessoas conversarem.Em 4 de novembro acabou de dar um passo imenso na direção contrária do que um dia se propôs a fazer.A imagem contém texto alternativo.Hashtags#acessibilidade #layoff #inclusao #PessoasComDeficiência #a11yBrasil #autista #autismo #redessociais #DescriçãoDaImagem
