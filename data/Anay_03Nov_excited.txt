⭐️ Any recommendations of things to see & do in New York? Getting very excited about our trip in a couple of weeks. 🇺🇸 It’s been 20 plus years since we last visited so we’re a bit out of date. 😂Looking forward to seeing our lovely daughter who is studying in Brooklyn for a semester. ❤️And taking in some of the sights. 🍎Suggestions on things to do most welcome! 🙏 #newyork #excited

It’s with a heavy heart that I’ve after more than 3,5 eventful years have decided that it’s time to try something new. A massive thanks to all colleagues and stakeholders. I want to acknowledge what a fantastic workplace 3 Danmark has been both professionally and personally. It’s been inspiring to work with so many talented individuals in the Group. Leaving me with a humbling gratitude for the many learnings and growth opportunities within the Company. I wish everyone the best of luck. Although saddened by leaving 3 Danmark, I’m equally excited to embark on a new adventure.Very pleased to announce that I had my first day at Karnov Group Denmark and looking forward to be part of their growth journey - filling out the newly created position as Team Lead in Accounting. Really looking forward to the new opportunities and the next chapter of my career. #excited #humbled #motivated

You’ll find out soon!!I can wait to develop a whole lot of content finally. The feeling of being overwhelmed paired with procrastinating my packing was and is still doubling up on me. Apna time aagaya boss!Also, this might seem like such a petty and futile thing for some, however, to me, it is equivalent to gobbling up a Bahubali thali or something even more humongous than this. More in upcoming posts!__Let’s connect?____#content #movingout #opportunities #growth #excited #adulting#newbeginnings #monday

So fascinating to lead and execute rebranding and renaming process, only six months after joining the company 🎯 New brand identity will be released before Christmas 😍  Skarta and NYAB joined forces at the end of March to speed up the building of a clean future. Today more than 70 percent of Group revenue is generated in Sweden, where NYAB has achieved exceptionally profitable organic growth, as well as built a strong culture and a respected brand. Now we want to strengthen a shared culture between Finland and Sweden and to simplify our brand portfolio by taking the NYAB name in use. The name change is intended to be decided by the Extraordinary General Meeting on 22 November 2022.  Follow us on SkartaNYAB Plc#excited #brand #culture #change #strategy #NYAB #SkartaNYAB

I could tell my story of all that I went through to make it to this day. However, I am not special, my obstacles might have been more tedious than others, I may have endured more than others, however, I refuse to use my struggles to define me. Everyone has obstacles they must overcome in order to gain achievement. The story I want to tell is that God is able, hardwork pays off, determination paves the way, confidence in you is strength and your super power. My story is that I did well because I am here to tell you and show you that I did. I am celebrating. I am proud of me, I'm am excited for me, I am excited for what is to come. I thank God, my family for the motivation, and especially my siblings who made sure I was taken care of each step of the way. Big up me!!! #motivation #power #confidence #graduate #bachelorsdegree #Imadeit #Ididit #proud #excited

Just back from a mostly disconnected vacation today and checking my social media, email, Slack, internal social media, SMS and calls to my personal phone, it's been heartwarming to see thousands of combined messages from people around the latest promotion - I've spent 3-4 hours so far trying to personally respond to them 😅Historically, I've suppressed notifications of promotions to my network, but this one was special. Thank YOU for being here along the way and for all the ❤️, support and encouragement - going to continue to need it on the expanded role !#leadership #gratitute #excited

This is what I love about LI.One post leads and merges into another.I find that when you open up and show vulnerability which provides a gateway into new connections and existing network. Kicking the week off with a vulnerable post. Short timeline-Resilience Card 2006-April-Left the safety of the military 2006-May-started as a green hand offshore in Holland2006-2015-Successful career in O&G one I’m proud of2015-Redundant from O&G2016-Started new role-In 6 months I was dismissed, sacked. Not engaging with stakeholders effectively according to the company??2016-Took another role-pay cut of £50k…..Five Zero K from my O&G package.I could’ve easily said no-I knew I wanted to remain in H&S. The salary didn’t cover our outgoings, let alone have a lifestyle. 2018-Started a new role in Waste management, shortly after, Wallop suffered a TIA stroke-Viridor fully supported me and my family.2019-Headed back out to sea with the help of an acquaintance and good contact. 2Yr plan kicked in.2019-Moved from our lovely house to our flat-ReOrg2019-5 Year plan developed and progressing nicely2021-Moved away from O&G-In a role that I now absolutely love Let’s break that down.Redundant-That’s life, no control, one of life’s obstacles Dismissal-Well that was for sticking firmly by my personal values and beliefs. Reflecting back maybe I could’ve approached the situation more diplomatically than I did. Telling the Director of HR that their soft skill/power skills required some development wasn’t the best career choice. (Maybe an F bomb dropped in for good measure)🫣When your asked to change and miss out key findings from a site report, that to me is unacceptable & toxic. I’d be operating outside of the institutes CoC and my personal values. No chance-I’d do the same again.All to reduce capital expenditure and optimise profit margins. Those findings would effect the regional managers bonus incentive. The company were poisonous-I wasn’t going to be the next recruit.I didn’t have the skill set and experience in an onshore capacity that I do now. I do take full responsibility for that, I put our families reputation and belongings on a cliff edge. I wasn’t going to stand there and operate in the way they expected. Reflection-Redundancy was the BEST thing that happened to me and a tough grade bouldering wall to navigate.Life lesson. Your life can be spun inside out if you sit back and focus on the negative stuff You have to persue the dream and ensure your process and performance goals are aligned with that dream.Supportive network is something I think is massively underestimated. I now see the value and importance of it.Being made redundant was a pivotal time/moment and such an important lesson life thrown our way. I am grateful for those lessons and now the route and roadmap points towards 2024. #excited#vulnerability #lifelongdream

After being selected to attend the National Society of Minorities in Hospitality (NSMH) National Conference 2022 in Miami, Florida, I could not contain my excitement. I didn't know what to expect or what opportunities I should be pursuing. Still, I was determined to enter the space as my full self with an open mind and an open heart. I browsed the career fair for what felt like an eternity before stopping at a table where I was engaged in the most thought-provoking conversation I had the entire time I was at the event. I knew walking away from that table that this could be a place for me to excel and ultimately, somewhere I could be happy.Fast forward to now, I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted an internship offer with General Mills for the Summer 2023 term. This couldn't have been possible without the help and support of the recruitment team (Nancy Qiu, Courtney Glotzbach, Marissa Moksnes, Lindsay Jukua), my family, friends, and God above all. Super excited for what's to come! 😆 #GeneralMillsinternlife #iworkforGenMills #acceptedoffer #excited

It’s been a hectic year. That feels like an understatement to be honest 😂 But in many respects - personally, professionally and for many of our colleagues and clients - it genuinely has. Having relocated our young family down to #christchurch just in time for my wife to have our 3rd (and last!) son, the past few months have definitely seen above-average levels of hectic though. PwC New Zealand - after being so supportive of the move and my ability to retain a leadership role in the CT team - has again generously provided me the opportunity to spend this special few months at home. Paternity leave has been incredible for several reasons - watching Kit, our newest member, settle into the world; seeing Liam (4) and Freddie (2) welcome a new brother with gentleness and love; and seeing my amazing wife Jess Lawson strive (and power) through a Psychology Masters thesis (while breast feeding, parenting and generally holding the rest of the house together!). Similar to 2020, I again find myself #motivated and #excited  as I get set to return to work next week. The macroeconomic outlook for 2023 is fragile (at best), financial market volatility is BACK, debt markets are starting to soften and we are continuing to make exciting investments in our people and tools to bring clients sustained value and insights. Thanks again to a remarkable effort from the Treasury and Debt Advisory team for doing my mahi and see you all next week 👍#team #pwc #parenting Alex Wondergem Brett Johanson FCA Mike Shirley Natasha Donaldson Rajeev Verma Cameron Scott Keegan Robbins Grace Lewis stephanie B.

A budding artist I am certainly not, but this gets the message across to whom it concerns. This Chris Aged 6 sketch really could be the next step for Justine Smalley and I and Smalley Hot Tub Services.We both know alot is going on in the hot tub industry, with several retailers and even manufacturers now shutting their doors. However, we feel as primarily offering engineering services, we fall into a different category. Retail, yes it offers far larger returns initially, but then take into account stock holdings, showroom operating costs, energy being the big one. Justine has been updating our Xero accounts ready to submit the next quarterly VAT return. As it stands, since taking payment systems such as SumUp on, we have astonishingly seen a 1000% increase In revenue since this time last year. OK, we were operating out of our garden at the time, we now have larger over heads, but when we saw that figure it's truly astounding.But I digress, back to this drawing. Pending its review and associated workings, we really could leapfrog onto the stage. Something I know quite a few retailers this year haven't managed!#giddy #excited #anxious #smallbusiness #veteranowned #familybusiness #prestigeawards #engineering #project #tomorrow

Happy Monday's 😁 I posted a couple of weeks ago I was like a big kid with a new toy, well this morning that feeling came back. Lovely coming into London Wall to find our new Armed Forces client brochure has arrived. Looks fantastic and can't wait to see the reaction tomorrow night at a special event! It's great to see the work we are doing to support those in that are serving, have served and their families continue to grow and a lot more to come. So pleased as part of the brochure we could get in the work we are doing with four amazing Armed Forces charities as well. Love the fact we are doing all this because "It's the right thing to do" Big THANK YOU! to my boss Leigh Dunkley DipPFS for your hard work pulling this together and having ready in time. #excited #wechangelives #armedforcescommunity #armedforcescovenant

🧡 BIG smile this morning as I kicked off my first official day as Spare Key's Executive Director. 🧡SO much hard work and dedication has gone into the last three years at this amazing nonprofit, and I can proudly say that I can't wait for this next chapter!None of what we do EVERY SINGLE DAY for families facing a medical crisis is possible without SO many incredible individuals. From our dedicated staff of Alexia Sebesta, Angela Frazier, and Talia Simonett to our knowledgeable Board of Directors to partners, volunteers, and sponsors. I am so incredibly honored to be working with every single one of you to ensure Spare Key continues to help more families facing unimaginable medical crises "Be Seen. Be Heard. Be Found." by donors across the nation!✅ First lesson learned of the day? Post early before the day starts! I took this photo before an 8am meeting and had a plan of what I wanted to say, but my day quickly filled with amazing conversations with Board Members and Spare Key partners. Now it's 2pm and I'm finally getting around to making a post! Yet, I wouldn't have it any other way!#nonprofit #excited #dogood #executivedirector #team

Honoured and Delighted to receive my certificate for Hallam award Bronze through my Masters journey at Sheffield Hallam University. 😇Looking forward to the next challenge of achieving the Silver and Gold awards too!To the great step in getting ready for the future..✨Thank you Sheffield Hallam University and Sheffield Hallam University Careers & Employability Service!Thanks Praise Ishola, Student Union President for the certificate!Thanks Lennie Young for all the support!——————What is Hallam Award?The Hallam Award is for all students, and will help you showcase your achievements and gain recognition for the extra things you do outside of your course. The award helps us to make the most of your time here at Hallam by giving you the chance to reflect on your activities and develop yourself. The Hallam Award gives you a way to collect all these experiences and make sense of them. It makes you more aware of how you’re developing, more aware of how you want to grow, and how to go about it. Most importantly, it helps you to get into the habit of managing your own development. Whatever you do while you're here, the Hallam Award will help you showcase your achievements. Seek out new experiences. Say yes to things, as you never know where they’ll lead. Most of all, have fun!The Hallam Award has three levels: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. At each level, you choose two new Hallam graduate attributes to develop through your activities. You will have 12 attributes to choose from; these have been developed in conjunction with top employers and industry professionals. ❇️ BRONZE AWARDThe Bronze Award is about exploring the range of extra-curricular activities that uni has to offer. Bronze level activities are about trying new things, and could include one-off volunteering, casual part-time work (as a Student Ambassador, for example), or attending a session with an Employability or Enterprise Advisor. Choose 2 graduate attributes to develop, and get involved in activities!❇️ SILVER AWARDThe Silver award is about stretching yourself a bit further, developing new skills and showing a greater commitment to your activities. Choose 2 more graduate attributes to develop, and get involved in activities! Do something new, or show more commitment to an activity you're already doing.❇️ GOLD AWARDThe Gold Award is about challenging yourself to achieve even more. This could include participating in complex or time consuming activities, demonstrating even greater commitment or developing in a leadership role. Choose 2 more graduate attributes to develop and get involved in activities!For all SHU students who are interested for this can follow below link.🌐 Hallam Award Link : https://lnkd.in/e6aP6xvD 🌐 Link: Graduate attributes list- https://lnkd.in/eVp58CV5 🌐 Link: Extra-curricular activities list - https://lnkd.in/eKzAUQQx----#HallamAwards #Bronze #SheffieldHallamUniversity #Masters #GlobalMBA #excited

Today markes the start of my final two weeks at Gather & Gather. It’s been an amazing, tough, emotion spiralling year back. So many ups and downs, both personally and professionally. I’ve worked with some amazing team members and made friends with some incredible and talented colleagues. I’ve worked alongside some wonderful clients that have allowed me to be the best manager & colleague I could be. Unfortunately this year, I’ve also worked with people that I never want to cross paths with, ever again!!! That aside, as I leave, I will be taking some amazing memories with me, and sadness that I’m leaving some incredible people behind. I’m also so excited to be starting my next chapter in a couple of weeks. I’m looking forward to be working for an amazing company where I can make a difference, and where people make places. More to come.  #team #people #newbeginnings #memories #peoplemakethedifference #peoplemakeplaces #nextchapter #excited

How do you feel about your final day in a roll? Personally, I think the way you feel on your final day says a lot about both the job you were doing and the people you worked with.Today is my last day in my current role, the position didn't work out the way I had hoped or expected and I have spent the last few months doing something completely different to my normal work. It has been interesting but not what I specialise in.In terms of the role, will I miss it? Honest answer is ...... No. It wasn't using me to my fullest extent.Will I miss the people I worked with, definitely. A very interesting and varied crowd of people.Am I looking forward to my new role, most definitely. It is a role I have been after for a number of years and I really believe I am going to love it.As for the people at my new job, only time will tell but I have met the Partners and they both seem really nice.#excited #newjob

I am #excited to announce that I will be attending the international educational program "Employability and Talent Management in the Digital Era - Best Practices | Navigating the Workstyles of the Digital Era: Fostering Creative Ecosystems for a Sustainable World of Work" organised from International Human Resource Management - IHRM SCHOOL 2022 (from West University of Timisoara, Romania) and will be held online between 28 Nov - 2 Dec with 10 universities from different countries (USA, UK, Switzerland, #Greece , Malaysia, Hungary, Serbia etc).I want to say a big thank you to my professor who suggested that I should apply to this program, Mr Achilleas Anagnostopoulos and my Business Administration Dpt - University of Thessaly for taking part and giving us this opportunity.SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE IHRM SCHOOL 2022: The workstyles of the digital era contain new flexible systems of engagement and hiring; cultures of more sustainable, more supportive, more creative, but also more affordable work that not only gives employers and employees a wider platform of recruitment options, but it also suggests an answer to the burgeoning question of what work might mean to individuals in future.

I have to admit that still after 10 months at adesso Nordics I'm sometimes amazed what all we at adesso do. This time it was research rocket software in space! 🚀"adesso SE provided the entire software infrastructure for the “Exp.007/Blofeld” experiment during the MAPHEUS-12 mission in Kiruna, Sweden. The protection of sensor data in spacecraft and in “life support systems” (ecosystems) in space is playing an ever greater role in space research. IT security and data encryption – another area in which adesso specialises – is a crucial factor here." I'm so happy to be part of this journey to grow our team in Nordics and provide also our colleagues expertise around Europe to our customers in Finland. #space #growth #excited #data #security

I am excited to be the new team member of Green Phenix and to work on combating the plastic problem.Annually, 11 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans.To make this number easier to digest: 11 Olympic swimming pools can be filled with plastic entering the ocean every hour.If current trends continue, it is expected that the oceans will contain more plastic than fish by the year 2050.We should not be at peace with this reality and do our utmost best to reduce, reuse and recycle our plastics!Green Phenix is a social enterprise that fosters a circular and inclusive economy in Curaçao. We organize shoreline clean-ups, recycle different types of plastic into new products, raise awareness about the plastic challenge, and conduct research on plastic pollution. In the recycling process, people with a distance from the labor market have the chance to (re)discover their talents and improve their quality of life.We are eager to connect, so don’t hesitate to shoot a message if you are interested or want to join our efforts!#KòrsouLimpi #PlasticPollution #Recycling #CircularEconomy #GreenPhenix #CleanOceans #Excited #NewJob

~Ciao~ 👋A short stay but it was nothing less than a great learning curve,Last week officially marks my last day at Preqin . I would like to express my thanks for all the support the business has given me during this time. Being part of the company's success and seeing the company grow into a key market leader  is something I feel very proud to have been a part of.On another note, I am super excited for the new beginning and challenges.😊#excited #greatful #work #jobchange #newbeginning

Great points to take to heart for transitioning and vets already out. I keep joking that I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. The great news, is that I can focus on finding my passion, or calling and try out new things!I’ll admit, it is overwhelming to scan all the careers, jobs, companies vying for attention and talent. I’m used to someone sending me an email with orders to my next assignment. Don’t be afraid to learn new things, connect/network with old friends and colleagues. Introduce yourself to new people and new possibilities.  Finally, and I’m speaking to myself as much as to anyone else. Take your own advice and be your best advocate. Grow!

What does it mean to perform under pressure in the work that we do?Well, what I find, cool is the interpretation of the stimuli and what happens when you're nervous, right? Your heart rate starts to go up, you know, you sort of get a little tan, you get a little sweaty, right? You have expectations of what's coming and we interpreted that as I'm nervous. Now, what the interpretation of excited, your heart rate starts to go. You're anticipating. What's coming? Get a little tense. It's all the same thing. It's the same stimuli except for these Olympics. Adult athletes have learned to interpret the stimuli that the rest of us would say, as nervous as excited, they all said the same thing. No, I'm not nervous, I'm excited!And so I've actually practiced it, just tell myself when I start to get nervous that this is excitement now and somebody says, how do you feel I'm like really excited actually it came from just sort of telling myself, no no this is excitement and it becomes a little bit automatic later on and it's really kind of effect of it makes you want to rush for this rather than pull back. And yet it's the same.#excited #nervous #underpressure #metaoak # #work #personallife

Learning is amazing.Today, I learned how to sell an exterior door install.Why is this important for someone in Saas? Because I learned how to speak another customer’s language and I was able to apply my current skill set to the conversation and improve it.I am so excited to take knowledge from any sales conversation I can be a part of and add it to my skill set and apply what I already know.I’m also so grateful for Lowe's Companies, Inc. for always having my back and providing for my family during my time of transition.YES! I’m back at Lowe’s part-time and I am so proud of that.I am also excited that I’ll soon be able to give y’all the coolest news ever regarding my future in tech sales.Waiting is challenging. But when you fill it with learning, it’s worth it.What was something you learned today?#perseverance #persistence #alwayslearning #growthmindset #excited #dreamsdocometrue

We spend months or years #preparing for many significant #life_events. The first for many of us was the build-up to going to ‘big school’. Our three-, four- and five-year-old selves grew increasingly #excited, right up until the day school started and then there was an overwhelming flow of #emotions that may have been more negative than positive. When you stand in the playground of first-graders on the first day of school, you’re bound to see plenty of tears.#BetterConversations #BetterExpectations #LifeAfterWork #Letschat

The Women’s Organization of MBAs at UT had such a great day Thursday! We kicked it off with a Halloween Photobooth Fundraiser and finished the day with a cute Halloween get-together. We networked, painted teacups, and went all in on the Alice in Wonderland theme. I want to thank everyone who donated to our organization. I want to thank every member who volunteered. I want to thank everyone who attended last night. We are all so busy, and it was great to take the time to be. It has been a great semester getting to know everyone and celebrating women in business.Looking forward to our next event already! 👻🧡#WOMBA #womeninbusiness #Halloween #Fundraiser #SupportWomen #Excited

✨COVER REVEAL for “The Art of Calm—Spiritual Exercises for the Anxious Soul”✨“As anxiety grows as a mental health concern—a practical guide for using art to manage stress.”“Honest stories of the author's descent into fear and anxiety, a diagnosis of mental illness, and how he found his way back to a place of stability and health inform this inspiring guidebook for those struggling with anxiety, fear, and panic. Told with vulnerability and compassion, the author's story and the practices he provides will inspire and encourage readers who face a diagnosis of anxiety and depression. Reflection questions, journaling prompts, and practices will help readers lead a more grounded and centered life. Hutchison found photography as a daily practice during his recovery helped him to slow down, see the world through from new perspectives, get out in nature, and live more contemplatively. The exercises and reflections included at the end of each chapter encourage readers to try out a variety of creative practices to find their way to a more centered and peaceful life. Practices range from photography, art, music, and meditation to cooking and hiking and help the reader reset their outlook, and find themselves again amidst inner and outer turmoil. Hutchison's guiding voice will show readers they are not alone.”NOW AVAILABLE FOR PREORDER!Release Date April 18, 2023https://a.co/d/6tutiMe#coverreveal #newbook #artofcalm #rogerhutchison #anxiety #depression #fear #transformation #guide #art #music #meditation #diagnosis #photography #questions #journaling #panic #compassion #vulnerability #vulnerabilityisstrength #excited #overthemoon #challenge #preorder #honest #truth #learningtosee #listenwithyourheart

From the pit of my stomach, I know that I wanted to achieve more in my professional career. I felt this way, emotionally, psychically and spiritually to the point, I could no longer it. I accepted this, but I had no idea how to go about it. Until I made a daunting post on LinkedIn asking for help. This post exactly 6 months have changed my life for the betterment. Since that post, I have obtained multiple certifications towards my career interests, had a few interview and  multiple rejections. To this day, I have calculated that I to applied 6734 jobs and I don’t feel hopeless. I have a few amazing opportunities coming up, and I believe one of those is my fresh start. To my fellow job seekers don’t give up or give in. Keep rowing the boat on your job search. Life is a about growth and progression. If anyone reading this post feels that they need a change or growth in their career or private life. My advice is to invest in yourself. Do it!#projectmanagement #projectmanager #remote #Grit #perserverance #opportunities #recruiters #motivation #nevergiveup #positivemindset #excited Looking in, looking out, looking even better

Understand the difference between being a prospecting agent and marketing-reliant agent. Will be great to have both figure out within your business in order to experience massive groth, but if you need a wake up call I’m here to tell you if you’re solo a marketing reliant agent you’ll run thorough your resources before creating a stable income. So start with prospecting first and ad marketing after, not the other way around. #qotd #growinguplearning #blessed #thetopagentacademy #thoughts #purpose #dreams #excited #realestategoals #realestatecoaching #financialfreedom #torontorealestate #torontorealestateagent #canadarealestate #Quotes

#SignsOfBurnout #WhyMindy? ARM👇🏻💭 Do you remember your first day at work, how #excited you were for a new start and #opportunities, and that eagerness to do well?  ✔️ It is normal that this #enthusiasm may decrease over time, but it should never disappear and turn into #apathy or #indifference.  😏 No longer caring about the #quality of your work, how your #colleagues think of you, or whether or not tasks are completed on time, are all possible signs of #apathy.  There is simply NO PASSION, lack of emotions…  In  Mindy we explain that feelings, help to prevent them, as they are symptoms of #burnout.  🤔 And how to prevent such apathy? Answers you will find in Mindy 😉 services.💭 Հիշո՞ւմ եք Ձեր առաջին աշխատանքային օրը, որքան ոգևորված էիք նոր սկզբի և հնարավորությունների համար և ինչ եռանդով էիք լցված` աշխատանքը հնարավորինս լավ անելու: ✔️ Նորմալ է, որ ժամանակի ընթացքում այդ #էնտուզիազմը կարող է նվազել, սակայն այն երբեք չպետք է անհետանա և վերածվի #ապատիայի՝ #անտարբերության։  😏 Անտարբերության հետևանքով Դուք այլևս չեք մտածում կատարված աշխատանքի #որակի մասին, ինչ են մտածում #գործընկերները Ձեր մասին կամ արդյոք աշխատանքը ժամանակին է արվել, թե` ոչ։ Պարզապես ՀԱՎԵՍ ՉԿԱ…Բայց  Mindy-ի մասնագետներն այդ իրավիճակում ասում են ավելին` կա Հուզական այրում (#burnout)։  🤔 Իսկ ինչպե՞ս կանխել ապատիան։ Պատասխանները` Mindy 😉 ծառայություններում են  #MindyServices #mindy #burnoutprevention #burnoutsigns #burnoutovercoming

Since past few weeks I have been asking myself this question. What’s next after reaching the #goal? 6 years ago, while I was making big life changing plans and setting goals, I was all #excited , #motivated  and filled with lots of #positivevibes . Every small #milestone  I was achieving was pushing me further to run towards my big goal. However, during this process, one thing I never realised that what next after reaching this? Over the past 5 years I have not only checked all my #wishlist , in fact I exceeded my list, also become a better version of myself, the "me" reached the goal is certainly different than the "me" set it. I am very #grateful and #thankful for all who supported during this massive journey. Now comes the question, What’s next? Few days ago, over the conversation, a good friend of mine told me that, hey you worked pretty hard to get to where you are today so why don’t you appreciate your hard work and enjoy the victory for a while. Do you agree on pausing for a while and just enjoy the success before setting another goal?.#energy #grateful #work #goalsetting #reachinggoals #selfdevelopment #selfdiscipline #journey #success #successmindset #thankfulness

Your mortgage interest rate will have a major impact on the total price you pay for your home, so it's important to shop around for the right mortgage lender. Different lenders will have different offers on loan terms, interest rates and fees.#Inspiration #Excited #passion #successquotes #hustle #entrepreneur #inspire #goals #change #rich #happy #now #custom #new #old #rare #fast #billionaire #billion #million #millionaire #luxury

The sale of a small business is supposed to be confidential. In reality, most people will be aware that something is going on, but this doesn't mean that you can start talking about it. Build a small team that will help consult you on the process that will keep all communications internal.#Inspiration #Excited #passion #successquotes #hustle #entrepreneur #inspire #goals #change #rich #happy #now #custom #new #old #rare #fast #billionaire #billion #million #millionaire #luxury

"With the same #habits, we'll end up with the same #results. But, with better habits, anything is #possible"- James Clear, Atomic HabitsThis is one of my #favorite lines in this book. It emphasizes that we are capable of anything possible. But just like others, I also have limiting beliefs.I make excuses instead of taking action.I craved results.I have high expectations of myself.If I don't get the results that I expect, I easily get frustrated.Then...I'll try something else.Get hype up, get excited.If faced with difficulties, I easily get stressed and give up.And the cycle goes on.So for now, I'll make goals that I have control of.❌Instead "This month, I'll get one client"✅It would be "This month, I'll connect to 100 prospects, apply to15 Job applications, Daily Value posting, 5 daily reach-out, and 15 mins cheerleading"The first goal excites meThe second goal motivates me.I'll go for the second one because I have control over it. Then, as a result, I might get the first one also. Who knows? No one. So I'll go out and take action.#possibilities #opportunities #mindset #habits #goals #motivation #excited #action #prospect #jamesclear #atomichabits #book #bestbooks #results #expectations #dreams

When I moved to London in 2020, I began working as a maternity nurse and I realized how lonely and lost most of the mothers were when it came to breastfeeding, without any family member around to help.This led to the birth of ‘Carla Corral Lactation Consultant • IBCLC’. I can’t be more in love about my business logo. Many thanks to @albadearmengol to make this lovely logo🙏🏻😍And you may be thinking, how is this related to becoming an IBCLC? So, if you want to know the answer, tune in to my next post🙊😬#lactationconsultant #ibclc #IBCLC #nicunurse #maternitynurse #lactationsupport #newborn #nursing #breastfeeding #empower #confidence #breastfeedinglife #newbusiness #excited #breastfeedingsupport #consultants #breastmilk #newbusiness #newlogo #breastfeedinghelp #infantfeeding #newparents
