But here I am! #grateful

The last few months have been absolutely bonkers. All in a very positive way, with the launch of a new business, and the continued growth of Xactly, but transition can be so hard & take lots of work. The balance needed can be hard to find, but make sure you do, because you deserve it, and also because it will actually help with your growth. Be fueled by your work, but be fueled by that balance too. Because in the end, that’s truly what it’s about.My Saturday morning reflection while I do yoga on the deck in November, have a delicious latte & appreciate my absolutely stunning view. What else could I ever ask for.#balance #blessed #grateful #entrepreneurship #agencylife

COY17 Egypt has been a great experience despite challenges and I am #grateful for the opportunity that YOUNGO has provided for young people to attend this conference.The networking was on point and it was a real pleasure to meet climate advocates from around the world who were not only passionate about making a difference but also highly qualified and engaged in critical climate work in their respective countries and professional roles.While we are hopeful that #cop27 will address some very important and persistent issues in multilateral climate dialogue including loss and damage, carbon markets and climate finance, it may well be another failure.In the end, having a fellowship of climate worriers, optimists, dreamers and activists to bond with was a unique and special experience, and for that, I am #thankful. We will continue to dream of an #Ecotopia and work towards making the world a better place for all.Sana Salhi, PhD. Aishath Rayahyn W Judy Njenga Melissa Tomassini

Being posted to a place I’ve never been in my life for NYSC, I thought to myself wow NYSC really threw me out of my comfort zone because why post me so far? What happened posting me to Lagos? I don’t know anybody there all my friends and family are in Lagos.I heard stories about NYSC the good, bad and ugly. I just wanted mine to be okay nothing too serious. It’s just one year I’ll be fine.My service year was amazing guys 😁. I don’t know how God did it but he did it. NYSC turned out to be a very beautiful experience for me.I had the opportunity to serve, meet real life angels and learn. I worked with amazing organizations and was able to volunteer multiple times.The highlight of my service year was teaching. I never thought I’d be a teacher in my lifetime. Impacting the younger generation was fulfilling. I miss telling people ‘my kids are the best’.One thing NYSC taught me is LIFE BEGINS AT THE END OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

I recently completed a year with the Project Monitoring Group (PMG) in #investindia. I am sure not many of us have heard about this fantastic group of dedicated professionals who have been working day-in and day-out, trying to resolve issues faced by mega #infrastructure projects in India.In most of our lives, our interaction with #infrastructureprojects is limited to generally two instances – one when any road, railway, airport (etc) project is announced and secondly when we start using the same once that project is commissioned. However, it has been a fascinating journey of living with these massive infrastructure projects as soon as they hit the ground and continuing with their lifecycles, parallelly trying to resolve any issues they face. Not only has it widened my perspective around #policy formulation but has also been a case study in challenges around implementation, communication and coordination. I am #grateful to have received the support of many stakeholders, both internal and external, who have helped me navigate the roundabouts in this journey. Though it wouldn’t be possible to individually thank them however they have my utmost respect and gratitude. But would definitely like to thank a few key individuals starting from my CEO Deepak Bagla and my senior colleague Rahul Agarwal, CFA, FRM for giving me this wonderful opportunity. Would also like to express my gratitude to Sh Amrit Lal Meena for his leadership, faith and continuous support in driving our mission of trying to get these critical projects commissioned as per their timelines.And most of all, special thanks to my present and former colleagues for building the foundation of PMG and driving it with all zeal without ever expressing the hardships that they face. Thank you Vishal Kumar Arihant Kumar Tushara Ravindranath Sanjana Kain Yashita Jhurani Arushi Gupta Aanchal Singh Shreya Chaudhary Rohit Dua Jyotika Singh Diksha Bhanot Prabhat Singh Sonali Chakravorty Vishal Jewrajka Priyanshi Arora It has been a momentous year for us, wherein we have been able to resolve more than 1100 issues in the first half of this FY. Looking forward to continuing this momentum in the months to come. For knowing more about PMG, do visit https://pmg.dpiit.gov.in/. Always open to discussing newer ideas for improving our systems and contributing more to the nation. Sharing a few glimpses of my journey.....

The Charity Hub & Industria Innovations are so grateful that our work together allowed us to donate $4000.00 to Sleeping Children Around the World, a cause we admire and that we fully support. It was a great privilege for us to make the donation in honor of the memory of Dave Dryden, past Chairman of the Board, who we knew as being altruistic, kind and a great human. Sieg Will, Dave’s son-in-law, accepted the cheque on behalf of his family and SCAW. It was a truly beautiful, heartfelt, and touching experience to share all together. #grateful #charity @thecharityhub @sleepingchildrenaroundtheworld #kindnessmatters #workingtogether @industriainnovations

When I migrated in the US a decade ago, I daydream about one day enrolling in UC Berkeley Extension. "Maybe it won't happen, maybe it's too big a goal for an immigrant who is starting over", I told myself. But there's nothing wrong about dreaming, right?So please understand that seeing myself featured on their Project Management website 10 years later makes me feel multiple layers of happiness. And yes, I'm saving this screenshot as a reminder that it's okay to dream, it's okay to set goals, even if you think they're bigger than what you are ever capable of. Thank you, UC Berkeley Extension for the knowledge. Though this is slightly tangential, I'll just say, I will always be proud to be with San Francisco Public Works, and will always be grateful to be working alongside brilliant, dedicated and tireless colleagues.

After my graduation in December, I will be working as an Operations Systems Engineer on the Mars rovers. I am so excited to come back to JPL for the start of my career. I have dreamed of working for NASA since I was a child, and I never thought my very first full-time job after college would be fulfilling that dream.

I am profoundly grateful to those around me who have supported me and to whom I owe my success.

When I attended the soft launch of the corporate challenge in March, unofficially (as I wasn’t yet in post ) I listened to an inspirational speech by our trustee Mike Steel.  At the end he threw out he’d love to see £200,000 raised!!! If you’ve met Mike you’ll know he’s larger than life.  There were gasps around the room .  I remember thinking WOW! There was absolutely no reason for concern as our Challengers this year … over 60 of them grabbed this challenge with both hands and ran with it.  I know I’ve said this before but it was an absolute pleasure and privilege to watch them work tirelessly for 4 months engaging their staff and supporters and each other , all for us.  Revealing that total at our awards night on Thursday was one of the highlights of my career .  So proud of all of them .  Thank you so much challengers you should all be really proud of what you’ve achieved and the massive contribution you have made to us as a hospice .  We are so grateful and we truly hope you’ll join us again in 2023 as we so have to do it all again !!!! I’m just not allowing Mike Steel to speak at the soft launch 😉 #thankyou #grateful #pendlesidehospice #pendlesidecorp #corporatechallenge #amazingsupport

As I wake up at home this morning, exhausted and exhilarated, I want to take a moment to simply say thank you! To the women in my learning group (no tags here to keep house rules), Thank you for sharing your stories, your struggles, your frustration and your tears. You are all awesome women.To the women from my company who joined me on this journey, thank you! Thank you being open the the journey! This was definitely not your typical ‘how to lead/succeed’. You know who you are - no tagging needed. Let’s make it work for us. Thank you to my leadership team who nominated me for the experience, who put the bet down on the table for me when I was not in the room, who’s faith in me will not be forgotten. Anthony Verriello, Billy Runyan  and Greg Gates. You read that right ladies - they advocated for me. Lesson to be learned from that invest and be intentional about male advocacy esp. if there are not a lot of women in the room when it’s decision time.A special thanks to Amy Evins for listening to my ideas and helping me channel my energy and providing the extra ‘ I got you’s’ ‘You got this’ moments. Lastly, to my fiancé, thank you for telling me to get on that plane, he would manage my ‘home’ work while I was away. He gets it ladies - I can’t do it all and be everything to everyone all the time. He wanted me to take time to invest in me. Thanks Babe. PS: if you don’t have this where you work, DM me and I’ll be more than happy to talk to you about where I work and how we work. #thankful #grateful #learning

It always leave me hopeful and eager to continue the work that I do.If you are from Europe and looking for a coach, please search Sara Heung.  Highly recommending her.  #coaching #coachmheng #grateful

Trauma treatment, here I come. Another session....and I can still feel my body resist and fight. Yet, I have found great relief in this release and as much as my body fights to let go of the past (If I remember and hold onto the memories of the past, I will be safe and can prevent further harm is the story it tells me), my heart guides me back again. TRE https://lnkd.in/gbywfVHK saved my life this past year. I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and even had a plan. Remembering horrific sexual abuse resulted in a strong desire to self destruct. However, I was lucky enough to meet and find a trauma therapist who provides me with safe space and a technique that has permitted me to release what has been present in my body since I was 13. Joy finally feels possible again. There have been many modalities that have helped me heal over the years but none that could access what I could not recall. I am so grateful and I will persevere and never give up. 💛 Thanks for reading.💛 Deep gratitude to you, Dr. David Berceli #trauma #grateful

Hi Everyone!I am so pleased to announce that I will be graduating with a commendation from my LLM LPC this year December University of Hertfordshire. This honestly feels like a dream! There were moments when I honestly couldn't even see myself walking across the stage. There was so much going on in my personal life that really broke me and left me shattered. But I thank God for the support of my loved ones, lecturers and mentors who kept reminding me that I could do it. The ones that spoke life into me in moments I felt lifeless. Julie Manson Olivia Grant Francine Allgood Brieanna McDonald Laura Capell-Abra Bejay Mulenga Tom Lyas Gavin Lock Bridget Tatham Makhala K. Grace Ononiwu CBE Deborah Frimpong Sofia Cardoso Delmar Leslie Courtney Daniella Boateng appreciate you more than you know! To all my undergraduates trust me when I say I know the journey is long and tiring. But I stand as a testament that with every hurdle will come success even when that path is not clear. The LLM LPC is definitely one of the hardest things I've had to overcome but I made it! I know you can too! Even in the times you want to breakdown or feel frustrated because life doesn't seem to stop, keep going. Keeping holding your head up! You've made it too far to give up now. Someone else is counting on you to keep going but the most important person is you. You owe yourself too much not to give it your all. I honestly, couldn't be more grateful to God for this moment. I couldn't see the finish line but I am now crossing it!Here's to all the future holds!! #success #future #grateful #university #graduation #LLMLPC #commendation

Be gratefulFor the things you have.Life is tough if you do not spend some time being grateful.It's simple to do and costs nothing.Yesterday I took the day out to visit Harewood House. I live Four miles away and don't go as much as I should.A bright, warm and colourful day I managed to capture the power of the sun over the land and trees.As with most things, timing is everything, and its the capturing of the moment that makes this picture so stunning for me.The space is biblical, the colours are a plenty and the trees are like characters on the landscape.I am working today, hence my outing yesterday, and will be busy covering a press story this afternoon. Whatever curved ball is thrown at me today I am ready for it because yesterday recharged and rewired my mind to focus on the next day.#gratitude #grateful #brandphotography #branddevelopment

"My second job being an undergraduate." As they say; "Do or do not. There's no try."I believed in this and made sure I make my way out. It has always helped me. At the end of last year, I was frazzled on where and how I'll get to do my official internship. Here I am with this year ending and having my second job being an undergraduate along with a year of an amazing working experience with accelerated learning. I'm grateful for how God has changed things and given me the best. Truly, there's no secret to achievement. It requires hassle and hardwork, which you have to do.I really want to thank Shafaq Sahito . and Midhat Zehra for an amazing welcome. Each day of mine has become productive and I'm excited for the time ahead. Hopefully all goes well, Inshallah. #job #experience #grateful #humanresources #humnetwork #humtv #undergraduate #hr #hrcareers # #learning #experience #exposure #jobs #gratefuleveryday

It is so strange how we only share the best of our lives. You may see me smiling in all the pictures but what you can not see is how many nights I have spent feeling numb.Life is not always glittering. And Social media becomes so deceiving that no matter how good we actually are, we still end up feeling bad and sad about our lives. We nearly forget to be grateful for all we have, and all we are left with is sadness and a lack of fulfillment in our lives.Ps: it is okay to have one of those days when all you want is coffee and a blanket and your baby to snuggle and be able to feel what you really feel on that very day. #socialmedia #grateful

#CCSHRM crushed it yesterday! It felt special & rewarding inviting two of Carroll County SHRM's founding volunteer leaders back for opening and closing keynotes on our 10th Annual Conference! Totally nailed it! Christine V. Walters, JD, MAS, SHRM-SCP, SPHR  "Ethics, Antitrust & Whistleblowing" Julie Develin, SHRM-SCP, GTML "Invisible Ink: The Psychological Contract & the Employee Experience".I didn't grow up dreaming of being an HR professional, even in college I struggled to figure out what I would do when I grew up. After working an office job only a couple years following college and being laid off unexpectedly, I feel like HR picked me. A manager for a locally-family-owned company took a chance on me (after two offers were turned down by more qualified candidates), and I still think about how lucky for me! Almost immediately after starting as an HR/payroll Admin in 2008, I felt like HR/payroll could be my thing. Then shortly into my new found career, meeting my CC SHRM friends, really catapulted my HR journey to new heights! Meeting people like Christine & Julie - I thought of them as HR celebrities (LOL, you all still are HR celebs!) - members Suzy Dyer-Gear, MAS, SPHR, SHRM-SCP and Tracey Ellison  encouraging me that I can obtain my Master's degree when I didn't see that for myself. Others encouraging me to go for certification.What I'm most grateful for, this professional membership group's volunteer leaders have always welcomed me (even when I felt like I wasn't on their level) and helped me figure out how to push myself to try new things, learn new ways of thinking or applying my KSAs, have critical conversations, and challenge me to provide the same support system for our future volunteer leaders. I ❤️ CC SHRM! #grateful #hr #ccshrm #leaders #thankyou

Sometimes we just need to thread water. It's been a challenging few days.My dads in hospital with COVID and my mum has it also. We had to call an ambulance three times this week and on the third ( yesterday) my dad  was taken in.The dog was losing his shit so we ended up putting him into kennels for a few days also. Grateful to be around to help and look after my parents with my sister, appreciate it's not everyone who can. As much as I know and understand my parents are getting older I didn't like seeing them so vulnerable this week. It's a funny old world, one minute your up the next  minute it's choas. But like everything, this too shall pass 🙏 #grateful #family #life

SO GRATEFUL to the lovely female bystander who helped my son then called me when he threw up, then collapsed, at Central Station today.

Now that's customer service! #customerservice #grateful #transportfornsw #sydneytrainsPS: My son is OK - he had a virus earlier in the week and probably overdid it racing to Cental on his pushbike to go on a riding adventure with friends.

Alhamdulillah! I've officially graduated from NED University of Engineering and Technology with a degree in 'Mechanical Engineering. I still remember during the time of my interview when only 1 seat for Mechanical was remaining and my turn was next to pick a field of study. I never thought I'd graduate from the University of my choice, in the field of my choice. All thanks to my parents for always believing in me even during times when I didn't believe in myself. Through the countless nights, I stayed up studying late, staying back at University to get a better understanding of the concepts we learned in class, the group study sessions, and the friends I've made for life. This journey in itself was surreal and I couldn't be more grateful.I simply can not wait for the next chapter of my life to begin and to apply my knowledge for the betterment of our environment, country, and society. Godspeed to each and every individual who is using their cognitive capital for the betterment of mankind because that I believe is the purpose of life.

There are different schools of thought in terms of posting about non-professional things on LinkedIn, but today I am #grateful for my hobbies!I don’t think hobbies take away from a professional life; I think they add to it — especially for someone like me who didn’t have a lot of challenges in my school career. (I mean as a student — teaching was very challenging!)When I was starting out post-college, my hobbies helped me learn perseverance and planning. Crocheting has helped sharpen my budgeting skills too 😂 #dailygratitude

Pain, Death and Depression here and there in this present time. I am not better of than those in such state neither am I serving you better than them.

I’ve been really interested with Howerton family history lately. I’ve been reading recently about Lewis and Clark exploring the Missouri country in 1804. Then remembered the first Howertons settled in west central Missouri in 1839, just 35 years after the Lewis and Clark expedition started. Grateful for some photos of my farming lineage. This is my great-grandfather Ivan, and great-great-grandfather John, 90 years ago taken right where I would be playing and farming as a teenager 7 decades later. What’s something you know about your lineage, about your story?  #farming #grateful #farmers #lineage

Hello LinkedIn family, I am not much of a writer but I just want to share my experience in the last three (3) years.The last 3 years has brought out the best in me so far, and I'm grateful to Almighty God for how much I have achieved in a short while.February 2019, I was enlisted for the compulsory one year #grateful national youth service Corp (NYSC) and I was posted to Northern Nigeria, Jigawa state to be precise (the 3rd poorest state in Nigeria). Families, close friends and advisers didn't think going there was a good idea, due to the high incidence of terrorism happening in the north, but i told them I was willing to try out the place. In my mind, I was looking for the appropriate audience where my little #humanitarian efforts would be grossly felt and where i would have real impacts on humanity, which i knew Lagos wasn't the best place.Camp life was interesting, and afterwards, I was deployed to a local government called Jahun in Jigawa state. In the local government, i was initially posted to the general hospital, but my LGI and the local government chairman felt I would be of better use in the Primary Health Centre (PHC) in a village within the local government. NB: This village PHC never had a doctor in its many years of existence. I was given a very comfortable and well-equipped accommodation. On seeing the committment of the community leaders in making me comfortable, I was further encouraged to stay.My #nysc days was full for service as the name implies (I'll try compose my achievements during nysc another time). I started working hard from day 1, looking at the finishing line as if it was sooner than it was. when I began working in the #community I knew I had a short period to make impact in the land.I started with the PHC which was my primary place of assignment, I trained the Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) on blood transfusion, after witnessing under five deaths from severe anaemia mainly secondary to malnutrition and malaria ofcourse with background poverty. I run Out-patient clinics for chronic diseases in the Elderly and Children including HIV/TB clinics.The facility was also served as one of the Basic Emergency Obstetrics and Newborn care centre (#BEmONC) for #MSF project based in the Jahun General hospital. This was how I got to know about the organisation called Medecins Sans Frontieres. And automatically, I became the doctor In the BEMONc throughout my stay there.March 2020, I completed my service and I had to go back to Lagos. i worked for about five (5) months, then I got an email to come for interview in MSFF Jahun project.To shorten the story, I got the job, and I learnt a whole lot in my 26 months of working there. Now, I got into the international pool of doctors in the organization. And I will be leaving for first mission as an #expatriate next week.I bless God for the success so far. And i appreciate my family, friends, mentors and well wishers, for their guidance and supports.

This time last year, it was hard for me to see where I was going.  Moving from private sector to government felt like an impossible transition with the barriers to effective change. Reconciling, healing from an injury, and gigging in start-up, one of many pots I have had my hand in this past year, seemed aspirational at best, but crazy enough to work at the ground level, to create catalyst change in the eco-system riddled with silos. I was somewhat right! ☑️Normally, I don’t go deep into comings and goings, but start-up can be tough, yet it has been for me, rich with reward! I have met and had the opportunity to serve some amazing leaders, but Friday concluded freelance work as Co-Founder & COO with HelaPlex. Everything has a start and finish and often a necessary ending! I am personally proud of what I have been able to accomplish and the networks that I have been able to grow and cultivate in such a short period of time and grateful to HelaPlex’s Founder & CEO, for the opportunity to leverage design and elevate an ambitious mission.  ‼️ To my young innovators – There is much work to do! #LetsGo  Interviews and concept design of late, fortified from many conversations, have pointed me back to what keeps me up at night Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. It too is tough, but it’s my Jam! ❤️ Getting to bring other pieces of my talent into work is super important to me and helping Executives and companies give permission to their employees to the same remains unbelievably gratifying!  These past couple of weeks have truly confirmed that I am walking in my purpose. #equitycantwait I can’t help it; I love People Centered Leadership and I am unapologetic in the work! #safeandbravespaces 💥 As I close this chapter, I am quite clear on my truest calling, and I am grateful for the support of colleagues who continue to help me champion change! I am even more grateful to those who continue to seek my Thought leadership in this ecosystem and across the U.S. I am grateful! 🙌🏾 I encourage you to continue to challenge your own capabilities and to chase PURPOSE! Leadership is imperfect and failing at times. Success leaves clues along the way, pick them up and revolutionize! ONWARD! To those who will walk through 2023 with me as their Executive Consultant and Coach.To those who know that THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING!!!👊🏾Looking for my next opportunity continues.

For the past few days I’ve been deeply practicing #gratitude  🙏🏾. What are you grateful for? ————————————I think we, in our busy lives, tend to overlook simple, yet truly necessary practices such as gratitude, self-care, family/friend bonding, and the like. Before we had all these labor systems, we had each other and we created these systems to help each other. 🤝 ————————————I’m taking my time to get back to our human roots through gratitude. I’m grateful for many things and I’m #grateful for you. #humanity #gratitude #mindfulness #peacebestill #peaceofmind

This one is about me. Saw that, and felt compelled to write about it. My childhood was not easy. Created some patterns in my mind and made me think of myself as a victim, a looser that will never amount to anything of value. Made me hate myself as a teen. I thought that I am stupid, unremarkable, mediocre. That I should just listen and do things others tell me to. Just give up on my own individual self and be a part of the crowd. The background noise. When I tried to be w bit more myself, I heard no - do not draw attention to yourself. Be like everyone else, be gray, do not stand out, blend into the background. This is how I have became a local government official as an young adult. Because that was my mothers dream and I barely existed. I was shy, with no faith in myself. So I stayed there for 8 years of my life, time I can never get back and suffered being mobbed and exploited. My tireless hard work was never valued, my long hours never seen. I felt trapped in my own life. I am a late bloomer, I was born in my 30s or should I say re-born? Because I started feeling angry. This life of mine was uncomfortable like, a stone in my shoe, chains on my legs. I understood finally that I have nothing to loose here, or more importantly I could loose it all - my life - if I continue on this path any further. I knew that to create a new life for myself I need to sacrifice the old one. I was scared, but happy to do it. I have changed my own victim mindset into seeing who I really am. A fighter. A glorious champion. A true fenix. I heard that chinese language is so hard to learn it's almost impossible - so I tried learning that language, and saw only something I need to put effort in, but doable. Not this absolutely impossible task. This experience blew my mind. I am not stupid. I am very intelligent, talented and capable. I can achieve anything I set my mind to. If I sit my a** and start learning a programming language - I will know how to code in some time. It's that easy. The only thing keeping me from reaching my full potential was my mindset. I was stuck in a cage inside my own head. I needed to forget everything I was taught and build myself from scratch. Forge myself into something beautiful and unique. Into me. This is me. You have no idea how hard it was to turn my life 180 degrees, but I am proud and grateful to be where I am now. Not just as an occupation, but me as a human being. I did my work and definately was #learningeveryday. You can do it too and go #fromzerotohero - just look deep inside yourself and ask: "am I happy?" and if the answer is no follow it with "what can I do to change that?" and you know what else? #nevergiveup on yourself and yourself. No matter what others tell you. Stop listening to them - this life is your own and it's you living it - not them. Good luck! I believe in you and just KNOW you can do it.  #mindset #learning #experience #change #grateful #hardworkSource: Goalcast

GIVING UP or SURRENDER?Exactly 10 days ago I went for a nice long swim at the pool in my neighbourhood public gym. It had been a long busy day of work and I appreciated unwinding with some cardio. I finished my laps, feeling amazing and grateful. I took a shower,got dressed and headed back home. On the way home I stopped at the supermarket to fetch some groceries and as I walked in the vegetables and fruits aisle I observed one of my earrings was missing. I checked in my hair as I had washed it and sometimes it gets caught, I didn’t find it anywhere.I immediately called the gym and they said nothing was handed in but to check again the next day. I traced all my steps back and the next day I went back to ask, but nothing had been handed in. I had a decision to make at this point:Do I #giveup on my hope and gracefully accept that’s it was “meant to be”OR Do I continue to search and give myself a couple weeks before I #surrender to the loss. What is the difference? If I #giveup, I have to possibly feel the by product symptoms of guilt, not having tried enough and quite possibly dealing with the “what if” narrative in my head and there’s a sense of defeat or failure. I also see giving up as a black or white solution. But not everything is that simple. When I #surrender, there is a sense of gentle acceptance after having done everything I could possibly do, this includes some asking around, being patient, putting forward my best #intention and #action to recover what is mine. I also find surrender to be a peaceful resolve for my mind and leaves a gentle door open, ushering new abundance in my life. Notice I had #noexpectations from either outcome, as I also knew it was a long shot to recover the tiny piece of jewellery.I took the option to #surrender. And this is what followed :1. I called everyday 📞 2. I went each day to train and spoke to the reception staff 🗣 3. I went to the pool and aquatinted with the lifeguard and asked her to request the cleaning staff to keep an eye out 👀 4. I checked the locker area, showers and general corners of the changing room🧐5. I spoke to the regular swimmers and told them I had lost an earring- showed them the other one and perhaps they might see something shining in the pool 🤷🏿‍♀️6. I said a gentle #prayer each time I went to the gym. This morning I went with my usual intention and the lost and found box 📦 was there again. They opened it, and…  there it was, sitting there in the top pile of other abandoned items. 🤩I felt #grateful and relieved to recover my earring but what I was most satisfied with was my perseverance and will of setting an intention and not having anything to expect, yet I was pleasantly rewarded. Do you resonate with my story and does it echo other surrending moments from your own life?
-----------------------------
I also want to express gratitude as well … ☀️ I am grateful that people around me showed their ‘true colours’ about how tolerant they really are☀️I am grateful for critical thinkers,  I wish I had more in my life  ☀️ I am grateful to know people who believe, like me, that a difference of opinion is not a reason to stay away from people, to isolate yourself or loved ones, and it also is not a reason to justify cruelty or discrimination ☀️I am grateful that my eyes were opened in 2020 as to the corruption in the media & govt and this was all because I believe in Alternative Medicine & Natural HEALTH over pharmaceutical fixes 💊☀️ I am grateful in having the courage to stand up for what I believe in, because I was able to open my heart up to soul alignment (life purpose) & inner peace ✝️☀️I am grateful for finding the courage to speak out about it publicly, (took me a while though) as there are people in the world who are still in the dark 💥I am grateful that I can continue to show love & kindness to a world that seems to despise it ☀️I am grateful for everyone who has supported and encouraged me to keep going ☀️I am grateful that even though I was treated badly by others (and sometimes still am), that I can still see other people through the lens of grace & imperfection 🙏Thank you  #gratitude #kindness #grateful #health #stress #stresswellness #community #pharmaceutical #grace #forgiveness #media

My heart goes out to each and every one of the incredible people at Twitter who were given their last day notice on Friday. Twitter provided me my first true career opportunity in Legal Policy and tech, and I will forever be grateful to the culture and genuine friendship that I experienced as a Tweep there. If you were affected by the mass layoff, or know someone who was, please feel free to reach out to this former Tweep. Whether it’s just to chat, vent, or discuss any potential opportunities that I may help you find, I’ll happily do whatever I can to support you. Cheers to all of you that made Twitter such an amazing place to work at 💙  #opportunity #Lovewhereyouworked #Tweep #oneteam #grateful

I got fired on Christmas Eve. By a church. With no warning.The Twitter firings remind me of the pain but also lessons learned.Here are 4 Lessons For Those Fired Without Warning:My boss and I met at Starbucks on Christmas Eve. With no warning, he let me go. I had just gotten married 6 months earlier (the boss had attended the wedding!) and we could barely afford our little apartment.I was shocked. Scared. Angry. But (spoiler alert), I didn’t die. Life continued and I grew a LOT.Here’s some lessons I learned through it:1. FORCED CHANGE CAN BE A BLESSINGAfter the firing, I got a job in Chicago. We moved from Oklahoma and proceeded to have an amazing season. I worked for a new place for six years and loved it.It wasn’t planned or expected but turned out to be good.2. CYNICISM IS FAIR, GRATEFULNESS IS HEALTHIERNobody will blame you for being raw or bitter. But cynicism is a virus. It spreads through your mind, infecting your opinions and behaviors. It makes you sick and not yourself.Gratefulness is harder and might take time, but it’s the healthy path forward. Life is a gift. It’s hard and sucks at times, but we still did nothing to earn it and goodness is all around us.3. EVERY CHANGE IS A CHANCE TO GROWHow can this unexpected change form you in new ways?Do you want to go back to school or take an online course?Could this be a time to reassess your skills and passions?Maybe this opens up space to focus on exercise or a forsaken hobby or old relationships?Don’t waste the pain and discomfort. Use it to grow and transform.4. NOW YOU KNOW WHAT "NOT TO DO"One of my mottos is to “treat people like humans not tools.” It came directly from my Christmas Eve firing. It wasn’t the firing itself, it was the lack of care and conversation and preparation.How can your situation teach you what "not to do?" You might be the boss or have to fire people or make difficult decisions. How can you do things differently?My Christmas Eve firing was a pivotal moment. Through the pain and shock, I grew and changed. I’m actually grateful for it now. May it be the same for you. May you use this moment to grow and be grateful.#jobloss #growth #change #grateful

Yesterday I said my final good bye to my Grandad. Who was actually more like my Dad then Grandad. I’ve lots of beautiful memories & over time I’m sure the hollow feeling in my chest won’t feel quiet so overwhelming. Grandads service was beautiful & I managed to stand up & do his eulogy without crying until the end. Something I was worried I wouldn’t manage. I would like to thank my employer University of Central Lancashire  for the supportive bereverment leave. My big boss Jane Anthony  for the unwavering support & beautiful emails. My manager Theresa Saxon  for the support & that teams chat she just let me vent & cry in. Simon Price  for being an incredibly supportive friend & mentor even at my lowest points. Dr Dianne Scullion  for being a constant support. I’m very lucky that I work with lots of supportive people. I’m grateful that I’ve not been pressured to rush back to work. But to take the time I needed mentally for myself & my family. My Nan & Grandad would of had their 64th wedding anniversary on the 8th November. My Nan has been with my Grandad since she was 16. Being able to be with her & Grandad while he took his last breath was so important to me. Being able to hold my Nans hand while she registered his death & all the other admin that was needed was important to me. Something I wouldn’t of been able to do if my employer had pressured me back to work. I’m returning Monday & already have a bursting diary. I return in the knowledge that my Managers won’t think less of me for needing to hit the pause button.  #university #work #grateful #uclangirl #family #bereavement

Method Workers’ Compensation was born! In the seven years since our founding, we’ve been grateful to help thousands of people receive better care so they can continue to work and provide for their families.

No more check-backs, no more 2am closes, no more summer holiday madness… no more free meals!Leaving now was never in my initial plan, but an opportunity was presented to me that I couldn’t refuse. Having said that, I can’t be more grateful for the endless support and priceless skills Nando's UK & IRE have given me during this time. However, it’s time for me to fly the nest and take on new challenges. Thank you to everyone at Nandos from my fellow Nandocas, to my Patrao and beyond.

I don’t normally post on linked in, but I wanted to give a life update. I went back to work this week after being off for the birth of my daughter. My company, Paligo, gave me 12 weeks off which is a big deal in the United States as we know there is no policy federally for maternity leave(which I won’t even get into because I could write a novelabout how it makes my blood boil). I am so grateful for the time I had because not only did I get to bond with my new baby but I had the time I needed to heal and adjust to the new “normal”. Now I’m transitioning again, as going back to work means navigating parenthood with working and having my daughter start daycare. This first week back was really hard, I won’t lie. But Paligo has made the transition as smooth as possible. I’m so thankful to work for a company that understands truly what work/life balance means and gives me the flexibility to do my job and take care of my family. I know others are not as fortunate and I’m not taking my situation for granted at all. I am excited to get back into my role, interact with my amazing team, keep growing professionally, and still feel like I can be an amazing mom at the same time.❤️ #workingmom #maternityleave #customersuccess #grateful

One of my favorite parts of getting older is having the wisdom to know that the worst times lead to the best growth. Last summer, within the span of 2 months, I lost my father, my cat, got COVID, and was unexpectedly let go from my job of 7 years. I needed to take a beat. So much loss at once created a brain fog I knew wasn’t ideal for choosing my next career move. But I was not given any safety net, needed to have a little cash flow, and was fortunate enough to pick up some freelance work.Several people also encouraged me to attend Start-Up Week, where I made some incredible connections. A few clients from the past reached out, and suddenly, I didn’t even need to find another job. Yesterday I filed for an LLC, and officially rented out my own amazing co-working space. I miss my Baba (dad), so much and all the time. But I cannot remember the last time I felt this excited for the future. I have so much gratitude for the community of people who have helped get me out of bed, and back on my feet. Who have championed me and created opportunities for me to pursue a dream. I don’t know what the future will be. This may or may not work out. But regardless, I’m so grateful for all of it. All of this loss has allowed me to be on this path, and given me a clearer vision into my own talent, drive, and value. It’s provided me with the opportunity to reinvigorate my creativity, passion, and motivation. Baba always said, “when you stop losing you start gaining”. I’m finally realizing my worth again, and finding a sense of purpose. My income is better, my sleep is better, and my work is better. And while I have my moments frozen in grief, I am better. Or at least getting a little closer to that every day.#motivation #opportunities #growth #creativity #future #freelance #grateful #gratitude #community

Look where we started, and look where we're at! ✨Storytelling is something that I both enjoy and look forward to, because being an imaginative person myself, it gives me a thrill when I can excite, inspire, or intrigue people by my words.And what better than to tell a story about yourself?I was recently nominated as a D&I champion at SAP, by an amazing colleague, guide, friend, and mentor (Shilpi, ever grateful to you for so many things). While the nomination in itself felt so humbling, it led to something special. 🎈My dear colleague Marcus gave me an opportunity to speak with a cohort of SAP catalysts on the topic of #diversityandinclusion and my experience with D&I at SAP over the past 5 years. Over the course of two amazing virtual BYOB corners, I got to relive my own adventures in D&I, while (hopefully) also helping a few more like-minded, and far more talented peers see the value in taking up allyship and advocacy. 🙌🏻It's been a bad week but for those two hours, I was in such a nostalgic mood, and I felt truly proud of what I have been able to achieve (which doesn't happen to me very often, but maybe that's life's way of balancing out the other annoying occurrences that frequent my everyday experiences).SAP Labs India - thanks for giving me the opportunity to experience all I can and become a kinder person. I owe so much to you! 💜PS: Soleil, that ever smiling face and the encouraging nods, what did I ever do to deserve you? 😭💫#diversity #inclusion #people #storytelling #sap #grateful #opportunity #experience

A young person was once asked by their mentor, “if I give you $1,000,000 right now, how would that make you feel?”The young person replies, “Relief. I will pay all of my debts and I’ll be happy.”The mentor replied, “Ok well, what if I give you $1,000,000 right now, but you don’t wake up tomorrow? Would you still want the money?”“No, of course not! I wouldn’t do it.” The young person exclaimed.The mentor stepped up his game and asked, “Ok what if I give you $10,000,000 right now, but you still don’t wake up tomorrow?”The answer was still “No!”The mentor replies, “Just for the fact that you told me that you want to open your eyes and wake up tomorrow morning, you value your life more than millions of dollars. There is no price for being able to wake up in the morning. Yet, many people take it for granted.”Why do we complain that we HAVE to wake up early to go to work. Why don’t we say, “Today, I GET to go to work? Or what about about complaining that we HAVE to pay our rent and bills? Why don’t we say instead, “Today, I GET to pay my rent and bills?” Why do we not fight for our goals and dreams every single day like it’s our last? Why don’t we wake up every morning feeling like the richest person on earth, just for the fact that we woke up?Each of us have a purpose during this brief journey called life. Let’s value it and not take it for granted. Let’s be grateful that today we woke up and ask ourselves what can I do today to get one step closer to fulfilling my purpose?Because, one day, we won’t wake up.Today, I’m grateful to wake up to another day and for being able to spend a few days back home in the US with my family.Good morning from Utah, USA 🇺🇸 #people #work #grateful #money #life #gratitude

His aura is so charismatic that the tickets to his show are sold out within minutes of the announcement.🧿The aura of the place makes it a favourite tourist spot.Her smile is so beautiful that it rains an aura of love wherever she goes. What's the buzz around Aura?In fact the world of existence revolves around the trajectory of aura.When we meet someone or go to a place and feel extremely happy or pleasant, we often connect it with the aura.Say for instance, it is how good we feel when we hold a new born baby or a toddler in our arms. It is the highest and purest form of energy they spread. When we interact with people whom we love whether a family member or a friend, we feel joyful, special and cared for, unconditionally.At times we meet some strangers who help us sail through a rough path in life and we are ever grateful to them because our paths crossed. Often you feel tired or claustrophobic for no specific reason in a bus, train, mall or any public place. The presence of a cluster of energies can drain the good vibes in such cases.The aura around serene and sacred places of worship is high which is why people go there to bring the positive energies into their lives. People who are well-read, disciplined in life, respectful, humble, spiritual, righteous, grateful, kind, simple, happy, peaceful, helpful, generous, honest, brave and truthful radiate good aura. They know how to guard their energy through meditation and mindfulness practices.Wondering what's your aura? The very thought of you, if it brings a calm or a smile or a happy feeling to someone, even from miles away,  it means that your aura is on the positive side.When your presence brings joy and instant solutions in any dire situation, you are doubly blessed with a divine aura.It's pretty easy to check your own aura. Just look into the mirror and smile 'naturally'. The aura that you feel when you are unpretentiously yourself, that will encircle a special aura, around you.Make a list of people or places that made you feel blissful and blessed. The power of aura expands with love, which is the highest virtue in the universe. Think good and nurture your aura with best hues of love, and peace. #day5 #auramatters #mindfulnesspractice #lifeisbeautiful #grateful #energy #power

One of the things I like best about what I do is I get to spend time with industry leaders diving deep into their businesses.

Kudos to so many!Although the book has my name as author, there is so much more to writing a book.  It is truly a team effort, not a one person job.Publishers, editors, marketing teams, illustrators, mentors, family, friends… without you, no matter how big or small your role, it was made possible.  I appreciate you all and consider you an integral part in the success of launching my first book. THANK YOU!#grateful #teamwork #authour #firstbook #RelentlessAF #relentless #leadershipbooks #thankyou

Hello everyone! I had recently participated in a "Mixed Signal SoC Design Marathon using eSim and SKY130", organized by FOSSEE, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, and Google along with VLSI System Design. This was an open hackathon conducted in the months of September-October. There were over 2700 registrations and I'm happy to share that I have been declared one of the winners for the same. My circuit, "Mixed Signal FSM Sequence Detector" has been recognized as one of the circuits in the "Very Good" category. Link: https://lnkd.in/gXG4iKHvDuring the hackathon, we had to use tools like eSim, SKY130 PDK, Verilog, and SPICE. This was my very first time working with a mixed signal circuit and my first ever VLSI hackathon. I'm grateful to have been included in the list of winners. It was a brilliant learning experience and this has helped me get introduced to the concept of Mixed Signals. I would like to thank kunal ghosh (vlsisystemdesign.com), Sumanto Kar, and the entire team for their guidance and for organizing this amazing event! I can't wait to try out more circuits and explore the domain of mixed signals.#design #experience #learning #event #google #grateful #technology #vlsi#vlsidesign #mixedsignal #soc #verilog #spice #esim #hackathon #iitbombay #vsd #opensource #opensourcecommunity #iit #google #hardware #digitaldesign

The Venue and Live Event industry never stops, and I am grateful.  (No, it did not stop during the pandemic, we slowed, and modified, and adjusted, but we did not stop)Today I am going to depart a bit from some of my recent posts about growth, teamwork, mentoring, sales and operations.Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays.  I enjoy and appreciate it for the entire month of November.  Not because of the turkey, or the stuffing, or any of the other food and beverages of the day, not because of the football games, not because it is a "day off" for many, not because it marks the traditional beginning of the holiday season for many people, but because I AM full of Thanks each and every day.  Gratitude is one of my Blessings and I find the more I have, the more I find Blessings in almost everything.To me, thankfulness and gratitude are a way of life, an attitude, a choice.  Every day I see things that make me grateful.  No, it's not always easy but it is always rewarding.I would write for days if I were to attempt to list the things I am grateful for today.  If this feels more like a personal post than a business post, I understand, but for me, business and personal are intertwined.  Many of my best friends are people I have worked with for years.  Some I still do, some from the past, but those friendships surpass the working relationship we may have started with long ago.  I am grateful for those opportunities.I wish everyone a fulfilling, safe, and enjoyable holiday season.  Hopefully at some point we can all find some time to step back, reflect on where we have been, where we are, and where we are going and appreciate the journey.  God Bless.  #business #sales #event #people #football #opportunities #growth #grateful #gratitude #food #teamwork #mentoring #saturdayatwork #aegsev #empirepoloclub #aeg #aegpresents #goldenvoice #thanksgiving #thankful #gratitude #love #bekind #helpyourfriends #journey #enjoytheride #liveevents #venues #operationsmanager #productionmanager #accountant #generalmanager #marketing

I went from having only 6 weeks unpaid leave planned with my baby to a full 2 years thanks to the Covid layoffs. I wouldn’t have it any other way and have been very blessed!!! #grateful Companies need to improve their policies on after birth leave - not just maternity leave, but allow the father that early bonding time too! Do more than what #fmla offers! You know what helps a ton even though most people don’t offer this type of help… food! If I didn’t prep a large batch of gumbo in portion sizes in the freezer and a few other meals, I would have really struggled. #help Know someone who just had a baby? Offer food - take out or cook/bake/roast/grill, anything. If they have older children, offer to take them out of the house.

wow wow wow!!!Writing and publishing a book is an interesting endeavor because so much goes into it - like I mean your heart and soul and guts and tears and frustration and joy and all of it. You receive the initial fan fare when it publishes and then like so many things, it seems to fade away into the backdrop and you never really know if it's fulfilling the intention you hoped for. Yesterday I was gifted an audio testimonial that touched me deeply and made me cry. It came from an incredible Goddess I just met in Slovenia at the The Transformational Travel Council@Theresa Akua Powell thank you for seeing me, for deeply receiving the transmission I intend to send through Original Wisdom: Harness the Power of the Authentic You.

Time for a Professional Update: -It's time to say goodbye to FHRAI after over 1.5 years of service. The voyage has been incredible; I've learned so much. The nicest element of my career was the opportunity to work closely on various government projects. I will always be honoured and proud of myself for having played such a significant role in the achievement of FHRAI-IHM. Building a brand from the scratch has always been a goal of mine, and FHRAI provided me with the opportunity to do so. I shall be eternally grateful for the opportunity to work under Dr. Himanshu Talwar. He not only made me learn about things, but he also led me through each stage of life. He made sure I always took the proper approach to developing my profession. Sir, I gratefully acknowledge all of your advice.I also want to express my sincere gratitude to Akash Upadhyay.  As time flew by from a senior employee, he became an elder brother to me in my life. I will always be grateful for our time together. He was always there to help me grasp things, whether it was via our conversations, laughs, or calming me when I became agitated. He is the one I can reach at any moment to discuss an irrelevant subject. I sincerely appreciate your kindness, care, and support, sir. Wherever I move, I'll always surely miss you as a seatmate.It's time to relax for a few days before starting on a new path in life.In a few days, I'll provide an update on my new voyage.#work #opportunity #career #brand #projects #gratitude #kindness #grateful #building #stage

For my network peers who know me personally, you know the battle my father has fought for the last five years - he is a champ, he is my hero, he taught me the fundamentals of business, he is undoubtedly the strongest man I have ever met, and I am so incredibly proud to have him as my dad.My dad doesn’t have prostate cancer specifically, but he does have a very rare and aggressive cancer he’s battling to this day. My family and I are forever grateful to the doctors, nurses, and medical professionals at Rush University Medical Center 🙏. Thank you so incredibly much.My wish is that no one has to face cancer but, unfortunately, it won’t be cured overnight. It will continue wreaking havoc on families across the globe daily and it’s incumbent upon on us as a society to help minimize the challenges patients and families face as they fight their battle.To raise Men’s Health and Cancer awareness, my team and I at DHL are “Letting the Mo Grow” and participating in Mo-Vember.

Reflections...Ways in which my profession has enhanced and impacted 💥 my life and #human experience...A year ago today (still coming to terms with the reality that it has been a year) I moved on from one of the most transformational experiences of my career. For me, the last year has been unimaginably centering, taking stalk of my motivations, meeting and re-meeting more amazing humans, working with incredible companies, and outlining passion ❤ pursuits. In reflecting on my time at Acuitas Health I realized that a large portion of my growth came from the incredible humans around me. The opportunity to be with caring ❤ , off-the-charts intelligent 🤓, energetic ⚛ , and curious 🤔 people everyday is the opportunity of a lifetime and I couldn’t be more grateful for them (there are many, and you know who you are).Below are some of my parting words to the staff. I recall writing and reading this to the staff fondly and filled with emotion ❤ :“It is with mixed emotions that I announce that I will be moving on from Acuitas Health. The last 5 years have been some of the most rewarding years of my professional life. It's rare to start something from scratch, and work with a team that has achieved so much! Our stakeholders have given us the amazing opportunity to test and implement positively disruptive ideas in local healthcare. You all have made this journey amazing every second along the way. Thank you for being truly excited by and engaged in the vision of supporting providers in improving health and health care; provider intimacy, and patient centricity. Thank you for all that you have done for me, and all that you do for Acuitas. I will sincerely miss you all and the intelligence, energy, and passion you bring to your work. There are few things more motivating for me than to see you solving tough problems every day. You are a strong team, you support each other, and I could not be more proud of who you are, what you've accomplished, and what is next for you. The coming weeks will be busy as I transition out of the company; please know that I value each of you, and if there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to reach out.”Among many things, you’ve taught me that I am energized 🔋 by your personal and professional success. Your drive is my drive.You motivate me. Reach out. Let’s have coffee ☕ , or chat. #gratitude #grateful #team #people #talent #care #motivation #positivity #human #work #drive #health #healthcare #reflecting #success #career

Few days ago, i received my schedule back to work and immediately reflected on some competencies i did not realized i was doing while on leave.Adaptability: Continuously adapted to ever-changing situations w/ a newborn, learnt to deal w/ ambiguity, always looking for positive attitude in stressful situations.  Navigated several emotional & physical rollercoasters including postpartum recovery, sleep deprivation, & constant exhaustion. Adds up attention for the other 2 toddlers i have on how to entertain them.Collaboration: Have to huddle w/ family on who to look after to, what is needed to be done & most is to provide utmost love & care to the little one as he is new to the world.  Sourced constant hugs & swings to the little one when the parents needed rest through the presence of close family including traveling to outside UAE & staying in Egypt for more than 2 months without husband. This one really helped me developed my kids and exposed them to other people & outside world and bringing my “me time” back to myself w/ the help of family members & the community we living in.Drive for results: Quickly developed knowledge needed to deliver on critical objectives of keeping the little one alive and thriving whilst entertaining the other two not to get bored & jealous of the new joiner. Seriously, have to maintain pumps on point to have his food whilst doing the things for the other two.  I remember driving my car w/ the 3 kids & our ate alone to go outside after a month of surgery as my mom has to travel back to Philippines.Plans and Aligns: Researched, planned & scoped strategies around wake times, meal times & diaper changes to achieve longer stretches of sleep at night or at least time for me to breathe. What to do for a week for the other 2 to keep them engaged & entertained while thinking of how my little one will be enjoying time as well.Values Differences: My family comes from two different continent & having that said, sometimes we struggle in customs & traditions we get used to. Exposing them to my husband’s home country is not a bad idea at all as they are exposed to family traditions, community difference & real life situations they never experienced here in the UAE.  As I’am transitioning back to work, I’am very appreciative of the support I get from my company as I plan my work days w/ an infant & toddlers at home. I’am excited to work w/ even more purpose & glad about the opportunities I’m about to encounter to make an impact on people's lives same as how my company impacted mine.  I’am so thankful for my family both UAE & Egypt home as I will never survive w/o them.  Lastly, to my husband who drives me nuts always but awakens me to see more things clearly & driven.  Thanking him for forcing me spend and value myself as i found myself giving them much more than i expected i can.  He gave back my “me time” to enjoy & love myself first so I can love them more than ever.#grateful #family #motherhood #value #workingmoms

Just like my beady-eyed friend here staring straight into my soul, I have been looking into getting my photographs into galleries. It is so difficult to find a gallery that wants to even sell photo prints. They will sell paintings and prints of paintings but not photographs. I have received a lot of great positive responses to my photographs on here and on many other social media platforms.Well, today a very prestigious and far-reaching gallery has asked to me send some digital files to their team, to see if my work meets their standard and to see if my work fits in with their clientele's tastes.Thankfully they recognise photographers as Fine Art Artists as well as those who paint in different mediums.For this, I am grateful, as some photographs have taken hours to capture that one shot or wait for months to get the right natural colours or travel to distant locations to bring something beautiful into someone's home or office.  #socialmedia #like #team #work #travel #grateful #fineart #photographers #digital #home #gallery #galleries

For everyone who's been sending emails and private messages asking about my #memoir, I've got an update: the book cover is nearly finalized, and Mekiya and I are really excited about the design!!! All my family members love it and have describe it to me in great detail, enabling me to visualize and love it, too. This #book is one of the biggest accomplishments of my life, alongside earning the #Fulbright and becoming a #journalist. I want to thank all my friends and loved ones because without their support, not just while working on this book, but throughout my life, I wouldn't have been able to grow into the person I am today. Even this book cover is a gift from one of my best friends, to whom I'm incredibly grateful.

*** Champions in all forms.Last night I got to support the Gillette Wild Hockey Team. So much energy, great friends and fun!!! The team did amazing even though complications at the facility added a delay and made it extra cold. 🥶 That’s what being a champion is all about right? Conquering the difficult? I’m not good at dealing with the cold so I was in awe of the support, fan loyalty and enthusiasm regardless of the situation. Such a broad range of people and ages, all coping with the changes, eager to cheer their team through it. The unity of the chilled, loyal faces was inspiring. There is no limit when the mind is determined to overcome. Thankful for the little things, strong examples and the opportunity to absorb it. Also thankful for simple stuff like a heated vest! 😆 Nose was cold, but the rest was warm!!!! 😆🤣#grateful #support #littlethings #humor #champions #mindpower

#Grateful - November kicks off the #NAHLMilitaryAppreciation month. I am so grateful to play a role in an organization that strongly believes in supporting our military members and their families. Although the Wolverines only have three home games during the month, I made sure to incorporate as much programming from different branches of service from Alaska's Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson. Last night, we featured the U.S. Air Force & Air National Guard as our featured military branch of the game. We included special in-game messaging, a recruitment table, and a tug of war during the first intermission. It was a great night (especially because we won in overtime!) I was then blown away that the Technical Sergeant presented me with a Certificate of Appreciation and a Leadership Coin from the squad commander. He said we both have a strong passion for what we do in our respective fields, and encouraged me to continue to foster and pass on being a leader in the community. Will do TSgt! #MilitaryAppreciation #Community

He believed that there were many employees working on a single task and what not.Today Jack Dorsey breaks silence on layoffs."Folks at Twitter past and present are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment. I realize many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that", Jack wrote on Twitter He further added," I am grateful for, and love, everyone who has ever worked on Twitter. I don't expect that to be mutual in this moment...or ever…and I understand." #grateful #love #twitter #jobs #india #post #share #linkedin #linkedinpost

Thanks a bunch to each one of you who took time to send me good wishes and blessings on my birthday. 🙏 'Birthday' is a day that marks as completion of one more year of life. What I believe is our 'attribute' must be such that is worthy of receiving good wishes and blessings from people (known or unknown) each day. That makes one's life worth living. Each blessing means a lot to me. My life's journey is going great in terms of my 'mission' of bringing positive shifts in people's lives, caring for Mother Earth, Nature, Birds & Animals (in whatever way i am able to do), Oneness with the Universe, moving towards Acension, and each moment is gracefully taking me towards my life purpose. Grateful to the contribution of people who supported my journey so far 😇Om Namah Shivaye 🙏Love & Light to all🌟Shradha Dhanuka#gratitude #divinity #goodwishes #blessings #thankyou #positivity #grateful

India has a flourishing startup ecosystem, although these creative ventures face numerous challenges and struggle for existence. Start-up is all about self-discovery and learning. Most startups emerge with an extraordinary dream, though these dreams entail a lot of dedication and hard work to build into reality. It takes much more than a brilliant idea to become a startup that grows to succeed.The biggest challenge with startups in the 21st century is the fear of embracing failure. It is important to dream, have the ambition and vision to set the bars high to enter a whole new world of startups that will drive strengths, diversity and intensify the economy of the country like India.Working in a startup offers you the best chances of rapid personal growth. Based on your work, your ideas and the growth of the company, you can rise rapidly to higher positions without having to spend a mandatory number of years at a specific post unlike normal private or government jobs .Grateful to Winzera Official for taking the initiative to harness the hidden potential of every working professional and helping them to maximize & actualize their vision to reality so that they can become the best version of themselves in all the hemispheres of life with an overall holistic development. #work #jobs #india #growth #learning #startup #development #startups #like #diversity #creative #economy #grateful

One of my favorite things about weekends is that I can often spare a few hours to read a book. Reading is one of my favorite activities, so this is what I am particularly thankful for today. The power of words and the power of story never ceases to amaze me. Words can inspire, console, give hope and strength, change your perspective, bring understanding, and change your life. (They can also do a lot of damage when used recklessly, but that’s a different subject.)Like all blessings, this blessing of reading rests upon many other blessings — loving parents, food, clothing, and shelter, security and education. Not to mention libraries, authors, publishers, booksellers, governmental stability, and the freedom to enjoy literature! I am grateful for all these things, and grateful that today I can finish reading a good book. 📚 #grateful #books #reading #education

The Ark is such a treasure of Ann Arbor! If you haven’t checked it out, we highly recommend it! We recently got a membership and want to start supporting more artists by attending, especially local artists. Last night we saw Amanda Shires and her band, which was amazing! The night before, we saw an excellent Concert for Peace, where proceeds go to “Vets for Peace” to support academic pursuits of nonviolent conflict resolutions. I am grateful to live in a city that supports creativity and positive causes. Also, the Ark is acoustically one of the best spaces I have been in also. And the people who work there and the volunteers are the nicest. #creativity #grateful #people #work #music

Long story- short.The era where everything it's moving and changing #fast . This morning, me and my college colleagues had to complete a #technological task. A little complicated for those who have not had much to do with certain #software tools.I have to admit I'm still #learning many things when it comes to #technology, just because sometimes I feel that I am an old soul trapped in this #century.   In any case, some colleagues took more than half a day to complete the #task, yesterday. Some of them haven't even finished today.  As for me, it took me exactly 10 minutes, this morning.  Not to show off. The thing is that I've been thinking about it since yesterday. And I was little "afraid" that I'm not going to do it alone. But I took some time to make my own #logic and find a way to solve it, first in my 🧠.  At least to #try.  In my head I created the #priorities list and the most important #steps , where I should #start and where I should arrive. I thought about the in-between as the simplest and most efficient way to get there.I told them I did it. In 10 min.  One of my colleagues told me that I did a "#PARKOUR" over all the steps that all the others did, but he congratulated me since we had the same result, the one #expected . I didn't understood what he meant, just because I didn't knew the #meaning of the word. What I knew was that I did it. The #result was good. Same as for the ones that followed all the steps to get there. I went and checked the word on Google Here is the meaning :"ParkourSportsDescriptionParkour is an athletic training discipline or sport in which practitioners attempt to get from point A to point B in the fastest and most efficient way possible, without assisting equipment and often while performing artistic-gymnastic maneuvers. " In that moment I realised what I did in the last few months of my life.How the three words hit me in the face like a flash : DISCIPLINE, FASTEST, EFFICIENT. How I acted towards myself and the #opportunities that have appeared in my life recently. The doors that opened to me. How I set myself up for what I chose to do.The moral of the story:  A real fighter and survivor will always find a way, but only if the will is there. #grateful  🙏  #technology #software #opportunities #google #logical #efficency #smartmove #discipline #fastforward #LinkedIn

Here is another quick thought that might be useful to you.Opportunities come and go.We are all humans and miss out on many of those opportunities in our lifetime.Don't blame or beat yourself up that much because the actual culprit is procrastination.At least, that's what everyone says; it is responsible for many of the failures, which has added to the already popular evil stereotype.I actually have a different view of procrastination, but this is not a way to change your overall outlook on it.You know that the end of a decision justifies the perception, whether good or bad.First of all, procrastination is a decision that is willingly taken, just like any other decision.In business, it can come off as putting off allocating resources to a project, not following up on a sales prospect, or not making that critical call.One of the many untold advantages of procrastination is that it has saved more emotionally driven people from life-threatening situations or even death.Procrastination has also saved more people from costly career decisions.Maybe because many people are hypertensive and depressed, they might not survive the impact of things going bad as a result of making a decisive investment.Impulsiveness tries to balance things out, but that only makes matters worse.Generally, life is unpredictable, so take every day as it comes and be grateful for the little wins or big ones, especially for life and a new day to right your past wrongs. Several people were unlucky to live to see another day to correct the bad effects of procrastination.So if you are about to give up, remember that "late" is a word that exists only in our heads, and for a better understanding of time, it is only what we perceive it to be and an experience of time that differs by person.Your lesson from your experience and that of others is the only solution to resolving the negative effects of procrastination on your life goals and being grateful for the positive effects.#business #opportunities #project #change #like #people #sales #experience #investment #grateful #career

Hello, I’m currently conducting research on Skincare for my final major project at  Southampton Solent University. This goes towards my final grade and so I need a large number of people all different ages and genders to fill out this questionnaire if possible. If anyone could take 5 minutes to fill out this questionnaire I would be really grateful. Even if you are not a skincare user please still fill out the form as it helps me understand more about consumer feelings. If you have any questions please do let me know, thank you again!https://lnkd.in/eG8pQbxw #skincare #thankyou #grateful #people #research #project #university

Tomorrow I return to work following 18 weeks as primary carer of these two rascals (3 if you include the dog). When I started my career I never envisioned the opportunity to spend such an extended period at home with my children, being present for soo many incredible milestones. I am extremely grateful to Stryker  HR and my team which allowed me this opportunity. It has honestly been the most beautiful, challenging, rewarding experience of my life, and has all but confirmed that mums are genuine super hero’s 😂 Kate Ferrari-Jones William Townsend Nicki Luther Maurice Ben-Mayor Stryker #wearestryker #stryker #team #work #career #hr #grateful #opportunity #experience

Most of us live in our past and let the past direct our life. Why do we focus on the past and let that affect our day? We should let go of all that was before because we can not change history but we can use the experience and embrace the changes we can get if we just love every day as a new beginning. Go out and just be open-minded to see the beauty that surrounds us all. Just be grateful for everything. Look at a bird and just stop for a while and look close. Everything could be just amazing if you see the small things. This should make you more happy or relaxed if it does not then just focus until you will start to be grateful for all that is. Because we can not change or benefit from the negative things or be happy if we are angry or upset about everything that we can not control from the past. We all can start over and be happy with everything. Just stop and see the beauty to be alive. Most of us just live in stress and bad habits that will not change the future. Once you see and enjoy everything that makes you happy your life will let go of the past and the future will look different. Do not fight and hold back because life is just too amazing to not enjoy. So use your time we have wise because we have just one life.Lars Andersson#experience #future #change #beauty #love #grateful

God is TrustworthyOne of my favorite songs is called, "Trust and Obey," because it talks about daily walking with Jesus, and how blessed we are when we remember that He guides the decisions we make. We step out in faith knowing that what we need will be provided in God's perfect way and time. When we trust God, we are compelled to do better, to love deeper with greater endurance. We can face our giants because we know without a doubt that we are not alone, we give thanks that the battle has already been won. God's loving presence gives us hope for tomorrow.#inspire #grateful #trust #hope #perfecttiming #God #Jesus #facegiants #provision

Ah, November ! So colorful and beautiful, especially when the weather here in New York has been so sunny and the temperatures this weekend will be 70 degrees.. truly loving the warmer weather, its so glorious!Am so thankful also to see all the gorgeous colors of the leaves on every tree, a truly spectacular display on Long Island that makes any view of the island so blissful.As there is so much to be thankful for, especially this time of year, our dreams, our health, our partners, families, friends, pets, a warm house, a helpful hand, nature, a smile, art and music, gratitude can bring so much joy to our lives.When gratitude is expressed, like Feng Shui principles, this helps to center and refocus our lives as well as balances the energy within ourselves and our environment by creating harmony and joy when we see the positive even in challenging times.In Feng Shui design, Joy is an energy of the Children and Creativity Gua (of Bagua energy map) where it is an actual energy space located in the west part of our homes. It is a space that creates joy as it provides us an area to display our creativity and our projects where we can sit back, relax, have fun, and enjoy and appreciate the successes of our work.In the Five Elements Theory, the Children and Creativity/Joy Gua is also supported by the Metal Energy, which is the same energy for Autumn (See “Falling for Autumn” blog post).Below is an example of design elements that contain the Metal Energy to enhance a design space to relax in and enjoy our creativity and projects, to manifest more appreciation and joy in our environment and lives. Do you notice the similarities of the color and shapes in the design to reflect this element?As with time, nature and people constantly changing, our environment within the home does too. Feng Shui provides the methods and tools to change our environment to create harmony in our lives to manifest abundance. A successful Feng Shui design can occur whether big or small adjustments are made.To learn more about proper space planning in your home for any design style, as well as to balance the energy of a design space for this upcoming holiday season, click Link in Bio for Free Discovery Call.To purchase products, click link “Thankful for November Products”.What are you grateful for this month?#interiordesign #fengshui #November #grateful #appreciation #creativity #joy #success #relax #selfdiscovery #enhanceyourhomeenrichyourlife #thanksgiving #homedecorideas #

I am constantly #learning and honing my skills, both in terms of technical knowledge and creative thinking.

In the day to day work it can be easy to forget that the no-kill movement is completely transforming an industry that was once based on disposing of unwanted pets. This honor from Fast Company is a great reminder of how Best Friends Animal Society is leading the charge with innovative and creative strides to shift the purpose of our industry to lifesaving and community support. I’m grateful to work alongside compassionate and purposeful colleagues to drive this change to make the world a better place for people and pets. #grateful #community #change #transformation #innovation #creative

A few things I am Grateful for1. My family who are always there for me no matter what2. My Home to protect my family from the elements3. My local Community of Family and friends. Without them I would be lost.4. My Business community for the Support that I receive on a daily basis.5. My online business that is helping my family find and experience their dreams6. Of course my puppy's who are always Sooooo Happy that I came home. Even if I am only gone for a few minutes. Peeing on the floor in happiness is the true definition of love!!!!There are things that we are all grateful for that go unrecognized because they are "just a part of life"Take a moment today to jot down your gratitude's. Actually writing/Typing them out makes you think about all of the great things in your life.If you get in a habit of writing out your gratitude's first thing each morning you will start off your day on the right foot and really have a great day.So many inspirational courses and seminars say the same thing so it must be effective.#gratitude #dailygratitude #grateful #inspiration #inspirational #family #home #puppy #love #witchwoodsolutions #thedanielpollard #business #community #experience #happiness #writing WitchWood Solutions

Recently, a conversation concerning supportive leadership got me thinking. It posed the question, “How is executive leadership supportive when you don’t have regular direct contact with onsite personnel?”Perhaps many corporate / executive leaders ask themselves, “How am I contributing to the success of my teams when I am not directly involved on a 1 on 1 basis with my onsite team members?” The answer is this; executive leadership impacts by example & providing positive support to the senior leadership with whom they are directly in communication. Then those leaders are able to positively impact those in their charge.  And so on & so on. It’s a trickle down effect. Never underestimate the importance your support, encouragement & positivity has your organization. The impact is HUGE & greatly appreciated! Your energy has a ripple effect to all those you lead. You do not go unnoticed for providing the mentorship & pathway to success. So to all our leaders, WAY TO GO! 🤩Great job on leading with love & dedication! You are AMAZING & we are grateful for you!

And after the packaging is dickied and dolled up with a company’s logo and labelling....most tubes look simply lovely.  And did you know that even after you think that you have squeeeeeezed the veeeeery last milligram of product out of the tube.......the tube is definitely not empty? A good 5 to 10 grams worth....or maybe even more product is still left in the tube that ends up in the landfill....and so too do some of your earned greenbacks. Here's a tip....cut the tube in increments to get every last milligram of product out and dispose of the tube....being mindful of recycling. So wherever it is that you are....and whatever it is that you are up to....do remember to 'cut it out' for the sake of our Bella Planet....remembering that small changes start with us. Like to know more on what Bella Bellini Botanics stands for?....you can do so here⤵https://lnkd.in/gygV6Bjor Link to LinkTree in our IG Bio and click on Website Homepage at ⤵https://lnkd.in/ej8vwmE Heather#CutItOut #WasteNotWantNot #Recycle #MindFulLiving #SmallChangesStartWithUs #BeingAwareNotGormeless #AllThingsVegan #VeganSkincare #VeganGoodness #Vegan #PlantBasedIngredients #ShopOnLine #OnLineStore #CleanSkinCare #NaturalSkincare #Grateful #Thankful #Happy #AbundantlyBlessed #ArtisanSkincare #BellaBelliniBotanics #BBB #TripleBc#AnAttitudeOfGratitude #FeelingFabulous #EnjoyingWhatIDoBest #FuelledByPassion
