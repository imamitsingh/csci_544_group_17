Hi everyone, my time at Twitter has abruptly come to an end! I was part of a team of data scientists which was cut by almost 80 percent. However, I am grateful to have gotten this chance to work with some of the most kind, bright, and hard working people I know üíô¬†During these ~2 years at Twitter, I‚Äôve learned a ton in the ads space, worked on high impact prediction projects like campaign planner, request prioritization etc. to deliver value to users, advertisers, and Twitter. Beyond the work itself, I am glad to say that I made great friends whom I‚Äôll cherish for a long time üòáFor my next chapter, I am actively looking for challenging opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, Analytics domains. Constrained by the visa related issues, I have limited time to find a new role and would really appreciate all the help I can get! If you are hiring or would like to share open positions, please reach out. Thanks in advance!#twitter #lovewhereyouworked #datascience #machinelearning #analytics #layoffs #openforwork

I feel lucky to have had the opportunity of a lifetime, working with some of the brightest, caring, and passionate group of people. I learnt a lot and grew leaps and bounds as an engineering leader and as a human, all because of the people I got to work with. I will miss working with them dearly. üôè I am now looking forward to the next adventure in my career. Hopefully a place where I can make an impact, utilize my skills to help and grow others, and in turn grow as a leader. #opentowork #lovewhereyouworked #layoffs

I joined #lyft earlier this year and fell in love with a fantastic team of brilliant, hardworking, and compassionate people. Unfortunately my role, along with those of some fellow colleagues and others in the tech industry, have been impacted by companywide layoffs. While I‚Äôm sad to leave, I am so grateful to my Lyft family and so proud of what we accomplished together. Thank you to everyone who reached out with words of encouragement, concern, and support. If you know of an opening in Legal, I‚Äôd love to chat! And if you‚Äôre hiring across different functions, consider this list of incredible and talented Lyft alumni: https://lnkd.in/grG3g5GS #lyft #layoffs¬†#opentowork

This is a great listen, and very timely. Many of us out there will be able to relate to his story. I remember calling my dad in tears when I first got laid off, and him telling me it was a great thing as it would force me to go on to do something even better, a few weeks later I was on a plane to Dubai (and stayed there for 12 years!) Thanks, Josh Bersin üëèüëè

This is a really nice initiative. Nothing like having to move because you only get 60 days in a slowing economy with layoffs and hiring freezes to find another job, or drop everything and move out of the country. These people need your help.

Hello network - here is a group of 7 scientists/economists/BIEs that are some of the best start up talent you can find and are available to work. If you are hiring or know of someone who is hiring, do make introductions and send referrals (feel free to DM me). Do not let this golden opportunity of hiring incredible science talent go by. Yes, recently LinkedIn has been full of unfortunate news of layoffs. And yes, this feels like yet another post. However, this group of rockstar scientists are on a visa and hence on an immigration clock. And are tried and tested strong talent. Every day matters. Please do your best. Any organization would be lucky to have them. Make our loss your talent gain.

As Bloomberg News points out, this is devastatingly awful leadership, not just on Elon Musk but also on the entire board and leadership of Twitter in the buy-out negotiations. We need a new way for tech C-suite and Founders; because clearly this isn't working.  "Twitter Inc., after laying off roughly half the company on Friday following Elon Musk‚Äôs $44 billion acquisition, is now reaching out to dozens of employees who lost their jobs and asking them to return.Some of those who are being asked to return were laid off by mistake, according to two people familiar with the moves. Others were let go before management realized that their work and experience may be necessary to build the new features Musk envisions, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.... The requests for employees to return demonstrate how rushed and chaotic the process was."#twitter #leadership #startups #hiring #layoffs

I hope everybody remembers that Meta hired a huge amount of people when the company wanted to put emphasis on virtual reality and changed its name from Facebook to Meta. Layoffs with very short notice after massive hires are a reality of the US labor market that is devastating and wasteful and seems to denote mediocre management and strategy habits. I've been pointing this out to anybody who is willing to hear it for years. It seems to be an accepted and normalized practice. I've even heard recruiters say that this flexibility is great because it offers employees the ability to quit overnight, which is both a short-sighted statement and an incredibly absurd fallacy. How can we change this?
-----------------------------
Many think leaving your current org for a F100 solves all problems. That it will give you security. Not necessarily. Staying or leaving a company both require energy -- to manage what is or to create what's next. No matter what the path, doing the work figuring out your values, your career goals, what skills you actually need to get there is your first step. THEN you can assess whether the next big Tech job is for you. #layoffs #lyft #twitterlayoffs #twitter

Danish Majeed, Thank you for this kind post. What your colleagues and friends are experiencing is Job Loss Trauma. Yes, it is a real thing.

Would you take a salary hit to preserve your colleagues' jobs and keep your company or department together?It's layoff season once again.While pundits are saying it's not going to be on the order of what we saw during 2008-09, it's still going to impact many companies.Tech is probably the bellwether, and the article linked below from Business Insider (paywall) summarizes the top tech company layoffs so far this year.But I'm not reading any stories about companies that respond to uncertainty by first tightening _everyone's_ belt so that the entire company can continue to function without the impact of a big layoff.Arguably, the disruption caused by a big layoff has an impact on morale, cohesion, trust, and productivity.  After all, why give it your best when you could be the next head on the block?What if everyone, starting with significant concessions from the C-Suite, chipped in a portion of their salary to cut the company's run rate and cover the projected amount that would have been otherwise saved by a layoff?What about you? Do you believe in our "musical chairs" culture, or would you be willing to make a personal sacrifice to support the team you work with every day?Please share your willingness in the Poll, and share with your colleagues so that we can get a significant sample on what I hope is an important question for many in the workforce.#recession2022 #team #layoffs #culture #workculture #downsizing #twitter #techlayoffs #badbosses #jobloss #careers #jobsearchadvice #jobsearch #corporateculture #csuite #paycheck #hrcommunity #peopleoperations #peoplefirst #humanresources (https://lnkd.in/gRjpeMpP)

It's a shame layoffs became a trend in the tech industry in 2022...One of the few "upsides" is that as with the Covid19 lockdowns, is it raising awareness for workplace stability, work-life balance, the viability of different workplace locations, and of course mental health.For everyone involved it's important to keep pushing and not giving up! üí™Network, get outside (or touch grass as kids say nowadays), and explore all paths.

I want to write something witty and eye-catching about the layoffs that are continuing daily in tech, but I can't. All I can think about is the stress, anxiety, anger, sadness, frustration, resentment, and all the other feelings that every single person laid off must feel. Having that rug pulled out from underneath you is one of the worst feelings in the world, and I want to say I'm sorry this happened to you. Feel those feelings, take a moment and be angry, sad, cry and yell. Take the space to fully feel what is happening because it is unique to you and your situation. #layoffs #mentalhealth

This is my final week at Warner Bros. Discovery/ WarnerMedia. First, I wanted to give a big shout out to the amazing bosses I've had: Emma May, Valerie Immele, and Amanda Comer. Without y'all I never would have become the collaborator and communicator that I am today, nor would I have been able to create some truly amazing marketing and experiential content for our Fans. And here's a huge thank you to Mallom Liggon, MBA - my mentor, ear, collaborator, and friend. To the hundreds of people I've worked with these last 7 years, I truly hope to cross paths with y'all again. We had a blast, didn't we? I will look back on my journey here with pride, and I'm excited to see where the path may lead me next!In closing, here's a pic of Brene' Brown and me after our session at SXSW this year for #vulnerability.

When I joined #Twitter earlier this year, I was excited to join an organization known for strong culture, empathy, and heart. I‚Äôve had the chance to lead an amazing team of User Researchers who are kind, compassionate, and fierce advocates of their users and customers.¬†In my first week in this role, a black swan event (there's always a bird reference) led this company down a very different path. These months have been built in all of us resiliency, focus amidst chaos, and grit.¬†I will be forever grateful that my memories of my last day at Twitter include hearing everyone on my team take time to share what they admire about one another, accentuated with laughter and tears. And working beside my fellow leaders, trying to set up whomever was left over with a roadmap for success. It turns out that our efforts were in vain, as our entire organization was eliminated.¬†To those of you who have so kindly reached out asking how you can help: Please help me identify opportunities for my colleagues and team.

Hello to my network. It's almost like a broken record now, but I was included in a layoff after a sales restructure of EZLease in the beginning of October.

I have met and known many incredibly talented people who are working in the U.S. on an H-1B visa. It is a great tool for connecting talent to companies and provides opportunities to many amazing people. But H-1B visas are strict, complicated, and the rules can be hard to understand (as someone from the outside looking in). I can't imagine the pressure one would feel being a part of a mass layoff and then having a ticking clock to find your next job in 60 days. If you've ever been through a mass layoff (or 'reduction in force' for those who think it's a better euphemism), you know it can be a difficult experience. Can you imagine adding the pressure of having to find a job in 60 days...or else you have to immediately leave the country, home, friends, and the life you've been building? The visa provides great opportunities to individuals, and we benefit from their economic and cultural contributions. I'm glad to see people banding together to help each other out and I hope the next chapter for these individuals is even better than the last.

I know many of my former colleagues are struggling with mass unprecedented layoffs, but perhaps this‚Äôll help and provide a little encouragement:I‚Äôve been at EZLynx (as part of the Applied Systems family) a little over a year, and I can confidently tell you that it‚Äôs a massive difference from my previous gigs‚Ä¶and for the better! I can easily say and assure you that the grass is 1,000% greener for me now, and the future looks even brighter since I changed companies. This isn‚Äôt to disparage any of my previous employers, they helped me get where I am and suited me well for that period of my career. I‚Äôm just speaking my truth of how much happier I am now with the shift I made. Don‚Äôt be scared of change. The fear of the unknown is understandably terrifying, but what‚Äôs truly more frightening is that fear is probably stifling and hindering your career growth. Don‚Äôt let the guise of being comfortable and stable where you are make you hesitant to take the first step. Evolve, grow, apply elsewhere. You honestly deserve better.

On my 1st #Googleversary, let's have a conversation with Google-Hey Google, why should one choose to work for you?Response- Great #purpose üéØ question Lipsi. Let me give some of the reasons that were important for you. This would help others to choose what could be their driving forces -1. You get to work with the best of minds and collaborative people. It's the people and their effort that builds a place.¬†2. You are given the autonomy to choose the role, team, and pace of your deliverables. The independence to diagnose a problem, identify its complexity, and the areas it affects, and figure it out to ultimately solve it3. We take care of our people and they take care of everything else. Some of the ways we take of our people are --Day 1 green card policy to support the best of international talents-Support their higher education goals financially-Ability to switch focus from work to personal life whenever needed-Acknowledge their presence and effort with words and peer bonus to convey thanks-A community for almost everyone so that they feel they belong here-52*5 days of healthy and fresh meals-24*7 micro kitchens for snacks and beverages-Host visitors who can experience the Google offices that are no less than resorts. Theme parks on each floor and game/music/message/nap rooms -Health support with physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellbeingWOW üíÉ ¬†Hey Google, how can I become part of you?Response - wait for Lipsi‚Äôs post üïí Okay, so far my most valuable support was when I could switch focus from work to handling the personal challenges in life. I am grateful that I get to work on what I want to. Especially at this time when other top tech companies need to learn the employer-employees' relationship goals from the leader in the space on how to treat their people. Because it not only affects employees but also affects their families.#Google#womenintech#relationshipgoals¬†#layoffs

I took time today reflecting on the professional growth that I've had over the last year. My recent job didn't end how I suspected, or how I wanted, but sometimes it is what it is. The folks that I was surrounded by in my position, were the kindest, most encouraging, brightest, fun-having folks. I didn't ever really picture work being something I was going to be excited about everyday, although its what I wanted. The folks I got to work with really highlighted and elevated me, to become a passionate recruiter. Wanting to help, and encourage others to push for new opportunities, growth, or just to help someone have a better day.I was taught that I am a great recruiter. This team pushed me into my specialities, and expertise within technical roles. This gave me the confidence to push further into my career, and fight the imposter syndrome. It was an AWSome experience. (I couldn't help myself)All in all, with many of us on the job search, it made me realize that the greatest thing I could've done, was finding an experience like that, which is tough to do, and just a little bit of luck. Let's all feel positive moving forward, and know that everything will be okay. If anyone affected by layoffs would like to network, ask me questions, or can provide some insight feel free to reach out!#layoffs #recruiting #technicalrecruiting

Love this post Ashley Jablow! I've been calling this the "don't blink" principle during my sabbatical - like I'm having a staring contest with ambiguity and need to be comfortable looking it in the face and accepting it.

Sometimes life works in funny ways. This weekend I received my 1 year anniversary block from #twitter . Unfortunately, Friday was my last day at the company as I was one of many thousands impacted by the 50% #layoffs and am now #openforwork . However, I wanted to take this block‚Äôs arrival as a moment to reflect on my experience working at Twitter.Joining Twitter was a leap of faith for me but it was the best leap of faith I‚Äôve ever taken. Over my time there, I got to be a part of a community where people were incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about what they did, took so much pride in their roles, and always took a moment to teach others and drive understanding. Tweeps are incredibly compassionate and empathetic. I saw that everyday on the capacity planning team where we fought to get our customers what they deserved. I saw it in my work on Twitter Asians where the team constantly worked to build a community where everyone felt they belonged #inclusionanddiversity . Tweeps are also people who want to give everyone an opportunity. If you had an idea, you got to run with it, whether you were a SWE I or a Staff Engineer, it didn‚Äôt matter, everyone‚Äôs ideas were valuable. During my time there, I learned so much and got to work with so many amazing people. Huge thanks to my team and to all the other wonderful folks I worked with who supported me all along the way. #lovewhereyouworked ¬†I also wanted to take a second to express my gratitude to those who reached out to check on me and to the wonderful community of folks across LinkedIn from Twitter, ex-Twitter, and across the industry helping support those impacted by layoffs. Seeing the level of outreach, support, and empathy has been beautiful.As for what‚Äôs in store for the future, I‚Äôm currently looking for roles in Capacity Planning, Data Science, IT Supply Chain, and Product Management. If you‚Äôre looking for a passionate, hard-working, curiosity-driven ex-Tweep, please reach out!To any ex-Tweeps, I also wanted to share this document with ex-Tweep info looking for new jobs circulating to add your name to :) :https://lnkd.in/gmqzrpPq

So, I'm kicking off a series on my blog with stories of past #jobinterviews as a bit of catharsis for job seekers.

Last week I was part of the 12% of brilliant individuals affected by¬†Chime's layoffs.I joined Chime as an RC 1 year ago to start my career in the talent and recruitment world. This was my first role outside of the non profit world- nervous and eager to learn I was fortunate to join a strong team that taught me everything I needed to know about becoming an excellent recruitment coordinator. During my short time at Chime, I supported a incredible group of recruiters and sources; Courtney Clavon and Sarah Brazil, the entire Engineering recriutment team #teamsweep, and the wonderful Chi5 recruiters :). A special thank you to the early talent team for showing me the ropes to the ins and outs of intern hiring!Last but not least, I  am extremely grateful to the RC Team :) You took me under your wings when I was brand new to the coordinator space.  A special thank you to Casey Garrigan & Doug Altman- my partners in interviewer training crime. I will miss our weekly meetings, with the riddles and never ending metaphors. To Mary Costello & Brandi Blossom, thank you for always being there for my never ending questions, especially in the beginning! To Adrianne, Nate and Sarah- thank you for your leadership and never ending support ‚ù§Ô∏è It was great being a part of this team and being a part of Chime.

Hello LinkedIn friends,Like many last week, I was unfortunately impacted by the mass tech layoffs. Last Tuesday, Gem let go of roughly 1/3 of its workforce. It took me a while to post this since it‚Äôs my first major layoff and I‚Äôve spent the last week processing the waves of shock, disappointment, sadness and most importantly, the immense gratitude for my incredible year at Gem.During my interview process, I remember asking my recruiter Karen Ding what were some of her favorite things about Gem, and she immediately said it was a company that truly lives out its values. It was important for me to join a company that instilled integrity and inclusivity into its business practices and culture. Even though I was skeptical at first, from my first week on I knew this was a place that not only talked the talk, but walked the walk.As I‚Äôve told candidates and new joiners countless times since: I‚Äôve never worked at a place where everyone was genuinely kind, supportive and collectively strived to reach goals as a team. It‚Äôs rare to come across this kind of environment and company culture where your voice matters and your lived experiences are valued, where vulnerability and safety are a priority within employees' wellness. And although Gem wasn‚Äôt perfect by any means, I can say with my whole heart that it‚Äôs one of my favorite places to ever work at. I have nothing but respect for the company‚Äôs leaders and will continue to cheer them on from the sidelines.I want to take the time to personally thank my manager Justin Swisher and, more recently, Desiree Caballero for taking a chance on me at a time when I was pivoting into a new career. I‚Äôm forever grateful for your guidance, support and the countless invaluable lessons you‚Äôve taught me throughout my experience.That being said, I am #opentowork and am actively on the market for any roles in #talentbrand (DE&I and Employment Brand) or #recruitingcoordinator roles with a path to talent brand. If you know of any leads, please feel free to contact me!To all of my fellow Gems, past and present ‚Äî thank you for truly the best year of my life. It's been an honor. To all of those who have already reached out to me in support ‚Äî thank you. It warms my heart to know that I have such an incredible support network out there. In the meantime, please also check out and help share the spreadsheet linked below of all of my talented colleagues who were impacted as well. Any company would be truly lucky to nab one of these Gems üíéhttps://lnkd.in/g_6GR4HbFinally, it would be remiss of me not to mention that I am just one of many talented workers who have been affected by layoffs across the industry. If I can be of any help to anyone during this time ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs by way of referral, being a listening ear or even just building community ‚Äî please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out üíô#lovewhereyouworked #layoffs #tech #recruiting

Layoffs. Layoffs everywhere. All the big tech companies are reducing costs and finding ways to trim their staff. It can be so easy to get discouraged - "if all the big companies are doing it, so will mine". It can draw so much of our energy and focus. Additionally, If you've been out of a job for a few months now, you probably feel discouraged with all the new waves of unemployed peers who you feel may have an advantage for having worked at Twitter, Google, Meta or other desirable brand names. You may even feel stuck in an industry that is dying because of your past experiences.So how do you keep positive in a time with so much uncertainty?1) Realize that you are more than your job. Your worth is not tied to your employment status - you are still a worthy human being who deserves patience and grace - not just from others, but especially from yourself. Forgive yourself for the situation you are in - more than likely it is not your fault.2) Realize that some things are out of your control - focus on what you can control instead: Your resume, your job hunt strategy, and your attitude. 3) There are still tons of smaller companies hiring out there - don't focus on the big names that draw the media attention - steer away from trying to target those companies now, and focus your attention on industries that are less likely to fail (healthcare for example). 4) Reach out to your network to see what opportunities there might be that you haven't even thought of. Reach out if you need help with refining your job search strategy - I'd be happy to help. #job #hiring #jobsearch #layoffs #opportunities

Please reach out if you would like to discuss this role or perhaps other future roles in more detail.Best of luck to you all!  #hiring

My feed is full of people impacted by lay-offs and it's not pleasant to watch so many lose their jobs.It is easy for all of us to think that we might be the next ones and that no industry is safe. The latter is true. No job is 100% recession proof and there is not a one way solution to decrease the likelihood of being impacted.However, and this is what you can do to help you land back on your feet in case you are let go:- Prepare during the "good times". Building a network of professionals in your industry can help you should you need a referral.- Update your CV/resume as well as your LinkedIn profile. Make sure recruiters who work for companies that are still hiring can find you. An important thing here is also checking if you allow people to send you messages (InMails).- Outline a strategy for your job search. I know it's tempting to just apply everywhere when you're desperate, and I don't want this to sound tone deaf, but a good strategy will yield the best results.- Be professional with what you post and how you behave. Though you might feel hurt about having the rug pulled from under you, remember that your reputation should remain intact. There is always someone paying attention.This should not be a time for unqualified people to prey on the fears of job seekers but, unfortunately, it is. So don't spend your hard earned money on services that claim you can beat the ATS or that you can get a job without applying if only you take a course! There are plenty of free resources out there from actual Recruiters who just want to help - I'll tag some people that have amazing and FREE resources for job seekers.Let me know what other suggestions you have for job seekers üëá #layoffs #jobmarket #jobseekersupport #recruitment #jobsearchtips #resumetips

TOUGH economic times ahead?  Job losses coming?  Perhaps it's not all gloom and doom if  labour hoarding takes hold.  Find out more about "labour hoarding" by reading my new piece at #PerthNow.Labour hoarding describes a trend in which employers strategically decide to retain staff during a slowdown in order to avoid the costs associated with recruiting new hires when the economy rebounds.Hoarding employees does offer some advantages, despite the need to incur higher payroll costs during tough times.Employees retain their jobs; future recruitment, induction and training costs are minimised; and businesses will be less likely to experience labour shortages when the economy improves.Yet labour hoarding is not suitable for all employers.Businesses that experienced significant challenges restoring or expanding their employee base post-pandemic are likely to make a greater effort to retain their staff should economic conditions deteriorate.And some businesses will be more inclined to choose labour hoarding over lay-offs if they think any economic downturn will be short-lived.#recruitment #redundancies #layoffs #humanresoruces #humanresourcemanagement #management #leadership #jobs #workplace #recession #economy

Excerpt from Stripe layoffs memo:"In making these changes, you might reasonably wonder whether Stripe‚Äôs leadership made some errors of judgment. We‚Äôd go further than that. In our view, we made two very consequential mistakes, and we want to highlight them here since they‚Äôre important:We were much too optimistic about the internet economy‚Äôs near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown.We grew operating costs too quickly. Buoyed by the success we‚Äôre seeing in some of our new product areas, we allowed coordination costs to grow and operational inefficiencies to seep in."Leadership perspective on boom and bust cycles#stripe #layoffs #10xmanager

We're probable entering a nerve wrecking period of layoffs and job uncertainties. While dealing with a job loss is difficult for everyone, that difficulty increases by 10x if you're on a work visa in the US. Why?Because you get only 60 days to find a new job. And if you can't you have to leave the country. And just like that their dreams come to a crash. I've known families who've had their entire lives uprooted because of this. So, if you're someone who's been laid off, while you're looking for a job, I'm sure you also need to be aware of the legalities of your visa as well as what options do you have. We've discussed all this and more in this session with Immigration Lawyer Sonal Sharma.I'm hoping that you find it useful. All the best. We're all rooting for you. #h1bvisa #layoffs #immigrationlawyer https://lnkd.in/e8kAQZNj

We live in a time of uncertainty right now. We are seeing large-scale layoffs left and right. I understand it is a tough time for much of the workforce, especially those affected by redundancies. But don't lose hope, there are better and bigger things for you. There will always be another company that values the work you do, your experience and has a spot for you on their team.Going into this holiday season, don't forget the one thing that will always be there for us as human beings, Family. Make sure you make that time to spend with your loved ones, unwind, and try to forget about everything going on in the workforce, at least for a little bit.#workforce #layoffs #holidays #family #wordsofhope

"I got laid off by Twitter"  The amount of posts I've seen about the Twitter layoffs these past few days is disturbing and it reminds me of how important it is to focus on you and your wellness because it really is the only thing you've got (If you take care of it). If you're someone that's being impacted by these layoffs I want you to know that I am here to support you. The best way to get through uncertain times like these is through support from your friends, family, former colleagues and your THERAPIST!! My clients have all come to me during times of destress and now they're landing their dream jobs, buying their dream homes, starting families they've always wanted and just overall thriving. So, with all the stress and uncertainty lately I have decided to take on a few more one-on-one clients. If you're not feeling like the best version of you then let's fix that. Send me a message if you're interested and we can set up a discovery call to see how I can best help!In the meantime, #Likedinfam if you or anyone you know is hiring then leave it in the comments.

Laid Off Unexpectedly? Do These 5 Things Next.https://lnkd.in/gAaugAmp#layoffs
-----------------------------
It‚Äôs time for me to say goodbye to #DominoDataLab as I, too, was impacted by their #layoffs of 25% of their workforce this morning. This was beyond shocking to me after coming back from a birthday weekend surrounded by loved ones. Being the sole Staff Accountant and AP Lead, I‚Äôve had the pleasure of working w/ every single employee that has ever submitted an expense globally and the finance/revenue teams at all of our vendors. Many have said accountants keep the lights on and are the last to be laid off in a recession. As this is no longer the case, employees who work at startups and pay for business expenses out of pocket w/o a corp. card will be impacted financially by the delays of reimbursements given the staff shortages.I‚Äôll be taking a few days off to spend time with family before returning to seek my next challenge! Those who are hiring or know of open oportunities, I ask that you comment below to help my colleagues and those in my network who has also been laid off during the past few weeks. Let‚Äôs support each other through this hard time!#machinelearning #datascience #accountant #finance #opentowork #womenintech #recruiters #tech #startup #layoff

It breaks my heart to see so many friends and former colleagues get laid off from their jobs recently. I can only imagine how isolating, scary, and shocking it must all be.Whenever I remember feeling impacted by something that felt completely outside of my control, I think of the people who were there for me to help navigate the uncertainty.I'd now like to offer my support for those who need it. Even before I became a professional coach, I was helping people make career and life transitions. Over the last few years, I've gotten the chance to refine that into a skill and craft that I've seen help people transform terrible low moments into life changing pivots.If you are in need of some support, I am providing complimentary coaching sessions over the next few weeks.Please reach out at www.fayzanrab.com/contact if you would like to learn more. I would love to hear your story :)#Lyft #Twitter #Stripe #layoffs

Layoffs. The news is gut-wrenching to everyone. We‚Äôve all been worried job-security at one time or another. Sleepless nights, a pit in the stomach, and unrelenting worry. It‚Äôs awful. As a child, my dad was laid off numerous times. I remember eavesdropping on adult conversations between my parents wondering how they would make ends meet. He was the sole provider for the family, and I was always worried when I saw his car home after 8 a.m. Was it time to worry again? This has forever changed my relationship with the workplace and the people in it. If you can influence how your company carries out layoffs, consider ways that you can reduce the stress and uncertainty the employees and their families face. Consider generous severance packages, outplacement services, and other job placement assistance. Know that the employees not subject to layoff may experience excess stress from the economic news. Be prepared to provide space and time for them to share concerns.There are so many examples of companies getting this right. When you see these examples, share them far and wide. #HR #layoffs #peoplefirst #culture

Why is getting laid off on a H1B visa more difficult?People on H1B visa get 60 days from their last working day to find another job. But how does that really work?Day 0: Got laid offDay 1-15: Refresh your resume, start applying and start interview prep. Any one who has done tech interview prep knows how hard it is to be interview ready in 2 weeks time.Day 15-20: Scheduling interviews - Hopefully you hear back on your applications and are able to get a few interviews scheduled. This step is super hard in normal times, let alone in the frozen job market we are in right now.Day 21 - 40: Give interviews. Most tech companies have 1-2 screening rounds followed by 3-5 onsite rounds. You are lucky if all this gets scheduled and done in 2-3 weeksDay 41 - 45: Get an offer. Most companies need a few days to generate, approve and get a written offer out.Day 46 - 50: Visa Transfer Application: Even if the company is super fast, it still takes their immigration team 3-5 days to gather your documentation, write your petition and apply to USCISDay 51-60: Visa Transfer Processing: Even with premium processing, it can take 5-10 days for your visa approval to come through. Yes, you can join the new company after receipt rather than approval step, but that takes 3-5 days too.This is the most optimistic timeline - It assumes everything works out perfectly. It won't for most. There are delays at every single step that slows one down, most of them beyond the control of the candidate.And on top of all this, most orgs are in a hiring freeze right now.So you see, visa people have almost zero margin to get another job when they get laid off.If you know such impacted people, help them out in any way you can (hire them, refer them, use your network to help their cause by sharing and commenting for visibility, help them prep for interviews etc)#layoffs¬†#h1bvisa¬†#helppeople #getajob #itstaffing #usajobsearch #usrecruitment

It feels very vulnerable to post this, but if it helps even one person, it‚Äôs worth it.I was laid off 3 months ago. On my 5th day back from maternity leave. On my sweet babe‚Äôs 3-month birthday. It hurt. But honestly, I was relieved. At 12 weeks postpartum I wasn‚Äôt ready. My baby wasn‚Äôt sleeping through the night. My body wasn‚Äôt healed. I was still in survival mode.I spent my first 2 days back from #maternityleave catching up on email and projects. I edited content on day 3. It took me at least 2x longer than usual. My mind was still racing through feeding and nap schedules, planning dinner, and counting backward to make sure the 2 loads of laundry finished before bedtime.¬†So, when I entered my virtual 1:1 on day 5 and was laid off with a large portion of the team, my first feeling was‚Ä¶ relief. I logged off, chuckled at the absurdity of the situation, and took my husband aside privately to let him know we just lost our primary income. Then I sat down on the dirty rug, hugged my kids, and immersed myself in the toy train world my creative toddler built.¬†Early in my career, I witnessed a coworker, box perched on her 9-month pregnant belly, walking out in tears after she was laid off. Her image has stuck with me to this day, but I never would‚Äôve imagined I‚Äôd be in a similar situation. The reality is, many of us are.¬†I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to live in #WashingtonState where we have access to life-changing benefits. I was provided 12 weeks of paid leave to bond with my baby after his birth and unemployment which allowed me the time to find a great job. These benefits helped us keep our home, feed our family despite rising costs, and gave me time to adjust to being a mama of 2.¬†Last week my baby boy turned 6 months old. I also organized my workspace for my new job at a company that is determined to positively impact humankind. I feel truly blessed to join such an incredible team and company.This is all to say, wherever you are, it‚Äôs going to be ok. The hurt is real. The loss of income, accomplishment and routine can feel like the end of the world. But if you put in the work, something better is waiting just around the corner.If you‚Äôre a #digitalmarketer looking for your next opportunity, message me. I have a few I‚Äôd like to pass on.#layoffs #gratitude #stronglikemom #newbeginnings

Layoffs are no fun, that's a given. It's been an emotional roller coaster for sure, but I want to address the unexpected side of #layoffs: restoring my faith in humanity and reinforcing my belief that people are inherently good. I am so blown away by the co-workers, friends, acquaintances, former co-workers, leaders and team members that are advocating for me. Truly. Blown. Away.  Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for fighting for me: submitting my resume, sending me jobs, telling your leaders about me and leaving me LinkedIn recommendations, and to those who listened patiently when I was sad and feeling rejected and kindly reminded me how great I am at what I do......thank you all, my heart is full.For all my laid off friends, hang in there. If I can advocate for you, I 100% will! And for those of you who know individuals who have been laid off....it costs nothing but time to offer a referral, a recommendation, a shared post or a kind word. Trust me, it really does matter. #people #kindness #advocates #customersuccess #onboarding #implementation #saas #bekind #thankyou

I'm sorry to see all the daily headlines about layoffs.I had my own experience with this early in the pandemic. In my case, the job I lost was one I had only been at a few weeks. But that didn't make it easy. Because I had spent so long working to get it. I'd been working freelance for awhile, but needed something more permanent. That required months of job searching and interviewing. Then finally...my efforts paid off. I landed a full-time position at a media production company. I was thrilled to finally find something. That was in March 2020. Needless to say, things quickly got crazy. The cities shut down, the entertainment industry shut down, and I was laid off from my new job. There's no good scenario for these things to happen. On one hand, I was glad I didn't have a family to support. And that I wasn't losing a job I had been at for years. But still...working hard to gain an opportunity and then have it taken away is brutal. The things I've found to be the most useful are: ‚óÜ Professional development workshops available online.‚óÜ Learning new skills based on where industries are headed. ‚óÜ Using social media more to network and meet new people.I guess all we can do is position ourselves so we're stronger in the future. (Easier said than done - I know.) I hope all of you who are struggling are finding the support you need.#thecreativelife #professionaldevelopment #socialemedia #layoffs

Reading about all the recent companies announcing layoffs takes me back to 2012. I have not been directly impacted by layoffs in my career. Rather, I spent 3 years (2010 - 2013) researching the phenomenon from a manager's perspective. In 2012, it was my privilege to conduct qualitative interviews with 14 managers - from front-line, to middle management, all the way up to CEO, about their experiences in decision-making, implementation, and managing in the aftermath of downsizing. Much more emotional than I had thought it would be.A majority of the organizational leaders I have spoken with do not desire to be at a future point where layoffs are necessary. This article talks about the mistakes leaders have made that end in this unfortunate parting of ways between an employee and the company.This article also points out the need for empathy. A new theme that emerged from my research, and that I published about in January of 2013 (via my dissertation), was that of treating downsized employees humanely. We need more leaders that are willing to say they made a mistake, learn from their mistakes, and be more empathetic to employees when layoffs are inevitable. #layoffs #downsizing #organizationalchange

My therapist often tells me to sit in my emotions. As a coping mechanism, I developed looking for the silver lining/bright side, which according to her, is actually more of a logical brain response. The problem, we skip the part where we actually process and meditate on our emotions. This exact process is super important for our emotional and mental health, as doing so allows us the opportunity to truly release our feelings and move on. Not doing so can leave us carrying a backpack of feelings that can weigh us down for a lifetime. Right now many of our friends, colleagues, and loved ones are getting #laidoff and 9/10 it's really not their fault. This doesn't even matter because at the end of the day it's a huge blow to the ego and can leave you with feelings of abandonment and worthlessness. So when your friend, colleague, or neighbor tells you they have been laid off, depending on where they're at emotionally, the last thing they need to hear is a logical response from you. On the surface it may seem caring to say things like: "You were at company X, you'll be ok." OR "Well at least you got a good severance package." OR "Good thing you don't have a family." More than likely, they already know the things you're pointing out and often times statements like this can be quite dismissive (regardless of our intentions). Not to mention, we really don't know people's personal situation, so it's really not our place.Instead, try statements/questions that provide, support, comfort, and validation. Things like, "Man, that sucks, how are you feeling?" OR "I am here for you if you want to talk about it (and just LISTEN.) OR "I am really sorry about that, let me know if there is anyway I can support you." I was laid off almost a year ago and can speak from personal experience that supportive messages/calls gave me the space to process my feelings. Sending everyone who has been recently affected by layoffs or still struggling to find a job so much support, love, and healing. #mentalhealth #layoffs #tech #jobsearch

I've planned and participated in 100s of lay-offs and terminations over the years, and let me assure you, there IS a right way to plan conduct a lay-off or terminate an employee from your business. Elon Musk decided to do it the wrong way, and I bet he‚Äôs likely regretting it now. üò´The WRONG way is what happened last week at Twitter. The lay-offs were done more as a PR stunt and power move than with actual purpose. Resulting in a dehumanizing mess with little regard for the individuals who helped build the company and care for its millions of users around the world.    And now, because there was not much strategy or planning, Twitter finds it necessary to ask those same people they just mistreated to come back?  That their core services need support and could they please return to the employer that just treated them like garbage?I have a feeling they won‚Äôt see much of an uptake. The RIGHT way to conduct a termination, in a big or small organization, is to have a plan. Be organized. Think of all the risks and contingencies. And most importantly think about how you can make the exit of a former team member as caring and compassionate as possible. Let‚Äôs be clear, this process is never easy, and it‚Äôs never painless. But if you do it right everyone can walk away from a genuinely negative experience with their head held high and their dignity intact. For goodness sake, do NOT follow Twitter's example!  As the old saying goes "The a** you kick today may be the one you have to kiss tomorrow!" üòò#twitterlayoffs #terminations #layoffs #elonmusktwitter #dignityforall #empathymatters

-----------------------------
My heart goes out to all who are experiencing the mass layoffs in Tech for the first time. In the 90s-early 00s (we called those years Internet 1.0) I faced several rounds of lay-offs, and received a few offers just hours before hiring freezes took effect. It was bananas. Several years before mobile internet and social media- we stayed connected through Friday night rooftop parties during the salad days. When the market tanked in April 2000, we adapted to the change much the same way. Calling them 'Pink Slip Parties' Gen Xers gathered one Friday evening monthly at spots like 330 Ritch in SOMA for informal recruitment. Wearing color coded dots identifying one's objective- we would buy each other drinks in exchange for impromptu interviews, internal job leads, rumors about who/when/where the next round of layoffs would happen. LinkedIn is a far more reliable tool, recruiters are much more accessible and tuned in, and the spirit of helping each other through the rough times has not only lived on- it's flourished. Sending you all virtual hugs. Breathe, spend time serving yourself, keep a regular schedule. Don't despair. It is rough, but it is also temporary. https://lnkd.in/g57WYawk #socialmedia #hiring #linkedin #recruitment #tech #layoffs
-----------------------------
When I asked Recruiters in the past how they got into their line of work, they usually replied, ‚ÄúI fell into it. Something clicked later.‚Äù¬†My mom dabbled in boutique agency recruiting to make ends meet during the 2008 recession.Growing up, the idea of becoming a recruiter seemed appealing because, as a child of immigrants, recruiting seemed like a stepping stone to discovering what companies value for talent.¬†Recruiters are also the people on the ground who translate these strategic objectives into a narrative that gets prospective candidates to explore these newfound opportunities.¬†While there may be many layoffs in big tech companies, once a new strategy has formed, they will return to another round of hiring sprees.¬†The cycle continues.Companies would have found their next ‚Äúbig bet.‚Äù AR/VR, Crypto pivots, and other slingshot projects brought many talented people to Meta. Remember Facebook Pay? That‚Äôs still going.¬†Now, Meta is the next hot topic of massive layoffs.As such, I wonder, ‚ÄúHow can we balance innovation and slingshot projects without dragging the bottom line? R&D should be ongoing and budgeted for, not a last-ditch effort pivot for monetization.‚Äù¬†A company‚Äôs newest innovation cannot be its sole driver for revenue. If you‚Äôre launching a new startup or pivoting your company, diversification of products is crucial because any time the market shifts, it becomes increasingly harder for established companies to find product-market fit. Therefore, large companies cycle through large layoffs and hiring sprees faster than ever.And to the startup folks I know who took a bet on a company that may not have worked out, I see you. Just because your company doesn‚Äôt appear on the top news module on LinkedIn does not mean you should not tell your experience. We want to hear from you all especially.¬†My newest venture is building toward what the Future of Work should look like and how it could be equitable for everyone.¬†We‚Äôd love to hear from everyone where they are in their career journey today.

If you are working on an H-1B Visa, and have been recently laid-off, please read this article by Sophie Alcorn Sophie Alcorn #layoffs

You must receive a written notice 60 days before the date of a mass layoff. If not, you may be able to seek damages for back pay and benefits for up to 60 days. Any company with more than 100 employees have to meet the above WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) Act.Twitter has violated that act, and it is currently being sued for it.So what defines a mass layoff ? Under WARN act if any of the below conditions is met:‚≠ïÔ∏è At least 50 employees are laid off during a 30-day period, if the laid-off employees made up at least 33 % of the workforce; or‚≠ïÔ∏è 500 employees are laid off during a 30-day period, no matter how large the workforce; or‚≠ïÔ∏è An entire work site is closed down and at least 50 employees are laid off during a 30-day periodI think most of the companies prefer to join the big fire now rather than becoming a single smoke later. The news have been speculating about few other companies planning to do layoff this week. The anxiety and stress after hearing about the painful news, may lead you to overlook on some of your own employee rights. I found this article very useful, so sharing it here.Link: https://lnkd.in/e3knNfdQ #layoffs #WARNAct #employeerights #randomtopics

One of the things not always touched on when people talk about layoffs is the heartbreak. It really is akin to a lost relationship when you have to leave a job and a company that you really loved. Not to mention the interview process afterwards can often feel like speed dating, but if the date doesn‚Äôt go well or they ghost you, you may not be able to pay your rent. You have to get out there before your heart may be fully ready to move on. My goal now is to find a place that I can fall in love with all over again.#layoffs #startup #opentowork #opentonewopportunities #opentoconnections #interviewing #hireme #motivationmonday #careergoals  üòä

In CA, certain employers are supposed to give 60 days notice to employees about mass layoffs, relocations or terminations. This is called a WARN notice. WARN notices are updated every week by CA EDD. They of course don't make it easy to find the notices because being forced to bootlick industry at the expense of employees is the full-time occupation of most government high officials. In any case you can download the latest WARN reports here: https://lnkd.in/grGqVewCClick on "Getting Started" and then scroll all the way to the bottom.Needless to say there are all kinds of loopholes available to employers to not give notice!#layoffs

The tech layoff headlines are leaving out a lot about the economy and state of the workforce.Despite alarming news about drastic cuts at Twitter and Meta this week, the data paints a very different picture.10.5 million jobs are currently open (BLS), and the current overall layoff rate of .9% is historically low. Why?One reason could be "labor hoarding."The talent war of the last two years has prompted employers to rethink traditional hiring and layoff practices, and many companies are reluctant to let go of their hard-won talent. Demographic forces also predict that the labor market will remain tight, as baby boomers retire and the workforce participation rate sinks lower.¬†For more on why American workers may remain in a strong position despite the current economic turmoil, check out this great article by Jeanna Smialek and Sydney Ember:#hiring #jobmarket #tech #layoffs #laborhttps://lnkd.in/gxxhPitf

Learning how to let go of the past is crucial to our daily lives because it impacts our present and future #happiness.

I hope that this can help provide a framework to help others. Exceptional Futures

Here's a few tough questions that's worth asking yourself during any kind of #jobhunting.‚ùå Before defining the job titles‚ùå Before optimizing your LinkedIn profile‚ùå Before updating your resume‚ùå Before networking and interviewingQuestions like:ü§î What's important to me?ü§î What am I willing to change about myself?ü§î Am I actually happy where I am?In the context of recent #layoffs across different companies, it's more valuable than ever to get answers to these questions for yourself.After all in your career, the only person that should matter is yourself.#careerdevelopment #employment #careerchange

The combination of high interest rates and low labor supply will impact how folks move around technology companies for the next few years prove yet again that that cash is "King".For the last few years, due to the labor shortage no company was in a great position to grow even when they could afford to. As we enter the recession the labour supply looks to be increasing. While tragic, layoffs at large bloated technology companies creates opportunities for smaller firms to pickup incredible talent.Those smaller firms will only be able to grow if they have cash on hand. Interest rates are too high to borrow money and expect decent short term returns. Companies who grew over the last few years due to the incredible flow of venture capital will not be in a great position to grow in the recession as they have little real revenue and a fixed amount of cash.#interestrates #employees #jobchange #hiring #layoffs

If you‚Äôve been affected by the current layoffs, I see you, I feel for you. Given the situation it‚Äôs important to take a moment and process what happened, and grieve the loss. Loss is painful.If you find yourself in any stage of the grieving process, denial, anger, bargaining, depression or acceptance it‚Äôs important to embrace it and give yourself the opportunity to work through it. If you need support to do this there are people providing this level of support. Your current employer might be proving this type of support as well.It‚Äôs not easy to go through a lay off. As I'm writing this, I‚Äôm also going to be the voice that invites you to look at this challenge as an opportunity.When one door closes another one opens. Given the situation you‚Äôre in, it‚Äôs a great opportunity to create something new for yourself and move towards your next level.¬†¬†If you feel that what you had was the best you could do, I want to be that voice that tells you there is a next level for you and to move towards that despite the fear, worry and doubt that‚Äôs coming up.¬†Once you acknowledge the loss of your, job I'm gonna challenge you to ask yourself the following questions:¬†What if, this challenge is my stepping stone to move towards where I truly would like to be?What if this was a push from the universe telling me that it‚Äôs time to amplify certain areas of my life? Am I ready to do it?Given you¬†answered the above questions, what‚Äôs coming up for you? What are you feeling? How does¬†getting to the next level feel for you?Taking a moment to identify what this is for you is key, so that you can start moving towards it despite fear, worry and doubt.¬†The truth is that most of us want to level up in one way or another, so let this be the time to do so. Sometimes we're put in situations, so we can break through the old and move towards where we truly are meant to be.I‚Äôm not saying the process of creating opportunity is easy, and that you won‚Äôt be met with challenges, temporary defeat, and setbacks.¬†What I‚Äôm saying is that if you decide to see it as an opportunity you might be surprised of your outcome of where you'll end up, and as you do make the best of the process.To Your Success,Dragana#challenge #layoffs #opportunity #growthmindset #business #transformation #leadership

How does anxiety affect how we vote? An insightful quote from CNN's John King about how the way Americans feel will affect tomorrow's Election Day spurred me to dive into some research. Noting that 51% of likely voters say the economy and inflation are the strongest influences on their congressional vote, King says "The American people are exhausted. After COVID... you're still exhausted, you're anxious, you're worried about your kids, your job, your healthcare. Joe Biden got elected because he was the adult who was going to calm things down. And things aren't calm." It's a great interview from the podcast On with Kara Swisher and Nayeema Raza.On Election eve, it's hard not to feel irritable, scared, and fed up with the headlines right now. Besides "headline anxiety" and the very real stress that the election itself puts upon us, anxiety affects how we vote. For years, it seems political scientists believed that "anxious voters interrupt their habitual behavior and engage in more effortful information processing," and rely more on research and education than habit or political affiliation to choose their candidates. That's good, right? Anxiety makes me seek out information about policies, and I'll vote based on issues.But: Newer work posits that our emotions drive candidate choice in a more intuitive fashion. If we hear or see a candidate who makes us feel anxious, we're more likely to feel negative about that candidate. Alternatively, if we feel negative about a candidate, seeing that candidate will make us feel anxious! Either way, we're not voting for that candidate. As always, there's a slippery slope in making anxiety work for you and work against you. H. Stephen Moffic writes in Psychiatric Times that "Anxiety is an essential emotion that can help us assess and respond to future risks to our safety and security, a basic human psychological need as Maslow has taught us.¬†However, to use anxiety successfully, people need to be able to assess risks rationally. Although the future is unknowable, educated estimates can still be made‚Äîif there are accurate information and facts."When we're¬†very anxious, it's harder for us to be rational. It might be harder to judge the validity of the information you have at hand. But just enough anxiety about the country's future and our own wellbeing might motivate voter participation. Moffat suggests the ideal is for voters to feel "the sweet spot of anxiety: enlightened participation, voting, realistic hope, and improved mental well-being."I don't think I'm feeling that sweet spot. Are you?Citations:https://lnkd.in/eBrcHuR4https://lnkd.in/eeGEKGeBhttps://lnkd.in/ecf_Yxzh#elections2022 #midterms2022 #midterms #anxiety #mentalhealth #wellbeing #economy #elections #healthcare #future #security #work #layoffs #litrendingtopics

A MAJOR HOUSING MARKET CRASH IS LOOMING IN 2023! Wells Fargo Braces For More Layoffs As Loan Volumes Collapse 90% YOYWells Fargo mortgage staff brace for layoffs as U.S. loan volumes collapseKEY POINTS:- Mortgage volumes at Wells Fargo slowed further in recent weeks, leaving some workers idle and sparking concerns that the lender will need to cut more employees as the U.S. housing slump deepens.- The bank had about 18,000 loans in its retail origination pipeline in the early weeks of the fourth quarter, according to people with knowledge of the company‚Äôs figures. That is down as much as 90% from a year earlier, when the Covid pandemic-fueled housing boom was in full swing, said the people.- Employees are on edge after the bank began cutting workers in April and internal projections point to more departures.https://lnkd.in/e75CJpKQhttps://lnkd.in/eATzTSXrhttps://lnkd.in/eaqkqAhN #business #markets #realestate #housing #economy #economics #finance #money #moneywise #housingcrash #housingcrisis #layoffs #banks #life #future #loans #mortgages #collapse #interestrates #fed #federalreserve #centralbanks #inflation #cpi #data #supplychains #mortgage #covid #people #homebuyers #homes

There will be more of such development from the new CEO, then soon enough it will become a general trend as well. This is one of the major reasons I became a Business Service System Creator and Owner. I knew there will always be disadvantaged people out there who need the services that my baby, my 12 services agency, my Integrated Business Service System (IBSS) can offer. And generally, the 21st century world is more a world of strategic communication and collaboration than commerce and industry. It's all part of my timeless vision for the nascent agency. #twitter #layoffs #joblosses #newcareerpaths #businessservice #systems #vision #entrepreneurship
