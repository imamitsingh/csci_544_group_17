Today marks the birth of Guru Nanak. A prophet and founder of Sikhism who taught to strive for social justice for benefit and prosperity for all and challenged lot of existing practices that were not in support of women equality 550 years ago! The three teachings for lifelong practice for anyone to adapt: 1. Share & Consume (Vand Chakhkho)- Share with others, help those who are in need2. Work Honestly (Kirat Karo) - Earn an honest living, without exploitation or fraud3. Meditate (Naam Jappo) - Take care of your soul. On this day, I hope to inspire others with Guru's teachings to rekindle the light within! Happy Gurpurab! #share #help #gurunanakjayanti #womenequality More info: https://lnkd.in/eTEgd8Ve

Gender equality - a far-fetched dream?It’s not an exaggeration when I say the above statement is absolutely true!While on the one hand, it is heartening to see progress being made across industries and sectors with respect to women empowerment, it is disappointing to see that we cannot even guarantee safe spaces for our women workforce!According to a gender snapshot report by WHO it will take,- 286 years to remove discriminatory laws and gaps in legal protections for women and girls.- 1 in 10 women and girls aged 15-49 were subjected to sexual and/or physical violence by an intimate partner.- 140 years for women to achieve equal representation in leadership positions in the workplace! This, despite toiling day in and day out, equally or even more than their male counterparts! At this rate, gender equality would definitely take hundreds of years to achieve!How can we speed up this process? Let’s discuss in the comments below.#womenempowerment #womenequality P.S.: The link to the report is in the first comment, if someone is interested to take a look.

What an incredible experience to help this amazing association, it is not only a working experience, but a real human experience and a big wakeup call on what is happening and how, at my scale, I can help. Ensemble Sawa is an ONG based in Switzerland aiming to help women in Chad by creating washable sanitary napkins, distributing them for free and raising awareness during workshops in schools and neighborhood centers to abolish taboos and non-understanding of what are the menstrual cycles and the diseases referring to them. Indeed, de-schooling of young women due to mockery because of their periods is a reality.  They have been heard, the premises for the production are now rented and the first sewing machines purchased! We met the Chad Embassy in Switzerland, discussed with the France Embassy and the Swiss Cooperation in Chad and now Ensemble Sawa is ready to start its actions. Congratulations to this incredible association who started from a commitment from its president, Hadjenana Mahamat Abouna, to her dad saying that ONE DAY she will be able to help women of her country by offering them what should be considered as a basic access for women. Get more information about Ensemble Sawa through the below interview or on ensemblesawa.ch  #womenequality #equalityforall #notaboo #swissassociation  Interview credit – RTS Forum 7.2.2022

Gender inequality is one of the structural issues that lay beneath the social institutions that we are built on.However, for the revival of our society and for sustainable development, gender inequality should be weeded out!The world has made significant strides in this sphere in recent decades, but we still have a long way to go. People in their fight for equality lose out on equity and so the ultimate goal here is to Treat every man and every woman as a human 🙌🏻Video credits: @who#wemustdobetterandwewill#genderequality #nodiscrimination #womensupportingwomen #womenempowerment #womenequality #equity #sdg #sustainable #sustainability #unitednations #stellamariscollege #smsd #smsdsh

Let me just put it out here,So i am open to work and applied in some companies currently. Two days back i received a call from an HR to just know more about me and my work profile. All went quite good and cleared 1st round too and told further that we are scheduling the final interview for you. But she added , Just one last question “Are you married or looking forward to extend your family currently?As currently we not hiring them as this sales role will be tough further on”. Building an organisation where abilities are pre judged before hiring?I dont have any comment to give here. Just recently went through a really thoughtful conversations on youtube between Shantanu Deshpande  and Vineeta Singh on The BarberShop with Shantanu and understood how difficult it is always for a women to stand up for their rights still in this times too.I dont want to say i am grateful for companies giving period leaves or treating men and women equally. Like seriously now do we have to appreciate where our BASIC RIGHTS ARE GIVEN?Podcast was relatable to so much extend.  Gone through phases where in business meetings men giving opinion are more valued or listened.Questions like this are not to be tolerated and i am 100% sure my answer to this was the reason i didnt got that offer but not encouraging anyday such questions. Because I remember not standing up in my teenage days for many times and still carrying that guilt “i wish i could have taken stand”.#awarenessmatters #equalopportunities #womenequality #thought

Almost every organization is laser-focused on equality in the workplace. But do we really practice it at our homes??Today is Karwa Chauth in India, a festival where the wife keeps a fast (in the majority parts of the country you don't even drink water) for her husband praying for his health and long life. The fast is broken after seeing the moon in the night sky (which is mostly visible later than on other days).There is an old mythical forklore of a lady who revived her husband from the hands of death by fasting and praying to Lord Shiva and since then it is celebrated as a festival in India every year. I have seen my mother do it every year for the past 36 years.This is my third year of keeping the fast (mind you without water 🙂 ) with my wife. I insisted since the first Karwa Chauth post our marriage that both of us will keep it every year. Not because of any ritual or tale that I believe but if she is so committed to our relationship that she is ready to fast a whole day without food and water, why shouldn't I do it together with her? And I am surprised every year by how people react to it, as a matter of fact when my wife told my mother-in-law today that like every year he has also kept it, she is like please ask him to take care of himself and gave me a lot of blessings. On the other hand, her daughter (my wife) is expected to keep the fast as a norm, hadn't she kept the fast it would have been an issue. But her keeping it is normal. We need to practice equality not just in the workplace but at our homes as well and break through the norms. I am not saying that every husband starts fasting but this is just one instance of equality going for a toss in the name of rituals and norms.#people #india #health #equality #equalityanddiversity #norm #womenempowerment #womenequality

This is a coat hangar. 50 years ago, prior to Roe, this is what women used to use to abort unwanted, life endangering pregnancies. In 2022, when my newsfeed is filled with aspirations of humans colonizing #mars , or #metaverse, here in the US, this is what women in our country will be using again to avoid forced birth. So before you choose to scroll on, choose to stand up for the rights of women in your life. Stand up for your daughter, your wife, your co-worker. Stand up for their rights. VOTE. Woman. Life. Freedom. #womenequality #vote2022 #freedom

“Achieving as much as possible in the first 10 years of a career can cause burnout and stress for women as they focus on producing good work, building a good reputation and advancing to leadership roles,” - BBC News The race to leadership for women is real, especially in male dominated industries.

While Sheryl Sandberg’s book, 𝙇𝙀𝘼𝙉 𝙄𝙉: 𝙒𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙣, 𝙒𝙤𝙧𝙠 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙒𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙩𝙤 𝙇𝙚𝙖𝙙, speaks largely to female executives in the corporate world, the Women’s Growth Collab thinks her messages resonate with women business owners as well.Three (of many!) points she makes in the book are:1. Professional female ambition is not always seen as a compliment in western culture; aggressive and hard-charging women violate unwritten rules about acceptable social conduct.2. Many women feel fraudulent when praised for their accomplishments.  They feel undeserving and guilty…the imposter syndrome.3. Make your partner a real partner. By equally sharing family and personal responsibilities, women can feel more freedom to soar in their work.We salute the messages in this book - more women, more voice, more equality.#womeninbusiness #womenequality #equalitycantwait #leanin

Between 1347 and 1352, some 100 million people died of the Black Plague, representing almost half of Europe’s population. It just so happens, this coincided with the European “witchcraft craze”, in which tens of thousands of women were accused of witchcraft and murdered. The most likely targets were often older cat-owning peasant women (the “Crazy Cat Ladies” of their time) who were labeled “witches” and burned alive at the stake, often along with their furry friends.Multiple researches point to this mass extermination of cats as a pivotal factor in the transmission of the plague.This medieval femicide frenzy did not just take the lives of community wise-women, nurses, and midwives, thus obliterating the feminine wisdom they held, it also decimated the population of Europe.My takeaway from this is that it is not only women who pay the price for primitive, blind oppression. All of society pays a price for lashing out against female wisdom.Sources: Britannica, Smithsonian Magazine, Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez#halloween #witches #womenforwomen #crazycatladies #spookyseason #negotiation #negotiatress #womenequality #witchcraft

Here are 5 stats that tell the truth about women and money. 📊 These statistics were true for 2020, but not much has changed since.👉🏾 Wealth disparities start very early in life: Parents pay kids identified as boys twice as much allowance as they do their kids identified as girls. https://lnkd.in/dpCSGkR8👉🏾 And it continues in the culture: 65% of financial articles aimed at women told them that they are “excessive spenders.” They encouraged women to find bargains and coupons and control splurges. Articles aimed at men told them to dare to invest and spend to increase their power. https://lnkd.in/dPThx7Dv👉🏾 Single women pay more for mortgage loans and are denied them more frequently than single men or couples. Single women borrowers are more likely to be people of color. https://lnkd.in/ezW2DhX👉🏾 Women make up 57% of all higher education students, but they hold nearly two-thirds of the debt across all educational levels. Black women graduate with the most debt: $30,400, compared to $22,000 for white women and $19,500 for white men. https://lnkd.in/dtHKwNn9👉🏾 Five times more women than men live paycheck to paycheck, without an emergency fund. https://lnkd.in/dDBswBrH🤔 What do you think?

Among all numerous different discrimination cases arround the world, we should be aware that the female is the largest group worldwide being discriminated. Only because it is common, state of the art and maybe in some countries not so visible, it shouldnˋt be neglacted nor accepted. The female situation in countries like Afghanistan or Iran could be described, in my personal opinion, as modern slavery. Today, I am deeply grateful to live in one direct-democratic country and would like to take a moment to express my support for these women which are less lucky than myself and do not have freedom of choice to be, nor freedom of choice how to live. #standwithiranianwomen #womeninmint #womenequality #womeninstem

As we were walking down the road.We started talking about Cannaught place in general, how there is so much problem of parking space there and all.One of my colleagues said that she wants to roam around Connaught Place in the night time.And in all the foolishness I asked her : So What's Stopping You? I have come here a lot especially at night.She Told me That I am lucky that I am a man because women have to look for a man to accompany them if they want to go out at night!"Women need men to protect themselves from other men!"After she said these lines I had nothing to say! These were one of those moments when I had nothing to say I was shocked and sad due to the underlying misery of the situation.Many people talk about Women empowerment but how can we empower women when they even cannot go outside at there own will!#womenempowement #womensafety #navratri2022 #womenequality

During GHC, I attended a session that talked about the importance of bringing other woman to the table with you. I immediately thought about my colleagues Michelle & Pam. When I started my journey at LinkedIn I was pretty depleted from past workplace traumas but I was determined not to bring that baggage into my new role at LinkedIn. Michelle and Pam where the first women in my professional career to advocate for me and to keep my name apart of the conversation when I wasn't in the (virtual) room. I can honestly say that they both played an instrumental part in boosting my self confidence and pushing me out of my comfort zones. Cheers to all the women who aren't afraid to help build up other women and bring them to the table. #GHC2022 #womenequality #womenintech #bridgethegap

amazing to learn about Harlem being a  pioneer in #womenequality and in breaking the glass ceiling, opening opportunities for talented doctors as Dr. May Edward Chinn to exercise her profession and dedication to the community.  Harlem Hospital  was the only institution that allowed Dr. May Edward to complete her internship. In order to provide access to care to black Americans and other underserved groups, Dr. May Edward established her own practice and performed  procedures for her patients at their homes. It would take over 10 years and thanks to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia's push for integration, to grant  Dr. May Edward admitting privileges to Harlem Hospital. (Let that sink in for a minute!!) . Under CEO, Georges Leconte and his commitment,  this remains the focal point of the organization! History and DEI matters!!! #healthequity #community #womenempowerment #diversityequityinclusion

There has been a clear lack of media coverage, specifically in the western media world, on the protests and violent acts against women in Iran since the death of Mahsa Amini. These protests have been going on now for weeks and women, incredibly brave women, many children and teenagers, are putting their lives on the line to fight for their freedom. The people of Iran have been cut off from social media and currently have limited access to the internet. That makes US (aka the rest of the world) their megaphone. If you are unaware of what’s happening in Iran, become aware. So, if you need a catch up, here’s a good place to start…And once you’re in the know, don’t stay quiet. There is power in posts, likes, views and saves. So share, share, share.https://lnkd.in/ge7d3Wpv #womenempowerement #iranprotests2022 #iranianwomen #womenequality

To all the people in my network, please consider joining this movement on October 1st from anywhere you are in the world. The time has come to demand women equality once forever, respect human rights, and this time be the voice of women and gender diverse people in Iran.  This movement is NOT about being disrespectful to religious dress codes and beliefs. It is about freedom of choice and equality for brave women of Iran and the world. The current oppressor regime of Iran does not respect human rights of the people of Iran. This regime is killing bare-handed innocent people who demand their basic human rights. Join the movement on October 1 from anywhere in the world. Spread the words.  #mahsaamini #humanrights #equality #womenequality #نه_به_جمهورى_اسلامى

We talk about #womenequality when it comes to business - but too often the barriers are due to women's inequality in healthcare that are only allowing us to live, work and thrive at a fraction of our potential - if that!Over this year we've talked about how women's health affects us with some unbelievable stats: * 75% of women have PCOS and are not aware of it.* 1 in 10 women have Endometriosis which takes 8 years to diagnose * Many women leave their jobs due to menopause We're losing talent and potential talent which also affects businesses. Endometriosis alone costs the UK economy £8.2 billion in treatments and surgery. This restriction doesn't start in the workplace, but how we are told that these debilitating conditions are 'normal', how we just 'have to put up with it'. Medical gaslighting, misogyny and We welcomed back MyOva founder Leila Martyn who has started a petition to ensure conditions such as PCOS and Endometriosis, affecting young girls need to be discussed in schools.  By raising awareness, we're empowering young girls and women to advocate for themselves, join communities who can understand, support and inspire, as well as work together to create positive change.Please sign the petition here  https://lnkd.in/e3j3NDr7You can watch our chat here: https://lnkd.in/eBQwDY_6#womenhealthmatters #womeninbusiness #healthcare #business

Yesterday, I was made aware of a very shocking thing - it will take roughly 133 years to achieve equality between men and women. This really puts things in perspective, doesn't it? We need to come together, and work harder than ever to cover this disparity in a shorter time for the betterment of millions of women and girls around the world. I am thankful to the President of Wesleyan College, Meaghan Blight, and Abhishek Gupta for the enlightening workshop on Enhancing Leadership Skills. But the most important thing talked about was #womenequality. Gender inequality is something that affects so many of us, people of all ages and backgrounds. Just like Rome was not built in a day, achieving equality is not something that happens overnight. So let us start today to build a world that we all can flourish in.

The journey continues... 8th presentation of my last book "Che impresa essere donna" in such a wonderful location as Recanati, a Medieval walled city in the Marche region, the birthplace of the greatest Italian poet of the 19th century, Giacomo Leopardi (his most famous poem “L'infinito/The Infinite” was written from a solitary hill of this town). The book focuses on the challenges that working women face in terms of work-life balance, career opportunities, unfair treatment at work/harassment/discrimination, equal pay, lack of affordable care for children or relatives. Empirical evidence shows that working women in Italy are dealing with increasingly demanding employers and they remain the primary caregivers and organizers of their households. The study found an unequal distribution of family duties between women and men, and inadequate childcare and eldercare services. #workingwomen #womenempowerment #womenequality #newbook #academicresearch

Yesterday, the Utah Women & Leadership Project, Salt Lake Chamber, and Governor's One Utah Roadmap/Utah Governor's Office of Economic Opportunity created space for 40 women and allies to participate in a strategic discussion on how to move the needle on the gender pay gap in Utah.  Utah ranks last for women's equality for the fifth year and 49th for the women's wage gap. During the forum, the excitement and energy captivated the room at BioHive Utah + Denali Therapeutics as we brainstormed ideas to work collectively as a community to improve the lives of women, families, and the state. #womeninbusiness #womenchangemakers #utahlife #wagegape #siliconslopes #techlakecity #womenequality

This was one of my favorite events while working with the Institute for Women's Health & Leadership. I met so many amazing women all while working with a team of talented women who believed in the Institute's mission. Not only did we support and champion women we also dived into difficult conversations around pay equity, board diversity, and the c-suite. Not only did we present flowers to leaders like Dawn, but we also strategized equitable opportunities all while providing scholarships to women attending medical school.This experience was transformative and I'm so thankful to have been a part of it.#leadership #team #health #womenequality #diversityandinclusion #drexeluniversity

As Arundhati Roy says  “There's really no such thing as the 'voiceless'. There are only the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard.”The Iranian women’s fight for freedom is more than a century long struggle. From domestic mysogony to systematic oppression standing for their rights from home to their cities .Hundreds of known and anonymous women activist have sacrificed their life and career and many are currently in prison for activism due to unveiling .Enough is Enough..“Woman , Life , Freedom” is the slogan of the new movement .Last week, the Morality Policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran arrested a 22 year old woman, Mahsa Amini, for non-compliance of her hijab. She was beaten to death in custody. A day later, hundreds of thousands of Iranian men and women poured into the streets all over Iran to protest over Mahsa’s death, police brutality against women, and compulsory hijab. The government has responded with violence and now thousands are fighting across the country .  "This is probably the first time in recent memory that people have come to street in masses in demand of a very clear issue of women's rights”“until women are free none of us are free .. “#mahsaamini #womenequality #humanrights #freeiran

It should be international women’s day everyday, right!? Thought it would be great if everyone could take a moment and stop and thank those women on your team or in your life who show up to work every day and work harder than anyone else despite all odds against them. Women need more than just one day, we need recognition all year as any other person would expect! Thank you to all the women who have either worked beside me, above me, or below me. You have all made a difference in my life.👏👏👏#equalrightsarehumanrights #womenequality #corporate #womeninamerica #employeerecognition #genderequality

Between 1347 and 1352, some 100 million people died of the Black Plague, representing almost half of Europe’s population. It just so happens, this coincided with the European “witchcraft craze”, in which tens of thousands of women were accused of witchcraft and murdered. The most likely targets were often older cat-owning peasant women (the “Crazy Cat Ladies” of their time) who were labeled “witches” and burned alive at the stake, often along with their furry friends.Multiple researches point to this mass extermination of cats as a pivotal factor in the transmission of the plague.This medieval femicide frenzy did not just take the lives of community wise-women, nurses, and midwives, thus obliterating the feminine wisdom they held, it also decimated the population of Europe.My takeaway from this is that it is not only women who pay the price for primitive, blind oppression. All of society pays a price for lashing out against female wisdom.Sources: Britannica, Smithsonian Magazine, Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez#halloween #witches #womenforwomen #crazycatladies #spookyseason #negotiation #negotiatress #womenequality #witchcraft

Menopausal women are the fastest-growing demographic in the workplace!!!Along with my own role at TCS as a consultant, being a single mother,  chair of Uno Parenting and Workplace Parents at #tataconsultancyservices these initiatives are essential in supporting, educating others and ultimately keeping this workforce!!!However, many of these women may be struggling to manage the psychological and physiological changes their bodies are going through.A quarter of menopausal women will experience debilitating symptoms – from hot flushes and night sweats to increased anxiety to brain fog – and for some it forces them out of the workplace completely.This means that experienced middle-aged women are leaving the workforce in droves. These women are likely to be at the top of their game, but without the right support, at the right time, they are unable to reach their full potential for businesses to reap the benefits from. We need to protect this talent.At #tataconsultancyservices women can be assured that they will be supported. #talent #experience #womeninbusiness #womenexecutives #womenequality #diversityandinclusion #menopauseawareness #menopauseintheworkplace #tcs #tcsempowers #inclusiveworkplaces #womenentrepreneurship

It is Our duty to prevent Women from Sexual harassment and Gender bias and take care of our work culture, creating a secure and safe environment and most importantly to Respect them.Happy to complete such an insightful course and learning about women rights and corporate behaviour and nice to hear  about Women empowerment in recent times.Women have made some amazing progress. From World War 1 onwards, women's business history has developed emphatically. Women have advanced in managing and taking fundamental choices and procuring assets for their families.The percentage of working women in India has evolved greatly. Grant Thornton Women in Business Report 2021 survey says that the ratio of women in senior management in India was 39%, compared to 31% globally. Over 98% of Indian enterprises have at least one woman in senior management, compared to 90% globally. In fact, women now lead 47% of mid-market companies in India, compared to 26%  internationally, according to the firm.It is empowering to see that India is beating its companions all around, encouraging a gender equality  culture.In fact, according to a 2019 S&P Global Markets Intelligence Study, companies with female CEOs and CFOs outperformed their peers in terms of stock price performance.#womenempowerment #womenempoweringwomen #womeninbusiness #womanownedbusiness #womenequality

This is to all young girls who are entering the world of startup & corporate. There will be moments you will want to speak in a meeting & someone will speak over you, stop...breathe and then tell them..."excuse me I have not completed my sentence, I'd like to complete it & then hand over the opportunity to you to speak" this is one of the first things I started practising once I realised that if I won't create the culture someone somewhere will create it for me. Don't settle! I'm still nervous today but I do it anyway.It is intimidating as f**! But it's always better than going home & thinking wtf is happening. Why the fuck people don't understand? Could I have done any better?Nothing shatters self-confidence as bad culture & toxic people around you. Stand up for yourself with empathy first towards yourself & then others. Sometimes others might not know better but if you do please take the opportunity to realign. It's worth it. For yourself, others & org!The last is to practise empowering & enable if you find someone else in that position & unable to assert themselves. We must pass on the love & care we received and if not then a good time to be the pioneer to start the chain of giving back. Gratitude & giving back goes a long way ❤#culturefirst #empathy #workplacerelations #meetings #hybridwork #remote #startup #womenequality #womenintech

Swiss misogyny is no news but I could not believe my eyes as I looked for any reasonable argument to why the Swiss parliament is proposing to increase the retirement age of women as a measure to finance the pension gap. Women have a lifelong salary gap of 11-18% in this country already. We now earn 30% less when retired. And yet, no less than two thirds of Swiss Parliament members voted in favor of "harmonizing retirement age", including female members, because "women nowadays are better trained than in the past, most of them work, and they live longer than men". What a nerve.I vote NO, and will look to the referendum's outcome on Sept 25th as a measure of how much women support women in my country. We have such a long, long way to go on the equality front.#genderequality#womenequality#womensupportingwomen

When Pine City-native Marilee Johnson joined the University of Minnesota marching band in 1972, she was issued a men’s uniform with a size 46-inch waist.  Thankfully, she knew how to sew. 🧵✂️Hard to believe it was just 50 years ago that women were accepted into the U's marching band, an institution that now prides itself on equal representation.  🎤🎸🎹🎵🎶🎛🥁This was thanks to the tenacity and boldness of Johnson and a "fight" she put up with a few other women who also saw the ridiculousness of the program's exclusionary practices. 💪🏈 This Friday and Saturday, at a panel and during the halftime of the Gopher football game, respectively, there'll be some much-deserved recognition for this Pine City legend, now 80. 👵📰 See the story in today's Star Tribune:https://lnkd.in/gUrTe39T#university #universityofminnesota #marchingband #womeninmusic #womenequality #football #pinecity #minnesota #uofm #legends #activism #fightforwhatcounts

“The vast majority of the women we interviewed (33 out of 36) raised confidence (or lack thereof) as a central factor obstructing their own and other women’s career progression. For example, one female interviewee castigated herself for failing to negotiate a substantial pay increase to meet the level paid to a male colleague, saying: “I should have had more confidence in myself to push for more.” Another female leader said: “If a job has 10 attributes and a woman has nine, she won’t put herself forward, even while the man has four. I want to do anything I can do [as a leader] to help women with their confidence, to back themselves, and to put themselves forward.”” #job #career #help #leader #womanempowerment #womenexecutives #womenbusinessleaders #womenequality

As the Federal Reserve begins their November meeting, investors will anxiously await the decision from the Federal Reserve about how much the Fed Funds Rate will be increased.In September, the Federal Reserve released their quarterly Dot Plot which illustrates where they see interest rates 1 year out and longer. Here is a short video to help make sense of the Dot Plot. Inflation is difficult, but understanding the long-term objective is important.

Your Daughters and Granddaughters Will Thank You. #leadership Chris Bellinger thank you. 🙏🏼 “ As the father of an amazingly talented and driven daughter, this project has meant the world to be able to show her what women across the world are able to dream and accomplish and to play a small part in showcasing and celebrating those accomplishments. “ Women are equally capable and desert the same opportunities. The fact that I had to build two startups, bootstrapped for lacking funding,  while having the education and work experience to successfully execute on these ideas, it is what we women and minorities are confronted with as entrepreneurs. I am in business to create great jobs to individuals and their families. I am also rising to lift many. #womenequality #womenentrepreneur #equalitymatters #equalitycantwait

Thank you to The Daily Herald of Everett for highlighting Dr Mason.  We, women physicians, owe much to so many of the "first woman physician" of all specialties, in all clinics, and all hospitals, and many more corners of health care and medical education for laying the foundation for generations of women physicians that have followed.  And the work we must do to achieve equity and equality in medicine is faaar from over.  We and many "first woman physician" also need and rely on our male #allies.  My most prominent and strongest allies have been and are men.  They're mostly who are in the roles who help us break glass ceilings, bamboo ceilings etc.  They're the ones who hired Dr Mason.  Thank you, Dr Mason.#womenequality #womenchangemakers #womenempoweringwomen Everett Clinic’s first woman physician, Lucy Mason, dies at 92By Eric Schucht and Jacqueline AllisonWednesday, Aug 31, 2022Mason began her career at a time when being a medical doctor was almost exclusively a man’s profession.EVERETT — In 1924, The Everett Clinic was founded by four physicians. All men. It would be another 35 years until the clinic hired a woman as a physician. Her name was Lucille “Lucy” (Winkler) Mason.Mason started work at the clinic in 1959. She recalled how many of her older male colleagues at the time were skeptical of her ability.“Perhaps in the beginning they looked on me as a mascot that would be nice to have around if I behaved. But I earned their respect,” Mason said in a 1995 interview with The Daily Herald.Mason entered the medical field at a time when women were a rarity among doctors. She specialized in family medicine and treated multiple generations of patients in Snohomish County.On Aug. 13, Mason died of complications related to Parkinson’s disease. She was 92. Mason was preceded in death by her husband in 1993. She’s survived by four children and 10 grandchildren.https://lnkd.in/gJGeuaKc

Happy Friday All!Today we celebrate Women's Equality Day in commemoration of the 19th amendment that granted women the right to vote. Women's Equality Day was established after 50,000 women across the country united to parade down New York City’s Fifth Avenue with linked arms blocking rush hour traffic. This was a powerful statement and the Women’s Strike for Equality March became one of the biggest women’s rights rallies in the U.S. See image below.  How can we celebrate Women’s Equality Day today?Pay your respects through virtual education ( hence today’s post 😊)Use social media to spread awareness virtually Empower women to show up at the polls- 74 days from midterm Election DayThree Powerful Songs That Embody the Feminine Spirit of This Day! Respect by Aretha FranklinGirl on Fire by Alicia KeysMan!

Below is a wonderful image that depicts our gender biases. Recently, on the occasion of international daughter’s day, I decided to test my pre teen daughter’s views. I asked her each of the imaginary scenarios listed in the image below and then I asked her to describe the role holder. Through her description, I figured whether she was talking about a man or a woman. Mind you, I did not ask the direct question - is it a man or a woman? because I did not want her to understand where this was going. To my surprise, except for one scenario, she only imagined a woman in all others. Here is the most interesting part, the scenario in which she imagined a man was one which stated ‘someone crying in the office’! I asked her, “What made you think of a man in this situation whereas a woman in all the others?”  Without batting an eyelid she responded, “I could imagine YOU in all the scenarios. However, I don’t believe that you would cry in the office.” Without conscious effort, we surely become role models for our children in many different ways. We have more power to influence the next generation than we think. I hope we all raise our children to be more inclusive and unbiased than the society we have experienced. There is certainly a lot of hope!

National Daughters Day 2022 – Sunday, September 25!Daughters make our life joyful. We love them and love to be loved by them in return. As a father of two lovely daughters, I wish each one of us play our role to create a world where they are happier, safer, successful and inspire others. A recent study shows that the labor force participation rate of women with children has been lower than that of men with children in the same age group. I personally believe this is an important area we should focus on so our daughters don’t have to fall out of the workforce. ***”Please comment on what your organization does or your personal recommendations to improve young mom’s participation at work below this post”Chart: Madison Hoff/Insider  Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics #peopleanalytics #hranalytics #daughterlove #daughters #workforceanalytics #womenatwork #womenequality #femaleempowerment

During a simple business meeting, PubliSHEd was born...We had met to discuss a barter of creative services, but what happened next surprised us both. We began opening up to each other and being vulnerable about our dreams for our futures. We shared our hopes, values and our struggles. We confessed that we both wish we'd had access to a community of women who are building businesses and could be a sounding board and support group for us. We admitted that networking has been the #1 thing to help propel our business growth, but finding the RIGHT group was an ongoing challenge. We craved a space where women could come together and mirror the honest interaction we were having together in that moment. So, we decided to build it. A place where we would be seen, heard, loved and supported. A place where we could show up as we are, with the intention of growing, elevating our lives and learning from each other. We craved an environment of abundance where there is enough space (& business) for everyone and we can focus on collaboration, instead of viewing each other as competition. #publishednation...#collaboration #abundance #abundancemindset#growth #elevate #connection #inspiration #celebration #digitalmagazine #networking #community #kansascity #kclocal #womeninbusiness #womensupportingwomen #womenownedbusiness #womeninbiz #womenentrepreneurs #femaleentrepreneurs #digital #equalityforwomen #equality #womenequality

We celebrate the election of Liz Truss as the United Kingdom Prime Minister. In a world where women leadership as heads of state stand at only 13%, this is welcome progress towards more female representation in top leadership positions.Research has shown that countries with a greater proportion of women in top decision making positions in the legislature have lower levels of income inequalities, increased spending on health services and improved access to education and other social services.This is why as CREAW we remain committed to the effective participation of women in leadership by contributing to ensuring equal opportunities for and full participation of women in leadership positions across all spheres and spaces. #WomenInLeadership #WomenDeliver #WomenEquality

Happy Women's Equality Day! We are very far from where we need to be, but it is moments like this that people will hear our voice 📢.   I cannot express what an honor it was to ring in the closing bell of the NYSE in honor of this special day. I was surrounded by some of the most amazing women and allies today where I am leaving with hope that things will change. Again, remember women make up 50% of the world population, and the current stats in our workforce and pay simply does not add up.  We all need to put our name in action for change and for the next generation.  Why is it that women who can give the miracle of birth are yet undermined when it comes to taking time off, given that next opportunity or bias returning back to work?  It is inequality by nature.  We are all responsible for this and need to change the game.  So remember when you make that next hire or invest in someone, are you impacting change or are you encouraging the unfortunate status quo?  I vote for change 💪🏼.Thank you Kirthiga Reddy and Ashutosh Garg for taking action and launching Laddrr 🎯. So great meeting so many amazing powerful women supporting each other.

Today, I had the privilege to facilitate a Women in the Workplace session alongside my #dei committee members, Kellan Reinikka and Kaitlyn Comer, CPA. With our SC&H Group colleagues joining both in person and virtually, we had a really productive discussion about: ▪ The underrepresentation of women in corporate America,   ▪ Likeability vs. competence (especially in leadership roles),▪ Evidence of the gender gap,▪ What it means to be an ally/advocate for women, and▪ How our people can continue to support the career progress and success of all women at our firm.We shared and discussed personal and professional experiences, the hardships and burnout that come with stereotyping, and the importance of recognizing unconscious biases that can impair our behaviors, reactions/responses, and our relationships. These are not always easy conversations to have, and I value having the space to conduct these sessions in a safe and encouraging environment. Even more so, I value having coworkers who are willing to be vulnerable, to speak up, and who are sometimes simply there to listen and learn. We can't effect change if we ignore the issues that plague us. So, thank you to everyone for showing up, being present, and putting in the work. I look forward to continuing the conversation and being part of the necessary change. #womenequality #womeninbusiness #womenempowerment #equality

Saw Teri Wesley ‘s post today about #womenequalityday and it inspired me to release my episode with Connie P. See post herehttps://lnkd.in/giYNHhwUMy daddy has a jaw-dropping perspective shift in this episode.  Connie Polke and I met on the SNF (Skilled Nursing Facilities) Spotlight Series I was producing in Chicago and she was guesting.  Our relationship blossomed from there.  This is one of the final interviews I did in Chicago.  She got to meet my dad, interview me, and I interviewed her.  (Shout out Yitz Rubin)Connie is an animal lover, a helper, and a caretaker of others.  She has overcome abuse, abortion, and raising children as a single mom.  She's worked in healthcare for her whole career as an employee and an entrepreneur and now she's going back to school.  Growing up she asked herself how am I going to get out of this house?  Today we are talking about confidence, believing in yourself, and legacy.  Better Call Daddy: The Safe Space for Controversy.Have you ever changed your perspective after hearing someone’s story?

Last year, the government amended the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP) to allow several categories of women to seek abortions between 20 and 24 weeks. The list included rape survivors, minors, women with mental disabilities, women with foetuses that had major abnormalities and married women whose marital status had changed during the pregnancy.The judgement on 29th sept 2022 clarified that the amendment did not distinguish between married and unmarried women and that it must also include unmarried women in consensual relationships.#abortionrights #indianlaws #supremecourtofindia #pregnancy #womenrights #womenequality #maternity #judgements

How authentic are we?🤔Authenticity is a collection of choices that we have to make every day. It’s about the choice to show up and be real. The choice to be honest. The choice to let our true selves be seen.” Brene BrownWith this time and age, all of us were bothered by how people perceives us to be. But the truth is, people loves us because of how we portray our truest self.

You have what it takes to overcome them and reach your goals. Keep moving forward.

*Long Post, Feeling Chatty*Dedicating this year's #WomenEqualityDay to those who came before me to pave the way --- my aunt (who recently transitioned) attended South Carolina State University (then South Carolina State College) in the 60s as a result of previous family members attending various HBCUs and the desire for a better life. Her stories and wisdom will forever be a lasting memory for me!Ten years later my mother then attended the same institution, studied business (accounting concertation), and pledged the illustrious Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated35 years later I came along and these ladies along with several other family members, community leaders, church members, and family friends poured into "Tiny Tab" -- I am FOREVER grateful for their love, sacrifices, and dedication to lifting up others.I could've been counted out because teenage Tab was a force to be reckoned with however they didn't let up -- I look up to a plethora of women from various backgrounds + industries who've done amazing things but when it comes to my village, I STAND -- there ability to set an example of excellence despite navigating poverty, Jim Crow, various traumas and other issues WITHOUT Google, social media, or any of the modern casualties we have today BLOWS my mind!When you see me prevailing, pressing for more, and setting the stage for the next generation of leaders, understand that I'm leaning on the shoulders of my village . . . this is my way of paying it forward!#womeninbusiness #womenequality #blackgirlmagic

If you and I do nothing to change the current inequalities faced by women globally, then according to the United Nations and UN Women gender equality in the highest positions of power will not be reached for another 130 years.:The implications of the above can be detrimental at community and state levels. Apart from that, United Nations #sdg5  will fail to be realized significantly. It also means that strategic development may be undermined. This is because of the crucial role women play as participants and decision-makers in the development process in a multitude of areas.:Currently, only 10 countries have a woman Head of State, and 13 Countries have a woman Head of Government.:You and I have work to do.Some excerpts from my presentation at the recently ended Second European Conference on African Studies (#SESCA22) under the auspices of the Centre for African Studies Basel ZASB, Switzerland.

Today is #WomensEqualityDay, commemorating the adoption of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution in 1920. With a nod to women's equality, I want to highlight a fellow Marine who recently published a book regarding her challenges in the USMC. My hope is that her experience can help in making the Corps a better fighting machine by bringing awareness of the ways we can improve; my intent is NOT to disparage the USMC, but rather shine a light on the places the organization can improve. Without women, none of us exist. We must recognize their critical importance to our lives and provide them with the dignity & respect they are due. We need women to create & sustain life on this planet and we need to treat them as first-class citizens, in all aspects of life. #womenequality #DoBetter #Marines

Happy Women's Equality Day! Let's celebrate everyone that has fought for the freedoms we have today. American women on August 26, 1920, with the passage of the 19th Amendment (the Voting Rights Act of 1965 secured voting rights for racial minorities).Before 1974, women were not legally permitted to obtain a mortgage without a male cosigner. Today, women actually outpace men in getting mortgages: 19 percent of today's single homebuyers are women, compared with just 9 percent of single men, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR)Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 forever changed the way women do business. It was the first legislation to recognize the importance of female entrepreneurs in the national economy. Until the passing of the act, women business owners were not allowed to take out business loans in their own name.As of March, there were 74 female CEOs employed at America's 500 highest-grossing companies, up from 41 in June of 2021 and only 7 in 2002. Yet, the new high still only translates to around 15 percent female representation at the top of the country's biggest public businesses.#womenempowerment #womenequality #womenequalityday #femaleleadership

Jessica Wade began writing Wikipedia biographies about women and minority scientists who never got their due — from employers, from other scientists, from the public.The 33-year-old London-based physicist has become something of a phenomenon herself — both an irresistible force and immoveable object — in her very personal campaign to bring more girls to study and work in #STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).#physicswallah #zepto #biocon #nykaa #leadershipqualities #leadershipculture #leadershipmindset #people #karansayz #trendingnow #mustwatch #startups #learningagility #linkedin #startup #innovation #entrepreneurs #entrepreneurship #growth #business #businessandmanagement #digitization #yourstory #TECHNOLOGYADOPTION #SMALLBUSINESSES #MSMES #MARKETPLACES #ecommerce #marketplace #merchants #payments #b2c #bartercredit #retail #financialservices #b2b #technology #quality #sourcing #commerce #omnichannel #onlineshopping #womenentrepreneurbs #womenempowerment #womeninbusinesss #womenatwork #yourstory #mckinseydigital #festiveseason2021 #nykaa #nykaaipo #falguninayar #billionairemindset #madeinindia #truestory #womenentrepreneurs #womenempowerment #womenpower #beleiveinyourself #womenbusinessowners #womeninbusiness #womenempoweringwomen #womenfashion #womenandwealth #womenchangemakers #womenandfinance #womenhelpingwomen #womenfounders #womenequality #womenentrepreneurship #womenceo #womenclothing #womeninbiz #womenandmoney #womenbusinessleaders #falguninayyar #indianentrepreneurs #indianabusiness #fridaymotivation

Is it only in India where people don’t realize that starting a conversation with, “Oh, you’ve put on weight!” is incredibly rude? Perhaps I should respond with “Oh, you’ve become uglier!” so they get the point. From stores that do not stock clothes my size to unsolicited advice from neighborhood aunties, my life—quite annoyingly—is ruled by the numbers on the scale. What’s the big deal about being big? You may wonder. Ell, quite a lot, actually. OR starters, you get dumped by the only man you’ve ever loved, social situations go from awkward to embarrassing within seconds, and don’t even get me started on the family’s never-ending search for a suitable groom. They just don’t make men my size these days! Nevertheless, here I am, about to meet Suitor No. 7. Begrudgingly, of course. Ide along as I navigate the crazy arranged marriage market. And trust me, it’s crazier when you’re more than a little curvy.Post Dedicated to #Overweight #women #Girls #buildconfidence #india #people #inspireothers #motivateothers #indians #like #likesharecomment #inspirationalleader #inspirations #womenempowerment #womenequality #women #girlpower

Why are we more comfortable talking about women’s “empowerment” than women’s “power”?There’s a subtle but important difference between the two. In this week’s newsletter, I explore what it means to be a powerful woman at work. Yes, words do matter!Also, I hope you’ll join me next Wednesday, 9/14, at 11am PST when I discuss women in the workplace with two of the most powerful women I know: Indra Nooyi and Kelli Thompson.

We stand with Iranian women!Iran has a long established rule of compulsorily wearing a hijab which was established following 1979 Islamic Revolution.The rule is so strict that government has assigned morality police also known as Gasht-e-ershad. The global movement of right of women started with a 22 year old Iranian women called Mahsa Amini who was  arrested by morality police for 'not wearing hijab in a proper way'. Over the course of time she succumbed to her injuries and died in the custody.Protests broke out all over Iran and they started Anti-Hijab Protest. Women use to wear hijab before the law was passed in Iran but as women are being imprisoned and thrashed for not wearing hijab in a proper way it has become a symbol of oppression for women.Looking at it from a global perspective, Indian Women are fighting for wearing hijab and Iranian Women are fighting for not wearing hijab but there is one thing common, they are both fighting for RIGHT OF WOMEN TO HAVE A CHOICE.#righttochoice #women #womenempowement #womenequality #genderequality #choice #oppression #volunteer #gogirl #gogirlorganisation

At the behest of Rep. Bella Abzug (D-NY), in 1971 and passed in 1973, the U.S. Congress designated August 26 as “Women’s Equality Day.” The date was selected to commemorate the 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote. This was the culmination of a massive, peaceful civil rights movement by women that had its formal beginnings in 1848 at the world’s first women’s rights convention, in Seneca Falls, New York. The observance of Women’s Equality Day not only commemorates the passage of the 19th Amendment, but also calls attention to women’s continuing efforts toward full equality. Workplaces, libraries, organizations, and public facilities now participate with Women’s Equality Day programs, displays, video showings, or other activities. #womenequality #celebrate #equality

On this day, August 26th, in 1920 women gained the right to vote in the United States when the 19th amendment was put into effect. I'd like to give a shout out to all of the women throughout history who have fought for our rights, including this right to vote! I'd like to also give a shout out to all the women who express this right in every election. To those who don't? Shame on you. #dobetter #bebetter #womenequality

In honor of Women’s Equality Day, I invite you to be the next generation of “shoulders,” with strength and agility unlike any before. What do I mean?Just under 10 years ago, my husband, Ethan Keller, bought me a copy of 'Lean In' for a beach vacation (Harry Potter aside, I’m not one for fiction :). It had become a NYT best-seller and his female manager had recommended it to him. A bit late, but I totally owe a thank you to Jane Wang!I was a corporate world rookie and this book delivered inspiration for the type of female leader I wanted to become. It also educated me on the hard truths of being a woman, or even becoming a female leader, in a seemingly “developed world.” As Sheryl Sandberg rightly noted, the promise of equality is not the same as true equality. However, she highlighted the progress that had been made: "We stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us, women who had to fight for the rights that we now take for granted."And today is a celebration of those strides. 102 years ago today, (some) women were legally granted the right to vote with the 19th amendment. The suffragists were some of the first “shoulders” bearing the responsibility of fighting for female equality in America.True equality will take time to achieve—and from my own experience I’d say it requires personal sacrifice and lots of allyship—but it’s the world we can together build. It’s the world I want for my two daughters, for myself, for us all. Let’s be the next generation of “shoulders” – those who deliver on the promise of true equality. The ones who make the dream a reality. #leanin #womenequality #womenequalityday #progress #future #america

Una armadura contra la violencia doméstica, una armadura que ninguna mujer debería necesitar, un vestido de novia que busca despertar a la sociedad de la pesadilla que se está volviendo paisaje y llamar la atención sobre las abominables cifras de mujeres que han sido brutalmente agredidas, golpeadas, quemadas o degolladas. Una armadura que va más allá de un uso inteligente de ciertos materiales y trasciende un simple diseño, es una fuerte crítica hacia los comportamientos irracionales que radican en la legitimación de la desigualdad y la inmensa falta de sensibilidad social.Brutal campaña de Carling Black Label, ojalá no sea sólo una campaña más. #marketing #advertising #campaign #diseño #womenequality #womenrights

We celebrated Women's Equality Day at the Anacostia Sandlot kicking off the new site in Ward 8. It was packed with local agencies l led by DC Office on Womens Policy and DC Mayor Bowser came with her daughter to highlight the policy accomplishments for women in the District from home ownership to maternal health.Women’s Equality Day is celebrated in the United States annually on August 26. The day commemorates the decision to give women official voting right in the USA in 1920 after a long struggle. An amendment known as the Nineteenth Amendment was made to the US constitution in 1920 to give equal voting rights to women. By the mid-1920, 35 of the 50 states in the USA had voted in favor of the legislation for voting rights for women. However, the ratification needed 3/4th or 36 favor votes to be passed by the federal government.The fight continues and WANDA is doing our part in the food movement with more representation and equity from producers to consumers.#womenequality #InvestinWomen #equalpay #womenspolicy

The 15th amendment gave women the right to vote and their voice treated equally.  What other ways can we see ourselves as equal?  A great way to recognize and celebrate the women that fought for the right to vote is by registering to vote and making sure your voice is heard.  http://ow.ly/2sUz50K5V4H#equality #womenequality #thebeliefcoaching #ibelieve #empowerment

Today I attended "Special conversation on Women's Equality" by Fable with 2 of industry giants Indra Nooyi and Padmasree Warrior . The discussion was beautifully moderated by @Kelly Thompson (www.kelliraethompson.com). It was truly a feast for the audience to listen to these leader's conversation where they shared insights about the industry, struggle and women equality. Personally, many takeaways. Beautiful advice from Indra Nooyi herself are: 1.Define your #proposition, 2.Invest in yourself, 3.Invest in Simple, Clear and Effective communication. Where Padmasree Warrior shares the importance of 1.Learning to simplify complexity 2.Ability to listen 3.To constantly learn no matter where you are in the leadership pyramid.Great insights from great leaders and audience were indeed in for a treat!! Thank you Fable for organizing this.#leadership #learning #indranooyi #women #hardwork #leader #womenequality #equality #investinyourself #valueproposition #listeningskills #communicationskills

Amber Naslund states how confident women can come across as abrasive or "difficult to work with". However, this is am important call to all womxn identified folxs to remember how important your voice and leadership style is in the workplace #boardroom #home #work and #community.The workplace continues to work from a patriarchal perspective of competition, one person has the power, and data drives every decision. However, Feminine leadership (which any gender identity can exhibit) works from a space of compassion, collaboration, empathy, intuition, cooperation,  inclusion, creativity, vulnerability, enhancing the self-worth of others, and systems-thinking. Are you colluding to uphold systems that label confident womxn as "difficult" or "abrasive"? The more self aware we are of our own unconscious biases towards a specific leadership style, the more we can lean into a growth mindset to welcome different styles of leadership. Take a moment now to tag a confident womxn leader in your network. Let them know how you experience their leadership in the comments!#womenatwork #womenequality #womenempowerwomen #womenempowerment #womeninbusiness #latinaintech #latinaleaders #highereducation #highered #highereducationleadership #womxn #womenempoweringwomen #leadership #mindset #inclusion #empathy

THE FACE OF INEQUALITY.  This post isn’t anything against my colleague, yet it clearly show the extreme inequality in funding. IT ISN’T MY QUALIFICATIONS I hold two engineering degrees, computer hardware and software engineering degrees, an Executive MBA from top school, Emory University - Goizueta Business School inclusive being the recipient of the Entrepreneurship Award! I have over 25 years of relevant experience to the industries ZIPPYAR is targeting PHARMA, HEALTHCARE, CPG , RETAIL.  https://lnkd.in/g9ChSGUZIT ISN’T ZIPPYAR TECHNOLOGY PRODUCT MARKET FITIn 2014 I envisioned what is in demand today, connecting the physical and digital world, and so the idea for the direct recording and streaming of videos from products was born! Today ZIPPYAR has more than 5 pending patents and a granted trademark that I am doing as a pro-se. Boostrapped! WHAT ABOUT ZIPPYAR TEAM?I had several great people on ZIPPYAR team that I couldn’t retain.  Nonetheless am well networked and have many people asking to work with me once ZIPPYAR is funded.ACCESS TO CAPITAL MATTERS, and limiting it is used as a tool to perpetuate inequalities. TIME FOR CHANGE!  A world with fair justice, peace and equal opportunities is SUSTAINABLE!  #entrepreneurship #startup #startupfunding #funding #womenequalityday #womenequality

Happy Women’s Equality Day! What better way to honor the contributions of women than highlighting the achievements of this year’s Dallas Business Journal 25 Women in Business Honorees! What an incredible group of leaders changing the face of their industries and making great strides in their communities. What a beautiful program and event. I am honored and humbled to be included and recognized. Speaking yesterday at this event I shared that my hope is that my grandparents and parents know that I represent all the hard work and sacrifice they made in their lives as West Texas cotton pickers and my parents in blue collar positions. Hoping and praying that we would be pushed to a more equal place. Always striving for more opportunities for their children. My heart is full of pride knowing that my history is filled with an incredible work ethic and commitment to family.To my Linebarger family, so blessed to work with talented and good people who strive for excellence representing our government clients each day! You are the best! To my friends and colleagues, I would not be who I am today without your love, guidance and support reminding me that wherever I am in life you are there. And to my husband and children you are the light and the joy that radiates inside of me. Here’s to all young girls, early career professional women and everyone in between, you are enough and always let your light shine, it makes the world brighter! We believe in you!Dallas Business Journal Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson, LLP #career #love #opportunities #beopen #dallastx #womensupportingwomen #womenempoweringwomen #womenequality #entrepreneur #texastechlawyer Texas Tech University Ellyce Lindberg Cristina Caballero Becky Powell-Schwartz

Today is International Women's Equality Day ... It always takes me back to this quote from the late Muhammad Ali Jinnah (the founder of Pakistan).

There is a third power stronger than both, that of the women."At a personal level the engineering team that I work on "LinkedIn Audience Network" truly embodies #womenequality #witpower #womenintech. 12 out of the 22 members on LAN Engineering Team are strong #wit engineers.

Although business leaders have been making a concerted effort to embrace gender diversity and inclusion in recent years, there is still much to be done. Stereotypical notions promoting gender inequality continue to plague the labor markets.It’s not just about a pay gender gap. It’s not just offensive, sexist comments during meetings. It’s not just promotions for like-minded ‘bros’. It’s all of that and many more behaviors and stereotypes that poison the workplace culture.If leveraged right, gender diversity can benefit not just female, but also male employees. Multiple perspectives spark novel thinking and innovative ideas, ensuring a happier and more productive workplace for all.Listen to the podcast on https://bit.ly/3Nc2nwE where the host Jeanne Cuff talks to Kayla Harrington, a Legal Research Assistant at Thomson Reuters, and her father Jeff Harrington about gender inclusivity and what companies should do to ensure equal representation in the workplace. #womenempowerement #inclusiveworkplace #genderinclusivity  #womenequality #workplaceequity #genderdiscrimination #genderpaygap #genderdiversity #workplaceexperience #workculturematters

Today is known as Women's Equality Day.  August 26th, 1920 is the date that the U.S. Congress passed the 19th Amendment which guarantees American women the right to vote. From the beginning of our nation in 1776 to 1920, it took 144 years for women to participate in elections.The story of #suffrage, the word that describes this movement, has its roots in July 1848 when the first Woman’s Rights Convention takes place in Seneca Falls and key leaders write a document called the Declaration of Sentiments.Fast forward to when the amendment passed in 1920, there were still some restrictions. Native American, Asian American, Latinx and African American women still didn't have the right to vote. The struggle continued for many woman for some time after 1920.For more details and history about suffrage and Woman's Equality Day, we highly recommend that you check out any of the following web pages.• U.S. Government National Archives, "The 19th Amendment" - https://lnkd.in/enX6Sh4• PBS American Experience, "The Vote" - https://lnkd.in/eB636Ka• National Park Service, "The 19th Amendment: A Crash Course" - https://lnkd.in/eKDihFk#WomensEqualityDay #WomenEquality #WomensEmpowerment #WomenEmpowerment

Calling all #female investors!!!!!! #femaleentrepreneurs #femaleinvestors I’m so excited about the traction this post has received and thank you for all the messsges. BUT… all of the DM’s have been from males looking to join our group. Maybe I don’t have enough female connections.Where are all the #ladies at? We are looking for some #women to join our group! There are not enough #womeninsports especially in ownership. Our group would like to #change that! This is a call to action for #women to contact me about this opportunity, WE WANT YOU! If you know a woman who is looking to invest in something tag her in the comments. The team we are buying is a lower division club so the investment is not substantial and they have a women’s team which is part of the sale!

Thanks for the words of wisdom Aishvarya Murali! You are such an inspiration :) You are #emotional #sensitive #takingittooseriously #takingitpersonally #breathing ... You need to #chill #relax #takeiteasy #moveon etc etc is how women are brushed off when they stand-up and speak-up for themselves!Its difficult to "Be and stay" ourselves but is possible when we stop worrying about how we are perceived. The key is to focus on doing what is right, natural, have a mentor and the rest follows suit.

Today is #womensequalityday  and as a mother of two little girls, Emilia & Luna, I hope it is not as hard for them. Today we raise awareness, we speak for equality & empowerment for Women. What is the purpose of striving for equality? It’s  is to create a level playing field, however that only works if everyone starts at the same place. Therefore we need to recognize the importance of equity. So let’s start the conversations.#Equity vs #Equality- Equity is giving everyone what they need to be successful. Equality is treating everyone the same.But gender equity states that “the individual who is historically the most marginalised, should be given more and better opportunities than the gender enjoying the perks of living in a gender biased society… Equity hence ensures an intersectional view of development in the society.  Inequity means unfair competition which will not result in justice”  (What is Gender Equity and How is it Different from Gender Equality, Sarkar, 2022)Kudos to all all the women and also my #latinas who have paved the way for better opportunities for us. Still a long road ahead of us. Did you know?-Latinas are the lowest paid segment in the U.S.-Latinas make only $.57 for every dollar made by white non Hispanic men-Latinas ask for promotions and raises at similar rates to white men but for every 100 men promoted, only 71 Latinas get promoted To learn more read the infographic from The Hispanic Star below ⬇️ #equitymatters #genderequity #genderequality #womenempowerment #womenequality #latinaprofessionals

Congratulations to Sunita, our new “Customer Loyalty Certificate” awardee, who, to start animal husbandry, secured a loan of 50,000 rupees from our Hansi branch. She took out this loan in the third cycle. She continues to be one of our most committed customers.Sunita inherited animal husbandry work from her family who had been doing this for years but not getting financial support is what held her back to start her own work but she overcame that with the help of Ambition Services. Sunita is pleased that she is assisting her husband in the overall welfare of her family.#AmbitionServices #Ambiserv #BadhteKadam #AmbitionIndia #CustomerLoyaltyProgram #CustomerLoyalty #CLP #Microfinance #FinancialInclusion #Empowerment #Certificate #Entrepreneurs #LoanServices #Microcredit #WomenEmpowerment #WomenEquality #Appreciation

#WomensEqualityDay is not just about providing #equalopportunities for work, but also about developing open and accepting #mindset at a #social level. #Organizations are a sub-unit of the society and for any organization to drive #genderinclusion and provide equal opportunities to #women, we need to change the mindset of the society at large and building a #culture of #progressive #India. In a recent panel discussion on Women's Equality Day by ET Now Swadesh, our Founder and Managing Partner - Sonica Aron (She/Her/Hers) spoke about how #womenequality is not just the responsibility of the organization but also of each one of us. We are all victims of #socialconditioning and while we are overcoming it, it is a long way to go.

Happy Women's Equality Day!While we've come a long way toward equality in the workplace, it's crucial that employers continue to step up their support for women to attract and retain top talent in an ever-changing and fiercely competitive labor market. Additionally, leaders should go beyond inclusivity and take steps to support the mental health, and well-being needs specific to women professionals.

Though women were a significant part of their society in the past, they were not considered equal to men in any manner. They were denied their rights and freedom. They lived their lives behind closed doors and behind masks.The Civil Rights Act of 1964 barred discrimination in public places, schools, and employment based on race, religion, color, or national origin. However, sex discrimination was not originally included in the planned statute and was only inserted as an amendment to Title VII to prevent its passing.On October 13, 1967, Presidential Executive Order 11375 revised Executive Order 11246 to ban discrimination based on Gender. Even in the modern day, women still experience gender discrimination.

Most of us remember vividly where we were when significant events - breakthroughs and catastrophes - happened in our lifetime. This is not so with complex processes into which we are embedded, such as the climate emergency we find ourselves in. Not because we don't  know, but because we resist to letting it rise beyond the threshold of  conscious awareness and deliberate attention. Perhaps because it is emotionally overwhelming, the implication too dire, or the solution  daunting, unclear or elusive.  Yesterday in the press conference of the German government, something extraordinary took place: what could be misunderstood as a book release, was in fact an display and awakening of a different level of collective consciousness that links science, government, business, industry, and citizens in a mission seemingly impossible - creating the foundation for human surviving and thriving in the face of "the greatest existential threat" to humankind.The scientists of The Club of Rome, which has demonstrated its prescience before, were given this official floor to sound alarm and a call to collective action. Importantly, they confirm what most of us intuit, namely that climate change is progressing faster than predicted. They warn specifically of social collapse that is fueled by rising social inequalities and societal breakdown of vulnerable nations. They also emphasize that global, exponential action now is needed if we are to succeed. Extensive research supports that the interconnected effects of 5 "extraordinary turnarounds" make up an integrated, systemic solution. They emphasize that all 5 are within our reach, but only if we take bold and courageous action swiftly:> Ending poverty> Addressing inequality> Empowering women> Making food systems healthy for people and ecosystems> Transitioning to clean energy while reducing demandThe report emphasizes the social dimension as the most significant manifestation of the current crisis, but also as the most important levers of turnaround. It is our contention that it will take inclusive leadership at all levels of social organization to pull this extraordinary turnaround off ... and that is why this symbolic display at an official government forum is so critical. If we are to succeed, inclusiveness among the diverse agents and stakeholders is the essential social foundation.The following YouTube video lets you watch the event. It is both in German and English and you may forward to timestamp 1:50 when the reporting starts in English.#inclusiveleadership #inclusiveleader #climatechange #climateaction #esg #esgstrategy #esginvesting #leadership #leadershipdevelopment #hr #diversity #diversityandinclusion #diversityequityinclusion #womenequality #genderequality #genderequity #genderbalance #povertyreduction #food #foodsystems #cleanenergytransition #cleanenergyfuture https://lnkd.in/efDsyXdH
