#life teaches us beautifully if we allow it. I and my Lil one found ourselves staring at this Lil pigeon trying to pick up twigs from a lawn to build its nest the past week during one of our trips. My seven-year-old kept asking - Does it have a smart brain to pull this task and is it the brain that's driving this? My answer was Yes and No.#life #lessonsforlife #mentalhealth #mojo #motivation #depression P.S: Pic Courtesy from my own #hopeville garden from Aug'22.

Food influences mood, but not the other way around. This new study of 1/2 a million concludes that the food we eat plays a causal role in depression, and that link is more powerful than the way that depression changes eating patterns.https://lnkd.in/gceHaW88Free eBook on the #diet for #depression:https://lnkd.in/gzFQ6B2C

Mushrooms - to treat depression?  A peer-reviewed trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that a compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms 'rewired the brains' of people suffering from depression, significantly reducing symptoms for up to 3 months.I've personally had profoundly beneficial experiences with plant medicines such as mushrooms and Ayahuasca, so I'm very happy to see this information starting to emerge in mainstream science.https://lnkd.in/euHC6n5c#mushrooms #depression #mentalhealth

I used to take 7-8 tablets a day for Depression.‘Its ok Sunpreet, there are worse medical complications in life. Atleast, you have a relief here’Thats what you would say.Well, let me tell you how it helped.Without medicine, i was simply Dead.With medicine, i am a Walking and Talking Dead.These medicines only make you numb.You dont feel any emotion - Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Pleasure.For me, both of these feelings are same :My loved one passing away = Me getting my dream jobEverything is just Ok for me.- Buy x? - Ok- Not Buy x - Ok- Travel? - Ok- No travel - Ok- Dress up - Ok- Dont dress up - OkOne becomes indifferent to mostly everything.My family thinks, i am so well-adjusted and flexible.‘So nice of Sunpreet, she is so calm.’🙇🏽‍♀️Nobody will understand you being dead inside since everyone interacts with the external you.As long as you are managing your responsiblities, nobody needs to pay attention to the inner you.Wait, the worse has yet to come -Identity crisis.You dont understand who is the real you.Whats your type.Which decision you need to take.- You are not ok with studying in India or you are ok with it.- You dont enjoy S*x or you do but its the medicines.- You want to pursue hobby Yoga or its just another escapeAfter the worse, here comes the most disastrous of all :Being a Mom is the most divine feeling of all.I missed out on that.(However, being a PCOS patient, having a Baby was a God gift for me)Even today, when my boy is 4.5, i struggle to realise that i am a Mother. He is MY own son.He loves me more than i do.This was one of the triggers for me to fight this Demon forever.F*ck you Depression!PS : My pic with my boy clicked last month.#depression #worklife #workingmom #stress #anxiety

Important milestone for patients, clinicians and researchers alike - the largest psilocybin clinical trial to date; generating invaluable insight into the clinical domains and operational realities of psilocybin therapy in the treatment of depression. Justifying larger and longer trials, this study was a real team effort, across countries and institutions, requiring collaboration and trust, respect to the human experience of pain and the desire and will to alleviate suffering. Congratulations to all involved at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and COMPASS Pathways! Most importantly, to those volunteers who participated in the trial, thank you - this is a significant undertaking pursued by individuals who have often faced a great deal of adversity and despite that, found within themselves inspiring and life-affirming reservoirs of determination, hope and courage.

This trial is small and open-label, but it changes my thinking. On the surface, it shows that pramipexole (Mirapex) treated anhedonic #depression (ie, depression with lack of pleasure/reward). Not a surprise as the med activates dopamine in the reward center (nucleus accumbens). Dig deeper and we see that treatment with pramipexole reduced inflammatory biomarkers in the body like c-reactive protein.Why is that surprising? Because inflammation in the body is one of the "root causes" of anhedonia - it wears down dopamine in the brain. Prior to this I thought that pramipexole only addressed that end-organ damage and not the root cause. How can a med that works in the brain reduce inflammation in the body?Open to ideas. Maybe it's just that the patients changed their lifestyle, slept better, handled stress better, and got more physically active, all of which have anti-inflammatory effects.Article here:https://lnkd.in/g9-SWPS6And a brief guide to using pramipexole:https://lnkd.in/ga-qZpdM

I’m learning heaps about this right now for professional interest, and I guess personal too since we all have mental health and worrying times lead to worrying thoughts. We could all find ourselves with symptoms of depression and it’s worth being forarmed with this information.

Really interesting post Ben Palmer part of me feels like Gary Coulton  like I need to give this some thought before firing off ideas 😂... However, the first thing that popped into my head was everyone having a voice and im not just talking about the students here. There needs to be a culture of respect and value all the way through the school. Sadly in many schools, I have been to I think TAs and support staff can feel dismissed when they have amazing ideas, some teachers have fantastic solutions for complex jobs and there will be people on everyone's team that are natural project planners. If we start by recognising and *celebrating* the skills and unique differences we have within our team, this attitude will permeate. Praising passion and innovation from everywhere in the school will model the skills and attitudes we want our students to adopt and ultimately create a culture of inclusion for everyone 😊💪💕

"Scientists claim to have found the first direct evidence that people with #depression have a reduced capacity for releasing serotonin in the #brain.The findings from a brain-imaging study reignite a debate within psychiatry over the so-called #serotonin hypothesis of depression and challenge the conclusions of an influential review published in July that found “no clear evidence” that low serotonin levels are responsible. The latest work, led by scientists at Imperial College London, suggested that people with depression have a decreased serotonin response."

Depression loves to hit you when you’re least expecting it and it just did.I’ve often found that in the difficult moments that there’s comfort in darkness. And that can mean literal darkness like being outside in the evening or wearing dark clothes. Somehow it provides a layer of comfort around me, when I feel it taking hold. I’ve always wondered if anyone else feels this and if it’s part of living with depression. Today it’s been raining all day and I decided to go for a walk in the rain. I’ve always loved walking in the rain, even on the good days but in the dark, feeling that comfort of the brisk wind, the rain hitting my face and the darkness around me. It helped me focus my thoughts and take control.How do you find comfort in these moments?  #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #wellbeing #depression #chronicpain

For those that see this that may need a little support right now. I’ve recently had my own mental health issues and we must continue to change the narrative regarding mental health. The strongest thing you can do is admit to yourself you’re struggling, it’s strong to speak out, it’s strong to ask for help, it’s strong to say you’re not ok right now. For those that see this that may need a little support right now, you are stronger than you know, and you are not on your own I promise. #mentalhealth #help #change #depression

Really excited to be able to share this incredibly important #migranthealth work by our incredible National Centre for Naturopathic Medicine at Southern Cross University research fellow Peter James and colleagues at University of Sierra Leone, Fourah Bay College, Torrens University Australia and Western Sydney University looking at the #mentalhealth burden of #African migrants globally, recently published in Psychiatry Research. Approximately 1 in 3 African migrants globally suffer from #anxiety and #depression while 3 in 8 suffer from PTSD, and systems generally failt to acknowledge the pre-migration and post-migration stressors of this community. It's clear that we need to develop and implement culturally appropriate mental health interventions that address post-migration stressors that increase their risk of mental ill-health and successful integration into host communities. Failure to do so means we also fail to help migrants realise their full potential, as well as fail to fully unleash the extraordinary human potential the African diaspora can bring to host countries as well as the African continent.

***People don’t fake depression.. they fake being ok**DEPRESSION TIPS:Shower. Not a bath, a shower. Use water as hot or cold as you like. You don’t even need to wash. Just get in under the water and let it run over you for a while. Sit on the floor if you gotta.Put on clean, comfortable clothes.Drink water, plenty of it. Use ice, if you want. Add some mint or lemon for an extra boost.Go outside and get some sunshine - take a walk, play, relax, swim, just do it outside even if it’s for 15 minutes. Get some exercise, if you have a gym membership use it. If you don’t, do some calisthenics, or simple exercises that don’t require additional equipment.Clean something. Doesn’t have to be anything big. Organize one drawer of a desk. Wash five dirty dishes. Do a load of laundry. Scrub the bathroom sink.Blast music. Listen to something upbeat and dancy and loud, something that’s got lots of energy. Sing to it, dance to it, even if you suck at both.Make food. Don’t just grab a granola bar to munch. Take the time and make food. Even if it’s ramen. Add something special to it, like a soft boiled egg or some veggies. Prepare food, it tastes way better, and you’ll feel like you accomplished something.Make something. Write a short story or a poem, draw a picture, color a picture, fold origami, crochet or knit, sculpt something out of clay, anything artistic. Even if you don’t think you’re good at it. Create.Go outside. Take a walk. Sit in the grass. Look at the clouds. Smell flowers. Put your hands in the dirt and feel the soil against your skin. Take off your shoes and walk in the grass, sand or dirt. Ground yourself ❤️Call someone. Call a loved one, a friend, a family member, call a chat service if you have no one else to call. Talk to a stranger on the street. Have a conversation and listen to someone’s voice. If you can’t bring yourself to call, text or email or whatever, just have some social interaction with another person. Even if you don’t say much, listen to them. It helps. (You can always call/text/message me!)May seem small or silly to some, but this list keeps people alive. * At your absolute best you won’t be good enough for the wrong people. But at your worst, you’ll still be worth it to the right ones. Remember that.

Flew into LA yesterday with someone that used to be terrified of flying that would use a combination of diazepam and wine to get them through. It was brilliant to see the positive impact of my work firsthand and the difference this has made in their lives. I obviously don’t travel with all my clients in person, although many do talk about my voice of encouragement and reason travelling with them. I find what works for each individual and love ❤️ using metaphors which the brain loves also. The trip is with my partner’s daughter and we are over in the US celebrating a 30th birthday. Wish it was mine and what I’d give to be 30 again. Here is Los Angeles the sun is yet to rise and I’ve already received this WhatsApp message below. Quick msg to say I'm home after fab Aussie hol and SMASHED IT on the flights home (and the flights to and from Sydney). So pleased! and so grateful 🙏 Will book in soon. Motorways next! 😊They’d already sent positive messages and selfies on the flights to Dubai and the Australia. I go above and beyond to help those that place their trust in me and whilst I’m more that just solely a hypnotherapist, my work also isn’t solely phobia work, with my specialisms being in anxiety and depression. This work sees me helping people to fly in a different way. I rarely have time to do posts and I’m lucky that my body clock is slightly out of sync and that this  has afforded me the time to post. The suns just about to come up and I’m going to enjoy this amazing place we are staying where the decking surrounds the house and is upstairs in the top of the trees. (Check out the Treehouse, Long Beach 🏖 if you want to really see great photos).

THE SCARIEST TRUTHFor a long time, I have been subjected to the taboo around being a Psychology student with Recurrent D and Anxiety. My determination, hopes and dreams have been questioned many a time by my very own people. And as I completed my master's degree and started doing internships, I realized how big of a myth that is. I used to go to the hospital every morning, having taken three medicines to manage my terrible lows and their side effects. It was really difficult for me to digest when I was told that I might have to stay on medications probably for the most part of my life. #psychology  Every afternoon, I used to force myself to eat lunch because I had to take two more pills. And even after feeling absolutely pathetic on some days, I used to get up each morning, more enthusiastically than the day before, to watch patients and learn something new every day. The more I soaked myself into the work, the more I realized that I was born for this job, and for me, it gives the greatest satisfaction; helping others! Being someone who has now been on both sides of the table can tell this very confidently that if you have anxiety or depression, your head is the worst place you would want to visit. Try to stay out of it, get help if you need it, and if you are in the profession, try to make that sense of empathy your strength. I know it is hard. I know it is challenging, but that one "Thank you" from your patient will change everything. Trust the process. Be grateful.#psychology #myth #depression #mhealth #gratitude

Set rewards for yourself after a certain number of tasks.  #Depression #MentalHealthAwareness #MentalHealth #MentalHealthMatters

#WFH #challenges #wfo Man is a #social animal and very few can survive the isolation that WFH offers. Working in solitude can be disconcerting. This is especially true for the millennial generation who are dependent on colleagues for company and friendship to a large extent. 19% of WFH employees reported extreme loneliness and isolation. Loneliness can become chronic and cause deterioration of mental health as much as a physical ailment. The temporary reality of isolation has been causing of breakdown that ranges from mild to severe in some cases.Loss of workplace as a community#workplaces become a diverse and inclusive community, where every employee identifies as being a part of a group. There are common meeting spaces like the cafeteria or the coffee machine. There is an exchange of ideas and general camaraderie that enhances a sense of well-being. The sudden loss of this daily interaction can be detrimental to mental health. The office community often becomes a strong support system and workers feel lost without the common workplace.#virtual meetings are typically short, and business like with no social interaction. There is no stopping by the desk of a fellow employee or an exchange of pleasantries. While some workers seem to be coping well, in a majority of the WFH employees a sense of desolation creeps in after a few months. A feeling of belonging is integral to engagement and productivity dips in the long term.#wfh has no geographical boundaries leading to cultural isolationSome employees who work remotely may speak a different language and communication with managers and colleagues can be a big issue. Cultural differences amongst the team may lead to differences in attitude. Some countries treat managers like bosses where some have a more informal relationship. The employee coming from another geography and culture may feel alienated. #cultural  and communicative #isolation leads to #depression  and low performance matrices. The employee needs team spirit to enhance the sense of belonging which may be absent in remote workers. #attrition  becomes high and engagement remains low. #mentalhealth #business #community #productivity #engagement #team #ifma #corenetglobal #dupont Rakesh Almal Paresh Shah, Julio Patino, MCR, Larry Callahan, Rehan Shaikh KRISHAN PHOPHALIA Nithish Murthy, CFM, MCR Sameer Tandon, Pankaj Jathar, Pankaj Holani, Sanjeev Khetarpal  Abhishek Yadav Archana Nityananda Maneesh Kumar Rai, CPIM, CSCP, Vinay Kumar Shetty CFM® SFP® PMP®  FMP® IOSH MS Gundappa S Margutti, MRICS

No one is ready yet, no one!I started learning psychotherapies as I got interested in it to deal with my own internal demons which provoked me several times to end my life.The story started in the year 2000 when I tried to end my life for the first time as I felt like a failure and worthless creature. Then I tried it again once I came to know about the illicit affair of my husband after a decade of our marriage, and at that time when I was pregnant. Somehow, that realization, that with my death, I will be making two others to suffer, one was 7 years and the other who had not yet seen the world.Since then my journey of learning psychology and everything related to that started. I got deeper into that when I found that my daughter was depressed because of her parents' separation and it was clearly visible on her physical health and social life. I tried my level best to be her best friend and used to share everything with her to get her confidence. She has been a part of my life, still I couldn't stop her from getting fed up with all the worldly issues and pressures. On this 18th of August her tolerance level gave up and she left for another journey leaving all her loved ones stunned with her untimely departure.A so-called happy family with a lot of hopes and expectations lost a heart's piece to suicide. And all the others become the suicide survivors. We keep on ignoring the data of suicide deaths which is lesser than accidents, hunger and many other death reasons (as commented by many of the sadists) but can we really ignore the number of people affected by the suicide cases (especially the family members, friends, and even the distant relatives or peers)?It's time now to talk about suicide openly and save our loved ones from taking such a harsh step. Let's remove the shutters of our hearts and mind to listen to a tired soul to give some hope and bring a smile. Every night I wake up with the question how she could do that and how I couldn't get any hint of that. I kept on believing that she was such a strong girl who can be an inspiration to many.  She was interested in psychiatry too and wanted to be a mental health practitioner. I don't know what the trigger was but it has given me a mission to work on all the triggers and make the teens and parents aware in that in whatever way I can.To all the people out who are there spreading their voice on #suicideawareness or #depression , I am there with the memories of my deceased daughter #Aakanksha. My dear sona, I promise you I won't be stopped by any obstacle this time. I know you are with me Kanchhu.Let's stand for each other and be the shoulder for each other.

As I dive into Ken Stearns book, I’ve come away with this conclusion. Every societal and world problem has its roots in Anger, Hatred, Forgiveness and Acceptance. It’s all about Trauma.Addiction, depression, suicide, homelessness, war, violence, the breakdown of the family, all about unresolved Trauma. One only need look out world leaders playing out their own personal unresolved trauma on the world stage. School yard bullies who never dealt with their issues. This book and my interview with Ken has been a watershed moment. #trauma #worldleaders #watershedmoment #anger #hatred #acceptance #forgiveness #addiction #suicide #homelessness #depression #war #violence @mentalhealthchangeagents Mental Health America #mentalhealth

Most of us can understand that art provides an escape to a sometimes harsh reality, but where does art’s healing potential come from? It impacts the state of our minds: Enjoying emotional stability is largely about taking responsibility for how we feel.Research has shown the power of meditation and the science behind it. One of the reasons it is so powerful is that it fosters acceptance. Creating art is a type of meditation, an active training of the mind that increase awareness and emphasizes acceptance of feelings and thoughts without judgment and relaxation of body and mind.Send me a message or comment to sign up.#art #spirituality #meditation #creativity #creativeindustries #stress #anxiety #depression #mentalhealth

I'm aware that I'm currently in a #depression episode.As I always have done, I'll keep going with my day to day - work, workouts, being present with my wife, getting outdoors where I can, doing the things that don't bring me joy now, but have done in the past, and will do so again.What I am doing differently this time, is not keeping quiet when something triggers an angry/bitter response.I used to - I'd break my teeth for how hard I'd bite my tongue just so "peace could be kept."I'm 36yrs old, and I'm finally beginning to understand that, in keeping everyone else's peace, I sacrificed my own.Sometimes, anger, bitterness, frustration teach the best lessons - that not everyone gets to have your experience, that life isn't an easy ride for everyone, and that that's rarely an individual's "fault", that, rather than judging without knowledge, you should listen, and advise into the situation as you've just been told about it.#mentalhealth

What you should know about DEPRESSION (PART 1)Taffi, a mother of two beautiful girls, happily married in her early forties, was on her way to an event one day when a young lady from nowhere deliberately ran across her path for her car to hit her.She hooted and stopped suddenly.Thank God she is not the speedy kind of driver, and coupled with the fact that it just stopped raining, she needed to drive cautiously on the road.The lady didn't feel unconscious or remorseful; rather, she was ranting painfully.Why don't you kill me? I want to die! Why now? You don't even know how to drive. I should have gone for a badass driver and not you, tortoise.Passersby were even saying, "This lady is not normal; you better leave."The lady was weeping continuously. "Oh, my God, I am tired of this life," she said. Hitting hard on the vehicle.Taffi came out of the car and asked her, "What's really the matter?"Look at you, a beautiful and attractive lady with all the numerous blessings, like the way you speak and your beautiful skin and hair texture—in fact, you are naturally endowed.The moment the lady heard these words, she gazed into her eyes for a few seconds and said, "Are you an angel or God?" Are you sure it's me you just described?I have never heard such kind words spoken to me before.The weekend is here, make sure you have enough time to rest.I am rooting for you💕💕.I am a creative health writer, women's health enthusiast and a skilled researcher.I am available to gigs, research roles and collaborations.#depression #depressionawareness #mentalhealth #storytelling #socialsaturday #bvlcrockslinkedin #delightsome

The dance accompanied with music is now known as aerobic exercises in the Western World.In India, it is a part of the religious rituals.The program lasted for 3 hours and the depression, worry melted away ; giving way to joy and bliss.Indians, too, are affected by depression and mental ill health. The category is limited to rich, MNC employees who believe in privacy and do not share their problems and feelings with others.Such organisations provide a platform to vent your frustrations, pent up emotions, personal problems.When you leave such events, you feel light hearted and full of energy to face the world. #privacy #india #share #events #music #energy #health #areobicexercises #depression #mentalhealth #joy #bliss

#TigerLeadershipPerspectiveGreat Leaders are those who #Empower, #Facilitate & #Enable their teams to become successful. They have the knack of realizing the #TruePotential of each team member & #motivate their teams to reach & try to exceed their potential, thereby achieving #ContinuousGrowth upwards in their #skills & #capabilities. As a result, employees are #SelfMotivated & #ThoroughlyEngaged, leading to #HigherEmployeeSatisfaction & resultant #HigherCustomerSatisfaction.#MicroManagement is the biggest #LeadershipPitfall & it is a tell tale sign of a #WeakLeader who is a #ControlFreak to satisfy his #Intrinsic #FearOfFailure. They are primarily #Indecisive, #NonInclusive, #WorkingInSilos & perpetually burdened with ills of #Procastination & #RiskAverseMentality. They are generally seen as #ChampionsOfStatusQuo & inhibit #Innovation & #OutOfTheBoxThinking. As a result, teams under Micro Managers are saddled with #HighEmployeeDissatisfaction, #LackOfSelfRespect, #HighlyDisengaged & #LaidBackAttitude characteristics. They will be lacking initiative, resort to #GossipMongering & overall will be detrimental to a vibrant Collaborative Office Culture. All these aspects creates a highly #ToxicEnvironment, finally leading to #Depression, #PoorMentalHealth #LowProductivity & ultimately #HighAttrition.Leadership is an Art which needs continuous efforts to move towards perfection. While very few are blessed as #BornLeaders (Less than 2%), a larger number hone up their Leadership skills #OnTheJob & #FollowingInspirationalLeaders as their #Mentors & #WellWishers. Start point of this is always the opportunity where #IndividualContributors get their first break as #TeamLeaders. That's the time, #FirstTimeManagers need to start picking the basic nuances of Leadership & develop their #ListeningSkills & ability to take #ConstructiveFeedback. They need to learn & start perfecting the #ArtOfEmpowerment & Leveraging Combined potential of their teams, converging them effectively towards achieving Team's Goals & Objectives. Gartner has listed out the Tell Tale signs to make Managers realize that they are Knowingly / Unknowingly treading the Sinful track of Micro Management.#HRLeaders should keep a close watch on such indicators & create focused Development programs for such Managers, thereby helping them overcome their Leadership Skills handicaps.#LeadershipDevelopment #LeadershipCoaching

#HassanSpeaks | #MentalHealth has been on the rise as a #concern among several #employers, #employees and their #families. Primary factors have been #stress and #depression. I once observed a conversation between 2 individuals, one asking the other how he could help them through their stress, the other responding “stop giving me stress and it’ll reduce, simple!”. This hit me. Are we becoming pawns and succumbing to amplifying stress for others unnecessarily? And adding further stress in the process deliberately? An avoidable stress is rather passed on, should this be acceptable? Are we creating and adding more mental health #pressures? We emphasize on #StressManagement, but what about those who continue to create and pass stress onward? Should we not emphasize on that as much? Do we understand the #consequences and #damage to the victim’s #social, #financial, and #physical #health? Came across this post on social media recently:What are your thoughts? Please comment and share.  #socialmedia #share #help #comment #Wellbeing #Wellness #Work #Employment #Culture #OrganizationBehavior #Management #Humanity #StopStress #NoToStress #ThinkOutsideTheBox #OutOfBoxThinking

Laughs are mandatory at Workplace ! The world keeps going through this debate about hard work and smart work. Everybody has their righteous perspectives on this. But personally, I love the smell of #hardwork. I believe that hard work itself makes a person smart. This is that one freaking tired selfie we captured, maybe around a midnight after a super hectic work day. Being a constant #creative is not an easy #job. It consumes 10 times of energy in the brain. So, to not visits the dark side of thoughts and looping in frustration, it is mandatory to #laugh like freaks at workplaces. In #psychology, this stupid idea is called "the laughing therapy". Laugh with no reason. Trust me it makes a relief on super stressful days because laughter can help reduce your #stress, #depression and #anxiety and may make you feel #happier. ANU PERERA

In fact, prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer among Lebanese men.

Has it ever happened that you woke up in the morning with a headache? Even a bright sunny day on a winter morning will irritate you. Pain in the neck can make us take irrational decisions and we cannot go very far in life with a constipated stomach.Chronic back pain or a heart problem can severely limit career choices for people and a frozen shoulder can make us stay awake in pain for the entire night and impact our productivity for the next day.We think diabetes is a physical problem but the lack of energy and motivation that comes with it tells a different story.The kind of uncertainty that a cardiovascular disease creates can put people on the brink of depression.Our bodies can be our best friend or worst enemy. We cannot completely cure our body unless we dare to listen to its needs and learn to ignore the cravings of our minds.Regular practice of Yoga makes us aware of our bodily needs and helps us stabilize our minds. Let’s include some form of Yoga in our daily life as it can be transformative to our mind and body which is very difficult to achieve through normal exercise.#dailyyoga #yogapractice #cardiovasculardisease #depression #mind #rusticwisdomin #rusticwisdomcommunity

On the other side ...There's a lot of stigma attached to depression but there's no denying the fact that life f@#$*s all - nobody dies a virgin :p So at some point it is inevitable that you will face some setbacks and feel very low, not be yourself and maybe lose all hope. Well I was there at one point and it took me sometime to get out of that. I remember that time my friend suggested that I start doing something that I love doing and interested me and I was shocked to discover that however much I tried to think - there wasn't a single thing i felt interested to do that would make me feel happy. It was as if I had forgotten myself. And this is when I am considered to be quite an interesting person always upto something (now, and used to be, but not at that point :p )It's then that I started reading more on this and one suggestion I liked was to think about your childhood and what used to give you joy, what did you enjoy doing, and do that. Now, I used to spend most of my time outdoors in nature after school and loved trees, reading, creating things with my hands and also early morning walks which I started around class 9th. So I decided to restart walking in a park which has beautiful old trees and landscapes and slowly and gradually it started a domino effect and I was able to heal with nature spending time alone and doing what I loved doing. If you're in similar situation, do try and remember your favourite childhood activity and start doing something associated with that and dheeme dheeme, you'll be out and about - back to hope and feeling internal peace and happiness, the Nirvana everyone searches for but few reach in their lifetime.#selfesteem #depression #confidence#happiness #peace #healing

Always love a good debate and this is sure to get some comments coming through.Why is it that you can have #euthanasia for physical disorders but mental disorders and #mentalillness is specifically excluded as a justification?I am not advocating a view either way but I highlight it as yet another way that #depression and mental illness in general are not seen as equivalent to physical ailment’s. Why is this even important you may ask? Well because it creates and perpetuates #stigma and that then prevents people talking about it and seeking help because they feel ashamed about.

INSIGHTS INTO GRIEF We lost our son, Tom (20), in a motorcycle accident in May 2022I’m now firmly on the grief curve Part of my challenge is understanding where I am in the troughAm I at the start of the trough or near the bottom? (I’m somewhere in the yellow circle)It’s getting worse each day, each week - not better How far / long do I have to go before the up turn and starting to feel better?Right now, I cannot see light at the end of the tunnel. Not even the faintest of glimmers All is dark If you know somebody grieving, the worst thing you can do is aggravate them, blaming them for not recovering sooner, being overly expectant or demandingIf you know somebody grieving, hold their hand on their journey through the darkness.

After suffering from PPD, my husband had never gone through the experience of someone going through pregnancy, post partum recovery let alone post partum. He honestly did the best he could and after being able to identify what I needed most, he was able to offer with an open mind and open heart, unquestionably, exactly what I needed and asked for. He’d hear me out. He offered me the most powerful tool he could ever give, listening. A good friend of mine who also has endured so much, tells me this every time, “I might not be able to tell you the right thing to do, but I’m always here to listen”, and it means the world every time she says it to me. I too offer the same for anyone who is suffering and going through something difficult. I’m not a professional therapist, but I’m a great listener.   #experience #ppd #postpartum #depression #listen #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #support

I have had and do have a great life which at times made me feel guilty for having depression when others had been through far worse that I. In my experience falling into a state of depression usually doesn’t have a reason or specific trigger…it just happens. This makes it incredibilly hard as it can happen in the space of minutes or you might go to sleep on top of the world but wake up depressed.

Only half?This figure is low. Very low. I know because these mothers (and fathers) are my clients and I hear about this and far more continuously. That they trust me to share their incredibly personal work/life realities raising their neurodiverse children so I can help them help their struggling children is an honor.Mothers (and yes, fathers as well) raising children and teens with autism are living the life of an "exceptional caregiver" which I define as caregiving on steroids. Or living at the edge.The needs are complex, crises often define daily life, and the search for resources and support is ongoing.Supporting the mental health needs of employees is a priority and employers play a pivotal role in helping to support these needs when it comes to working parents raising neurodiverse children.Financial assistance for therapies, school costs, evaluations, tutoring, at-home respite care, specialized childcare...the list is long and changes frequently. And the costs stretch families beyond what most understand.Family forming supports are wonderful and employers providing financial and other assistance and services in this arena are truly top companies. We need to also know and remember that "family functioning" supports are just as important if not moreso.#autism #neurodiversity #mothers #workingmothers #workingparents #caregiving #caregivers #worklife #mentalhealth #depression #families #employers #companies #employees

WHY MANY PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY DEPRESSED.Nearly 80% of the people we encounter are in some form of depression.Many of them take antidepressants for months and years.The fact is that common methods that are designed to combat depression do not take into account the energy metabolism factor of the brain, its acid-base balance.With the advent of new instrumental techniques, for example, neuroenergetic mapping (they are more than 30-40 years old), which provide us with information about the energy metabolism of the brain in real time, it has become possible to obtain information about the acid balance of the brain.This allows specialists in health-improving methods, doctors to select correction methods that normalize the energy metabolism of the brain.All changes - biochemical, physiological, psychological - can be controlled by an instrumental method online.DURING DEPRESSION, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON TO OVERCOME DISEASES.Therefore, in order to maintain your health, quickly and effectively cope with diseases, you need to BRING THE ENERGY OF THE BRAIN (OUR BODY'S MAIN COMPUTER) TO NORMAL STATE.ENERGIZE AND MAINTAIN THE ACID-ALKALINE BALANCE OF THE BRAIN IN THE NORMAL STATE. #ENERGY #people #brain #depression

Imagine wearing a body armor everyday; there’s this heavy weight on your chest that makes it hard to move, hard to breath, and hard to get motivated to do much of anything.That is how depression feels like. This mental illness is becoming more detrimental to those who suffered from it and are unable to seek out treatment due to various reasons like accessibility and financial barriers. In addition to such issue, misdiagnosis for mental illness also raises concerns due to the side effects of antidepressants and exposure to stigmas. With the power of machine learning, imagine having a test that is quick and easy like having your temperature monitored that could reliably identify depression through voice recordings?!?To learn more, check out my medium article on how depression could be diagnosed through voice, how it works and barriers behind it!#artificialintelligence #machinelearning #depression https://lnkd.in/gCfS_yi4

I wrote this article in response to the patterns I see with my consulting clients. Therapists and psychiatrists should be more informed on what is happening. Please read and share! I also provide CE training for organizations who are interested in the topic of #deprescribing and supporting those that are withdrawing from #psychmeds."We are conditioned to believe that the medical system has all the answers to our mental & physical #health concerns. But for people taking #psychiatricdrugs & who want to come off, traditional systems may unnecessarily harm them further.In the online communities, patients find out that their strange physical and mental symptoms may be due to the medications they are taking and will see them spelled out in full detail, by other patients in the same situation as themselves. They are offered ways to cope with their symptoms, they find hope, and an exit plan off the drugs. They see success stories of patients healing and restoring their health, usually without the support of any medical professionals." #socialwork #mentalhealth #mentalillness #psychiatry #psychology #peersupport #recovery #addiction #prescribedharm #holistichealth #lifecoach #selfhelp #antidepressants #depression #anxiety #ptsd #trauma #therapy

Anxiety & Depression - You are Not ALONEWhen faced with difficulty, under pressure to perform well, or with a worry on your mind, anxiety may become evident.A majority of people are suffering from excessive anxiety, fear, terror, and panic issues in everyday situations.Here are 6 ways to tackle anxiety issues:1. Avoid alcohol & recreational drugsIf you are already facing anxiety issues then these substances can cause more or worsen Anxiety.Alcohol & drugs both are not only harmful to your body but also to your mental health.You should completely quit consuming these substances.2. 2. Stay physically activeExercise is one of the best ways to tackle your anxiety issues & improve your mood.Enhancing your mental health will help you maintain good health and get rid of anxiety problems.Start out slowly and then gradually increase the intensity of exercise3. Make sleep a prioritySleep is needed for the proper functioning of your brain.When you are sleep deprived, your brain is not able to function properly and,faces issues like reduced concentration, slower thinking, and mood swings.Sleep well for at least 8 hours.4. Eat healthy foodsYour diet is more important for your health than you think.What you eat can impact both your physical & mental health.A healthy diet that incorporates vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and fish may help reduce anxiety.5. Keep a journalMake daily journaling a habit.Monitoring your personal life can help you figure out what stresses you out and what makes you feel better.You can use this data to internally analyze your anxiety issues and tackle them with a suitable solution.6. Socialize moreI know socializing when you have anxiety issues can be intimidating but it is needed.Don't isolate yourself from your loved ones or activities you like.Talk to someone that you trust and ask for their help & support to overcome the situation.“I found that with depression, one of the most important things you can realize is that you’re not alone. You’re not the first to go through it, you’re not gonna be the last to go through it,” — Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson #mentalhealth #people #depression #overcome #anxietyawareness #awareness

Treating the body requires a holistic approach and we need be aware the impact and implication on and that have arised from #mentalwellbeing and do the medication actually work on the physical issues? I read this today: "Treating patients with medications based almost exclusively on an intake and history is rarely a comprehensive solution to a patient’s symptoms. This one-size-fits-all approach minimizes patients' individuality while focusing on a physician’s best guess as to medication treatment. Patients are unique, with numerous components that can all contribute to mental health, including nutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, gut flora problems, toxicities, chronic infections, genetic factors, and personal history. Recognizing the uniqueness of patients and providing a more comprehensive assessment and treatment is the foundation of #FunctionalPsychiatry. Inflammation is another factor that can often play a role in #mentalhealth. Studies have found elevated levels of inflammation in patients with #depression, #anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder (Fries 2019, Müller 2018, Renna 2018). When inflammation is present in patients that are struggling with depression, they are often more resistant to medication treatment (Strawbridge 2015), and treating the inflammation can yield benefits in reducing depressive symptoms. However, the latest study on treating inflammation in #treatmentresistant depression found no benefits (Hellmann-Regen 2022). In the study, minocycline, an antibiotic with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier that also possesses anti-inflammatory properties, was added to patients' stable #antidepressant regimens. While the study included patients who were all deemed “#treatment resistant,” they did not measure or check for any indication that patients actually had excess #inflammation." Full article & source James Greenblatt, MD newsletter.

Hi #ChaiTogetherCommunity💥🤭I’ve been meeting the greatest people, from all walks of life, of all ages, of all avenue perspectives. Life has been bliss, God has me aligned where I need to be at all times. Each chapter is a part in this journey I have here in flesh. It’s to be continued… but I just wanted to acknowledge how sensitive we are as beings. Each one of us, those who are transparent about their hurt to those who are seeking someone to confide in. We all hurt, we all bruise, and we all cry. I hope you find those people who are your sunshine in the times you need that extra help. You are not weak, that’s a myth. Weakness to me is the inability to be human. As long as you are thriving ethically to the standards you value with nourishment, you are doing so well. You are human. You are not judged. You are approachable. You are assertive. You are kind. You are you. I love each one of you, none of us are the same or even need to be the same. We are all here to experience this planet together, so let’s come together as a #community and help one another rise up. At the end of the day, we all need somewhere to lay our head at night and someone to hold us in all forms of love. Have a beautiful day. 🤍🧡🙏🏽Join our #FBGroup 👉🏽 https://bit.ly/3T2BsFf#ChaiTogether, #OneJourneyatatime. 💫 #CHAI. 🌟☕️🌟 #Courage, #Hope, and #Inspiration. #Peace. #Love. #Harmony. #MentalHealth. #Joy. #Happiness. #Sadness. #BrainHealth. #Depression. #Support. #Unity. #HumanLife. #Sustainability. #Art. #Sun. #Death. #Journey.

Has it ever happened that you woke up in the morning with a headache? Even a bright sunny day on a winter morning will irritate you. Pain in the neck can make us take irrational decisions and we cannot go very far in life with a constipated stomach.Chronic back pain or a heart problem can severely limit career choices for people and a frozen shoulder can make us stay awake in pain for the entire night and impact our productivity for the next day.We think diabetes is a physical problem but the lack of energy and motivation that comes with it tells a different story.The kind of uncertainty that a cardiovascular disease creates can put people on the brink of depression.Our bodies can be our best friend or worst enemy. We cannot completely cure our body unless we dare to listen to its needs and learn to ignore the cravings of our minds.Regular practice of Yoga makes us aware of our bodily needs and helps us stabilize our minds.

Don't be afraid to take risks in life; most achievers did. People are afraid of the change because they have grown accustomed to their couch.With trepidation, the masses have been manipulated and controlled, and instead of jumping out of the swamp of fear, they are staying in the cemeteries.Be brave and leave your comfort zone; even though there is no longer a comfort zone, there is a massive prison where everyone is cuffed.Rise from the dead, leave your tangled situation, and make a difference.#life #prison #stress #depression #change #motivation #risk #fear #happiness

Losing a friend to suicide is the hardest thing a person could go through. The emptiness, the hurt, and the guilt can be unbearable. The person you used to know is gone, leaving you with nothing but memories. The pain never goes away; you learn to deal with it. You learn to live with the fact that your friend is gone and that you will never see them again.If you have lost a friend to suicide, know that you are not alone.This year I lost a friend to suicide. On his suicide note, he mentioned nothing about why he did it.We were left with so many questions.Why? How could this happen? We didn't see this coming.It was the hardest thing I have ever been through in my life. I was so hurt and so empty. I felt like I failed him, like I could have done something to prevent this.I was left with so many questions and no answers.However, I hope that someday I will understandI hope that someday the pain will go away.I hope that someday I will be able to move on.But for now, I will just hold on to the memories.And cherish the time I had with him.Here are some signs and symptoms of depression* Feeling hopeless, helpless, and worthless* Losing interest in activities that were once enjoyable* Sleeping too much or not being able to sleep* Eating too much or not being able to eat* Isolating oneself from family and friends* Feeling exhausted* Having difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or remembering things* Feeling restless or irritable* Having persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as* Having suicidal thoughtsIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms, please reach out for help.

Small behaviors amid chaos lead to the notion that those behaviors set off a chain of events over time. This relates to Chaos Theory in the scientific field. Think of the first flap of a butterfly’s wings. The first motion is change, a ripple effect. Such change is not linear in nature. The butterfly is pushing itself amidst a crossroads of remaining in its cocoon over the unknown of emergence. We do the same in our own exploration of who we are and the changes we want to make. Austin Oaks Hospital understands the courageous steps of change, as in the single flap of a butterfly’s wings. What once felt like chaos, births a new pattern of growth. Linear growth is comfortable. It is what is known. Nonlinearity is an uncomfortable stretch to challenge behavior patterns that do not align with our goals. What once felt like chaos, feels like a triumph. Call (512) 440-4800 and speak to our clinical care team about the growth you would like to make in your life.

The most ideal environment for a child to grow healthy is within a caring family environment where their parents care for each other and care for them, and to know this will never change.A person becomes prone to depression and anxiety when either one of these conditions are missing in their life. In most cases they will over-react when they perceive things aren’t going well with the relationship, and will leave rather than go through the pain of being abandoned.  The good news is there is hope when such trauma has taken place. Through counselling and therapy benefits can be healing and life transforming.Book a call now!Holistic, practical, relevant wellbeing program which addresses Life Ready course requirements, and provides relational skills for lasting healthy relationships.🌐 https://lnkd.in/ggbndt6y📧 approach@grassrootlevel.com.au 📱 1300 931 539  #healthyrelationships #grassrootsapproach #family #anxiety #depression

It’s easy to just give the standard answer of “good” but if someone genuinely asks then take the opportunity to be real and tell them what is going on …. good or bad. We all have our struggles in life and it can help if we are real and vulnerable instead of pretending everything is “good”.It’s amazing how early we are conditioned to this behaviour. How often does your children just say they are good? I noticed that my son started saying this answer when he was around 4yrs old!#depression #mentalhealth #mentalillness #suicide

So, I read this funny quote another day the brain is the organ that has named all the other organs and itself.

No one chooses to suffer. No one chooses to be depressed, anxious, sad or struggling. In most cases it’s from external sources that affect us deeply and push us into the depths of anguish and despair.  As we heal, we have to look at our part within it. It sounds harsh but it’s a truth that until we take hold and charge of it we sit within its denial and push ourselves further under. Recognising where you allowed, fell victim or gave up is a vital key to taking you back and being able to move onwards.  #healing #healingjourney #healingtrauma #depression #responsibility #key #suffer #anxious #anxietyrecovery #anxietyhelp #suffering

It seems like everywhere you look, psychology is talking about trauma and mental Iliness. And while it’s important to talk about these topics, it can sometimes feel like that’s all there is to psychology. 🤌🏻But the reality is that there’s so much more to psychology than just trauma and mental illness. There’s a whole other side to psychology that talks about happiness, wellbeing, gratitude, and other positive topics. This other side of psychology is often overshadowed by negative topics, but it’s just as important to talk about. Remember that there’s a whole other side to psychology that’s worth exploring! ✊🏻 -#psychology #mentalhealth #therapy #mentalhealthawareness #anxiety #motivation #psychologist #mentalhealthmatters #depression # #psychologyfacts #mindset #wellness #meditation #inspiration #mentalillness #mind #therapist

HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ART AS THERAPY?  🖼 I went to see the Van Gogh immersive experience and it’s a new and interesting way of viewing an artists work that I’ve seen before in a different format using VR and film projections. In fact at one point I felt so relaxed and soothed by watching the projections that I nearly fell asleep! 🖼 Ironically, Vincent was probably dealing with many forms of mental distress including what may now be pathologised as bipolar, mood or personality disorder, depression, alcohol abuse and possibly psychosis. Sadly, he was not given much credit for his work until after his death. 🖼 Being creative was obviously an outlet for his emotional tensions although paradoxically caused tensions at other times. 🖼 Like other forms of therapy, art expression can serve as a vessel for us to make sense of the world and ourselves in a different way. 🖼 As an ex Art teacher I use creative forms of expression as tools with clients and in workshops to enable a different sort of connection. #artastherapy #arttherapy #vangoghimmersive #vangoghVR #vangogh #filmprojection #relaxedandsoothed #mentaldistress #bipolar #mooddisorder #personalitydisorder #depression #psychosis #creativity #creativeoutlet #emotionaltensions #artexpression #artteacher #connection #psychotherapy

Background: Hepatitis C is one of the most challenging viral infections worldwide. Patients with hepatitis C may experience some disease-related stigma.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate perceived stigma and its role in predicting anxiety, depression, and quality of life among patients with hepatitis C.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted in behavioral counseling centers of three cities, i.e., Khorramabad, Boroujerd and Noorabad, located in the western part of Iran, from May to August 2019. Stratified multistage sampling was used to select 144 patients diagnosed with hepatitis C. The WHOQOL-BREF Scale, Stigma Impact Scale (SIS), Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory, Second Edition (BAI) were used to collect the data. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the association of covariates on stigma and quality of life. The Stata 16 software was used to analyze the data at the significance level of 0.05.Results: The mean perceived stigma was 66.805 ± 1.291 with social rejection and social isolation achieving the highest scores (23.409 ± 0.551, 20.208 ± 0.437). In the multivariate regression model, depression (B=0.7, 95%; CI: 0.5, 0.89) and anxiety (B=0.21, 95%; CI: 0.02, 0.41) had direct significant associations with stigma independent of age, sex, marital status, and occupation. Depression (B=-0.27, 95%; CI:-0.47, -0.07), anxiety (B=-0.33, 95%; CI: -0.5, -0.16), and stigma (B=-0.41, 95%; CI: -0.56, -0.26) were inversely associated with patients’ quality of life.Conclusion: This study found a high perceived stigma score among HCV patients. Depression and anxiety were significantly associated with stigma. The quality of life of HCV patients were inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stigma scores. #Stigma, #Anxiety, #Depression, #HepatitisC, #Qualityoflife

🌟Start here - cultivating a strong, loving and compassionate relationship with yourself. 💚This will set the foundations for how you navigate through life. It will set the stage for your relationships with others.🙌It took me a very long time to discover this. I wish they taught it in schools!  It's like gold dust. A hidden treasure I never knew existed. I spent much of life feeling misunderstood, unseen and unheard. This meant people pleasing, perfectionism, denying the truth of who I am, self-rejection...ultimately leading to depression, anxiety and burning out.  At the root of it all? I didn't understand, hear or see myself! 💥 That was 5 years ago.  I've never felt more like me than I do today.  It feels pretty good to say the least!   - Where and when do you feel misunderstood? - Do you feel unheard? Unseen? - Do you find yourself saying yes to others when you wish you could say no? - Are you constantly striving for a perfection you never seem to achieve? - Do you often feel not good enough or like you're not living the right life for you? - Do you feel like you're always trying to 'fit in'?If you can relate, if you're feeling lost and confused , get in touch for a free discovery call.  I now share with clients the tools & techniques I learned on my journey. One-to-one coaching & mentoring to discover the truth of who you are and restore vitality and joy.Powerful transformations are possible when you choose you - it just takes that first courageous step. It just takes saying YES to yourself 🙌Book a call here: https://lnkd.in/enqvjPDT#selfdiscovery #vitalitynaturally #transformation #perfectionism #peoplepleasing #burnout #depression #anxiety #betruetoyou #relationships

Here is my book Awaken to a new world - my journey from surrender to sovereignty.  I wrote this book throughout 2020.  I was intuitively guided to write it for the times we are in now as we go through huge shifts in human consciousness.   It was written for energetically sensitive mothers of energetically sensitive children.  I share my story of awakening and being an aware and highly sensitive child whilst sadly taking the route of numbing out through addiction most of my life.  I share with you how you can awaken from a life time of depression, addiction and anxiety.

Being around  🦜birds is linked to lasting mental health benefitshttps://lnkd.in/dy6DDnqMNew research from King's College London has found that seeing or hearing birds is associated with an improvement in mental wellbeing that can last up to eight hours.This improvement was also evident in people with a diagnosis of depression -- the most common mental illness worldwide -- indicating the potential role of birdlife in helping those with mental health conditions.Senior author, Andrea Mechelli, Professor of Early Intervention in Mental Health at Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, IoPPN, King's College London, King's College London said: "The term ecosystem services is often used to describe the benefits of certain aspects of the natural environment on our physical and mental health. However, it can be difficult to prove these benefits scientifically. Our study provides an evidence base for creating and supporting biodiverse spaces that harbour birdlife, since this is strongly linked with our mental health. In addition, the findings support the implementation of measures to increase opportunities for people to come across birdlife, particularly for those living with mental health conditions such as depression."#TiMEDaily #TogetherThroughTiME #birds #mentalhealth #planetaryhealth #biodiversity #wellbeing #depression #health

This morning I stumbled upon a post from someone with whom I have a good relation, talking about psychological and mental pressure we all can have during times of our professional lives AND family lives too. I´m sharing dream indie pop today for such issues, since I´ve always had them close and find it easy to write about heartfelt topics. Mental illness is everywhere, periodic, or permanent but invisible most of the times. It´s fantastic to share on social media, since so many people feel less alone seeing there are many out there feeling the same.

Is your relationship toxic or are you just in a rough patch?Get my FREE 10-page Report - https://lnkd.in/eSVz7Bju7 Common Warning Signs of a Toxic Relationship to help you understand and navigate your relationship, examine where it is and make the right choices for you and your partner. You can You Spot The Red Flags In Your Relationship....It's a hard pill to swallow at times to admit that there are red flags in our relationship. And so, as a defense mechanism, we often don't allow ourselves to see them until it's too late. Being able to spot them is important though, as they can help avoid heartache and staying in a dysfunctional relationship longer than you need to, or indeed start one! Most people in toxic relationships know their relationships aren’t ideal, but they justify and rationalize their doubts away. Normalization makes them feel, “this is not so bad, and they promised to change….” and they hang in there way too long.But you don't need to stay stuck.It's time to identify those signs. You’ll be SO relieved to be moving on from the current relationship routines and patterns that make you so unhappy. There is amazing LOVE on the other side... all you need to do is take the first step to getting there!Click the link below/in my bio to get your copy of my FREE 10-page report Now!: Click the Link > https://lnkd.in/eSVz7BjuBecause It's Time - to Create the Life You Desire & to Have the Love You Deserve!

Are we in a recession or the beginning of a depression❓Share your opinion below 👇👇👇https://lnkd.in/eB5rBbKW #opinion #share #recession #depression #beginning #shareyouropinion
-----------------------------
So, empathy. Let's take a look at these 4 so-called 'types':1) 'Understanding': 'I know that being depressed is difficult.' How would you feel if you were depressed and someone said that to you? To me as a person with cyclical depression, it sounds cold and unfeeling. It could be well-intentioned. Perhaps the person does actually know it's hard. It does not sound like they know, for one, and knowing something is hard is frankly pretty meaningless. 'I see your leg is falling off. That must hurt.' No sh** Sherlock.2) 'Feeling': 'I'm thinking about you.'Again, like 1, this is not empathy. It is not as cold. Is it feeling? Maybe? It depends what the person is thinking. Are they thinking it must be cool to be in your shoes, and they are jealous? Are they thinking you are interesting like a bug under a microscope? Or are they thinking you are hurting, and they feel hurt too?Very unclear, as thinking is literally on the face of it different from feeling.3) Caring: 'I'm here to listen if you want to talk about it.' Said honestly and sincerely, with compassion, this is one of the most empathetic things you can do for a person who is suffering. But again, you have to mean it, and if they do talk, you have to listen with full attention and empathy. By the way, this is extremely difficult for most people to do well.4) 'Doing' - it is a given that you cannot cure their depression so why say that? Does that help or does it just make you feel better? Committing to be there every Saturday to walk with them seems very selfless on the surface. But let's drill down. First, you have decided for the depressed person walking once a week will help (they may not want or need this). Second, you have decided (based on your own availability I'm guessing?) that Saturdays are the day walking with you will happen. Saturdays may be always, mostly, or occasionally the worst days for the depressed person - the one you are trying to help. Right? Third, the pressure is on for the depressed person. You are magnanimously making yourself available every week for them. So if they can't see you that day, or can't manage the walk, now they get to feel even worse about themselves because they have let you down, on top of everything else they are messing up every day.So basically this list, again, I am sure well-intentioned, is 1 for 4, maybe, depending on how present and genuinely compassionate you can be when listening.Sorry. That is a big fail, IMO. Not close to empathy. #people #help #empathy #fail #depression #complexity #complextrauma #compassion #presence #listening

Dissociation is one way the mind copes with too much stress, such as during a traumatic event. Experiences of dissociation can last for a relatively short time (hours or days) or for much longer (weeks or months). If you dissociate for a long time, especially when you are young, you may develop a dissociative disorder.Connect with our experts and #LetUsTalkFor more info, Feel free to call 📞 +91 98104 11093#mentalwellness #mentalcheckup #mentalwellbeing #mentalhealthexperts #mentalhealth #mentalhealthsupport #mentalhealthisimportant #depression #kanchanrai #balance #selfcare #life #stressors #mentalhealthmatters #connectnow #lut #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthrecovery #psychosis #psychosisawareness #psychosisrecovery #psychosisproblems #psychosispositivity

Thoughts can affect our perceptions, judgments, experiences, and ultimately our reality. It's okay to have negative thoughts from time to time, but too many can negatively affect our mental health and self-esteem. Many times, our thoughts keep us stuck in the past, are very harsh on ourselves, negatively impact our mental and physical health, and prevent us from reaching our full potential. Letting go of or challenging negative thoughts are great ways to boost self esteem and confidence. Next time you have a negative thought, try challenging it. Some simple but effective ways to do this are by asking yourself "Is this true?" or "How do I know this is true?" By doing this you can come up with a more realistic thought or identify where you are being too hard on yourself.Positive affirmations are also a helpful tool for challenging or letting go of negative thoughts. Remind yourself that your thoughts do not speak to your character or define you as a person. ...#negativethinking #thought #thoughtoftheday #thoughts #positivethinking #mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthsupport #selflove #selflovequotes #selfcare #selfcaretips #selfloveclub #therapy #depression #depressionhelp #anxiety #anxietyawareness #anxietyrelief #anxietyhelp #anxietyrecovery #apartmenttherapy #trauma #traumahealing #traumainformed #telehealthcare #psychologytoday #californiatherapy

Functions such as heartbeat, breathing, and digestion are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It transmits information from the internal organs and operates automatically.The autonomic nervous system is made up of parasympathetic nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system. As your sympathetic nervous system activates your body's "fight-or-flight" response, your parasympathetic nervous system facilitates digestion and rest.Since traumatized individuals are often on high alert and more sensitive to threats, their sympathetic nervous system is more likely to be activated by stress, danger, or physical activity. This constant state of alert leads to difficulties sleeping, difficulties concentrating, irritability, anger, panic, constant anxiety, and other symptoms. The following activities can help you calm your nervous system and decrease activation.  ...#nervoussystem #fightorflight #calm #therapytips #autonomicnervoussystem #mentalhealth #mentalhealthadvocate #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthsupport #selflove #selflovequotes #selfcare #selfcaretips #selfloveclub #therapy #depression #depressionhelp #anxiety #anxietyawareness #anxietyrelief #anxietyhelp #anxietyrecovery #apartmenttherapy #trauma #traumahealing #traumainformed #telehealthcare #psychologytoday #californiatherapy

Some antidepressants may cause problems if you have certain mental or physical health conditions. On the other hand, certain antidepressants may help treat other physical or mental health conditions along with depression. For example, many antidepressants may relieve symptoms of anxiety disorders. Bupropion may help you stop smoking. Other examples include using duloxetine to help with pain symptoms or fibromyalgia, or using amitriptyline to prevent migraines.Make an appointment 📅 with me today to discuss your options when it comes to improving your health!  https://bit.ly/GHHcall#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #anxiety #love #mentalhealthmatters #depression #motivation #health #wellness #mindfulness #healing #fitness #life #loveyourself #therapy #inspiration #happiness #mindset #positivity #positivevibes #meditation #mentalillness #psychology #wellbeing #happy

My strongest love language is quality time with my people and that bucket needs to be filled!3.

It was an honor to be a part of Lisa MacDonald's mental health runway show. This video is dedicated to the millions of people affected by mental illness. I hope that our communities & organizations continue to recognize & spread awareness, education and advocacy for a better crisis response system; developing resources for youth and young adults; updating our educational materials to better address the needs of underrepresented communities. While World Mental Health Day only happens once a year, it’s now more important than ever to re-evaluate your overall efforts around positive mental health and breaking the stigma.🎥: ALEMedia#ALEMedia #MentalHealth #mentalhealthrunwayshow #runwayshow #art #motivation #weareunity #togetherness #selfcare #selflove #anxiety #mentalhealthmatters #depression #motivation #health #wellness #breakthestigma

Researchers examined data from 26,239 individuals in the UK Biobank and discovered that those with obesity-related liver stress, inflammation, or kidney stress had the greatest adverse effects in their brains.“Dementia is a debilitating disease that affects more than 55 million people worldwide,” Dr. Lumsden says.“Understanding metabolic factors and profiles associated with dementia-related brain changes can help identify early risk factors for dementia. In this research, we found that adverse neuroimaging patterns were more prevalent among people who had metabolic types related to obesity. These people also had the highest Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) –how much energy your body requires when resting in order to support its basic functions – but curiously, BMR seemed to contribute to adverse brain markers over and above the effects of obesity.”Senior Investigator, UniSA’s Professor Elina Hyppönen says the finding presents a new avenue for understanding brain health.“This study indicates that metabolic profiles are associated with aspects of brain health. We also found associations with many individual biomarkers which may provide clues into the processes leading to dementia,” Prof Hyppönen says.“The human body is complex, and more work is now needed to find out exactly why and how these associations arise.”Sloth MD supplements target #liverstress #metabolicbalance therefore #brainhealth *Reference: “Metabolic profile-based subgroups can identify differences in brain volumes and brain iron deposition” by Amanda L.

Equine Therapy - I often wonder what people think of my passion for horse racing being the animal lover that I am and shamanic practitioner too, where the spirit of animals in particular the horse is so dear to me and carries such meaning. However in this one story this weekend whilst watching the world championship of horse racing 'The Breeders Cup', this year in Keenland, USA, I defy anyone not to shed a tear or a bucket when you hear and see of this story, of man or boy's connection to the horse. If you have ever engaged in equine therapy where the horse is the therapist then you will know that what is being illustrated here is true. It would seem however that both boy and horse are better in the togetherness of their connection. It is stories like this of Cody Dorman and the horse named after him Cody's Wish that have the power to change our world forever because they pang at our heart strings so deeply that we are arguably touched forevermore by that experience. I won't say any more today I shall just place this link here for you to see for yourselves. The story has an even happier ending with Cody's Wish winning last night in an epic finish to win one of the most coveted prizes in the sport of horse racing, a win at The Breeders Cup!!. Great things can happen, things can work out, we can have joy, and fun and happiness and amazing celebrations too. 😀🥲😍🏇🏇🏇https://lnkd.in/ev7xqGwF#natureconnection #equinetherapy #horseracing #triumph #adversity #mensmentalhealth #menshealth #depression #shamanism #adversity #adversechildhoodexperiences

Let's have some fun for a minute. I have a question for you...Tell me...Who is the alter ego of Clark Kent?Take your time to think about it...If you are like all people I asked thisquestion before, you probably answered......'Superman!' Right?(By the way my top superhero.)But...That is not the right answer. Realize,that being Superman is the guy's nature. His natural state is being a superman...Actually 'Clark Kent' is the alter egoof Superman.And... this is how most of us live...We have great potential, great superpowers,which are our natural state...our nature. But we are living most of our lives in our alter ego of someone, who is weak, who is suffering......thinking that that is who we are.Mistaking our alter ego, with our natural state...Life is so precious. I help people to come back to their natural state... to be alive again,using their full potential.I believe that helping people realize thetruth behind their true nature is the bestway I can make a difference in the world...That's why I want to invest my time and effortin you, so you can leave your alter ego, andstart living a real life... the one you alwaysdesired.Hit comment, and tell me what is resonatingin you right now... or... even better...Let's have a call...I offer a free online session... just make an appointment here...https://lnkd.in/ej-eKw9k...and show up.

How do you find it? Is it an adventure for you? Are you having fun? How can you help others in just a few seconds of your time? It's easier than you think.I hope this video and Episodes 1-5 are helping you in your journey. Remember to share you own stories with others. Perhaps you'll help many others through your testimony, maybe even some who are thinking about giving up. Be a LIGHT in their life.I am a Life Coach and we'll go through the book in the next 9 episodes. Check out my book at the link below and join the journey.

#SOLUTION TO #WORRY -Small story about Buddha and his disciples:One day Buddha arrived for his usual morning discourse with his disciples. He had a knotted handkerchief in his hand. He showed the handkerchief to the disciples and asked if any of themcould come up and untie the knot. One disciple went up and tried to untie it. He pulled and pulled and the knot tightened. Another disciple went up, he looked at the knot for a few seconds and easily untied it. All he did was look at the knot and immediately he knew how the knot was made in the first place. So, he just reversed the whole thing and untied it! The knot itself taught him how to untie it. In life worries are the knots in the handkerchief. If we look at them with awareness, we will know how to dissolve them. We will see exactly how the worry was created and then know how to ‘untie’ it. The worry itself will teach us how to release it. First of all, there is no need to worry. Life itself holds all the solutions. It is a beautiful self-sustaining mechanism. We just need to allow it to function in its natural way. Then we will awaken to its higher intelligence and drop all our worries. Not only that, when we witness, our mind slows down. Worry itself causes the mind to rush around in what you call anxiety. When awareness is brought in, the rushing slows down and things happen as they should.#anxiety #LIFE #stress #frustration #anger #depression #nithyananda #kailasa

People wave and smile at soon as they see him, and he stops and talks with at least 10 people before he finally reaches his destination. He orders his coffee and baklava and sits down at the empty table and opens his laptop with a picture of him and his girlfriend Ayse, the one that truly knows him. Mustafa is a social butterfly, someone that can adjust himself depending on the situation and the people he spends time with. He has used his social skills to connect with the right people, the ones that have helped him become a well-known journalist and now a member of a well-known company.  𝐈𝐧-𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫, 𝐈 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐲 𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫He has struggled with depression for periods of his life, moments that forced him to learn to see the bright side of life. Writing was his way of dealing with his thoughts and emotions, but he never once thought that he would be working as a journalist, but after all, he is one the best writers accordingly to himself. He sips on his coffee and doesn’t notice Ayse that sneaks up on him and gives him a kiss on the cheek. She buys herself a coffee before she sits down next to Mustafa and puts her head on his shoulder. He continues writing his article about men's health, and the importance of being a man by your own definition. He loved arguing with people in person and online about the importance of men in our modern society. Mustafa had often feared being disliked by people, but he once interviewed a person that made him fall in love with the fire of hate. He once said, sticks and stones may break my bones but there will always be something to offend a feminist. He later on understood that it’s better to be silent than to express a joke that can be taken in the wrong way.Business Inquiries: 2universe97@gmail.com     #2UNIVERSE #Mindset #positivity #Reflecting #Life #knowingyou #Selective #Outside #People #Love #Gemini #depression #Journalist #Article #writer #society #healing #Experiences #Perspectives #Businessman #Digitalmarketing #Branding #Marketing #opentowork #Istanbul #Türkiye #business

Suffering from frozen a shoulder?🌿 Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms usually appear gradually and then worsen.

How to support someone with anxietyMessages and words to comfort your loved onesSometimes it is hard to know exactly what to say to support someone with anxiety. Your loved one just need a little more patience and care from your side, you will see how beautifully they will bloosom at their own speed. If you are new to this, it can be overwhelming. Try to remember these things as you support someone with anxiety:1. Provide validation2. Express concern3. Do not force confrontation “I am always here for you, what can I do to help?”Instead of saying,“Are you OK??”(For the 100th time)Ask them, “do you want to leave and go for a little walk?”“Be patient with yourself, healing takes time and strength. You are doing much better than you think.”“I know anxiety makes you overthink and doubt everything. Please remember not to question how I feel about you, I care.”“If spending time with a large group of people makes you anxious, I’d love to do something with just the two of us.” Did this help?Save this post for later and don’t forget to share it with your friend.    LearnMahakriyaBook an appointment+91 72111 66626 Shiva Life Coach #LearnMahakriya#shivalifecoach #healing #miracles #depressionhelp   #heal #mentalhealth #anxiety #anxietyhelp #anxietyrelief  #anxietyattack #anxietyrecovery #anxietyfree #care #anxietysupport #depressionhelp #depression #anxietyanddepression #anxietymanagement

Did you know that awful feeling you sometimes have is your #intrinsicidentity 's way of saying you've moved away from who you are at your core?Some people call it #disengagement - others call it #depression Suppression of your #intrinsicmotivation is not good for you. You were born to contribute to the world by sharing your #intrinsicvalue and you can only do this by gaining a deep understanding of yourself.We are not taught this in school because at the root of western education systems there is a linear focus to get us ready for a world that puts #profitfirst  instead of #peoplebeforeprofits We have to make a living yet this only satisfies our extrinsic needs when we are unable to match how we contribute to the world with our  #intrinsic nature.The results speak for themselves.Individuals and teams who are recognised for their intrinsic talents and strengths are more engaged and more likely to get into what Mihaly Csikszentmihaly termed Flow - a state where we are highly motivated and engaged in activities and contributions. Here we have a positive relationship to our roles and environments. If you'd like to discover more about how you might shake off that awful feeling of dread, what some people term 'monday morning blues' and swap this out for #mondaymorningmotivation get in touch and lets have a chat : https://lnkd.in/esj8rU88

If you go to a trained psychiatrist, their first line of action will be to set you up on a regular schedule of cognitive-behavioral therapy and perhaps a medication that can help balance the chemicals in your brain.

Unfortunately, there is no one treatment that works for everyone, and most people need a combination of strategies to keep their mood steady throughout different stages of life.

Each person has his/her own body’s chronotype, a biological clock that dictates their body on when to sleep or when to wake up.Based on this, there are two types of people– the early birds and the night owls. But, which group is more healthy?Based on research, early risers had a 12-27% lower risk of developing depression whereas night owls had a 6% higher risk of developing it. Night owls also have an increased predisposition to developing hypertension and obesity as compared to early risers.So, it is better to be an early riser than a night owl in the long term.Read on to understand more about your sleep cycle and tips to adopt healthy sleep habits - https://lnkd.in/dXxu_YBF#xcodelife #genetics #genes #health #wellness #video #DNA #sleep #sleepcycle #sleepiness #chronotype #biologicalclock #earlybirds #nightowls #depression #hypertension #obesity #sleephealth #sleephabits #health #wellness #saturdayvibes #saturdaythoughts #saturdaywisdom #weekendread #weekendmotivation #dailypost #dailynutrition #dailytips #dailyupdates #dailymotivationKirtika Singh Zack Magerman

Compassionate Treatment for Bipolar Disorders At Awakenings Treatment Center, we address bipolar disorders with a multi-faceted treatment approach.Bipolar disorders are brain disorders that cause unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out daily tasks.There are four basic types of bipolar disorder; all of them involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods range from periods of significantly “up,” elated, and energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very sad, “down,” or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes.Learn more http://ow.ly/Tbm250Lv99qIf you or a loved one is struggling with any of the symptoms listed above, call us for a consultation: 855-717-3268#bipolar #bipolardisorder #mentalhealth #mentalillness #mentalhealthtreatment #bipolarawareness #mania #depression #mentalhealthadvocate

Some antidepressants may cause problems if you have certain mental or physical health conditions. On the other hand, certain antidepressants may help treat other physical or mental health conditions along with depression. For example, many antidepressants may relieve symptoms of anxiety disorders. Bupropion may help you stop smoking. Other examples include using duloxetine to help with pain symptoms or fibromyalgia, or using amitriptyline to prevent migraines.Make an appointment 📅 with me today to discuss your options when it comes to improving your health!  https://bit.ly/GHHcall#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #selfcare #selflove #anxiety #love #mentalhealthmatters #depression #motivation #health #wellness #mindfulness #healing #fitness #life #loveyourself #therapy #inspiration #happiness #mindset #positivity #positivevibes #meditation #mentalillness #psychology #wellbeing #happy

As an entrepreneur, speaker, therapist, coach, and SOOO much more, I fiercely protect my time with family on #slowsundays. Why? Because...1. I don't buy into the story of a business owner needing to hustle 24/7 to be successful. That is a fast journey to Chronic Stress and Burnout. 2. My strongest love language is quality time with my people and that bucket needs to be filled!3. I made a decision to live what I teach and to serve my clients well I need to be designing an exciting life, not just following bullshit rules that crush people.And if that isn't enough...I do it because I CHOOSE IT 😍#mindfulimpact #taniadavies #successslowcoach #ceocoach #strategicallyslow #slowdown #reclaimyourlife #successintheslowlane #corporatehealth #womenentrepreneurs #womeninleadership #womeninbusiness #freedomlifestyle #busyisntbetter #busymom #busylife #happy #theslowlanesuccesssystem #rushingwomensyndrome #anxiety #depression #overwhelm #procrastination #perfectionist #subconsciousmind #overthinking

Years ago, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. More recently ADD was added to my diagnosis. During my depressive episodes, I've seen dark places, but I have never attempted suicide. However, I have experienced suicidal ideation and the pain that major episodes bring. In the past, I have been paralyzed by anxiety, but, earlier this year, it reached a new level. There were periods of time that I couldn't leave my apartment. At one point, I was stuck for two weeks. I have missed 40+ days of work and all but two have been due to anxiety and mental illness. It almost felt like my anxiety and ADHD were fighting it out and every once in a while depression would lob in a bomb. Not only has it impacted work, but, over the years, it has negatively impacted relationships (romantic, friendships, and familial). I know people who have been pill shamed. Have experienced and watch others experience the stigmas surrounding mental illnesses. Watched as people and, at least one friend, ended their pain by taking their own life. It is time to end the stigmas surrounding mental illness. Especially those surrounding men's mental health. Being depressed or having anxiety or experiencing some other mental illness does not make you weak. The stigmas prevent many men from getting help. That needs to end.Globally, the rate of suicide is alarmingly high, particularly in men. Too many men are ‘toughing it out’, keeping their feelings to themselves and struggling in silence. Movember is aiming to reduce the rate of male suicide by 25% by 2030, and I want to help them get there. Help me stop men dying too young.#mentalillnessawareness #mentalillness #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #depressionawareness #depression #depressionlife #depressionisreal #anxietyawareness #anxiety #endthestigma #endthestigmaofmentalillness #suicideprevention #suicidepreventionawareness #itsokaytotalk #mentalhealthmatters #malementalhealthawareness #malementalillness#anxietysucks #itsokaytonotbeokay #itsoktotalk #youarenotalone #itsokaytoaskforhelp #anxietylife #mentalhealthwarrior #speakup #movember #Movember2022 #movemberfoundation
