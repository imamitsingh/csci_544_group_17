After being selected to attend the National Society of Minorities in Hospitality (NSMH) National Conference 2022 in Miami, Florida, I could not contain my excitement. I didn't know what to expect or what opportunities I should be pursuing. Still, I was determined to enter the space as my full self with an open mind and an open heart. I browsed the career fair for what felt like an eternity before stopping at a table where I was engaged in the most thought-provoking conversation I had the entire time I was at the event. I knew walking away from that table that this could be a place for me to excel and ultimately, somewhere I could be happy.Fast forward to now, I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted an internship offer with General Mills for the Summer 2023 term. This couldn't have been possible without the help and support of the recruitment team (Nancy Qiu, Courtney Glotzbach, Marissa Moksnes, Lindsay Jukua), my family, friends, and God above all. Super excited for what's to come! 😆 #GeneralMillsinternlife #iworkforGenMills #acceptedoffer #excited

Bronze level activities are about trying new things, and could include one-off volunteering, casual part-time work (as a Student Ambassador, for example), or attending a session with an Employability or Enterprise Advisor. Choose 2 graduate attributes to develop, and get involved in activities!❇️ SILVER AWARDThe Silver award is about stretching yourself a bit further, developing new skills and showing a greater commitment to your activities. Choose 2 more graduate attributes to develop, and get involved in activities!

I could tell my story of all that I went through to make it to this day. However, I am not special, my obstacles might have been more tedious than others, I may have endured more than others, however, I refuse to use my struggles to define me. Everyone has obstacles they must overcome in order to gain achievement. The story I want to tell is that God is able, hardwork pays off, determination paves the way, confidence in you is strength and your super power. My story is that I did well because I am here to tell you and show you that I did. I am celebrating. I am proud of me, I'm am excited for me, I am excited for what is to come. I thank God, my family for the motivation, and especially my siblings who made sure I was taken care of each step of the way.

I am excited to be the new team member of Green Phenix and to work on combating the plastic problem.Annually, 11 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans.To make this number easier to digest: 11 Olympic swimming pools can be filled with plastic entering the ocean every hour.If current trends continue, it is expected that the oceans will contain more plastic than fish by the year 2050.We should not be at peace with this reality and do our utmost best to reduce, reuse and recycle our plastics!Green Phenix is a social enterprise that fosters a circular and inclusive economy in Curaçao. We organize shoreline clean-ups, recycle different types of plastic into new products, raise awareness about the plastic challenge, and conduct research on plastic pollution. In the recycling process, people with a distance from the labor market have the chance to (re)discover their talents and improve their quality of life.We are eager to connect, so don’t hesitate to shoot a message if you are interested or want to join our efforts!#KòrsouLimpi #PlasticPollution #Recycling #CircularEconomy #GreenPhenix #CleanOceans #Excited #NewJob

It’s been a hectic year. That feels like an understatement to be honest 😂 But in many respects - personally, professionally and for many of our colleagues and clients - it genuinely has. Having relocated our young family down to #christchurch just in time for my wife to have our 3rd (and last!) son, the past few months have definitely seen above-average levels of hectic though. PwC New Zealand - after being so supportive of the move and my ability to retain a leadership role in the CT team - has again generously provided me the opportunity to spend this special few months at home. Paternity leave has been incredible for several reasons - watching Kit, our newest member, settle into the world; seeing Liam (4) and Freddie (2) welcome a new brother with gentleness and love; and seeing my amazing wife Jess Lawson strive (and power) through a Psychology Masters thesis (while breast feeding, parenting and generally holding the rest of the house together!). Similar to 2020, I again find myself #motivated and #excited  as I get set to return to work next week. The macroeconomic outlook for 2023 is fragile (at best), financial market volatility is BACK, debt markets are starting to soften and we are continuing to make exciting investments in our people and tools to bring clients sustained value and insights. Thanks again to a remarkable effort from the Treasury and Debt Advisory team for doing my mahi and see you all next week 👍#team #pwc #parenting Alex Wondergem Brett Johanson FCA Mike Shirley Natasha Donaldson Rajeev Verma Cameron Scott Keegan Robbins Grace Lewis stephanie B.

Are you having fun yet?This week, with clients and myself, I've heard so many "shoulds."I should be better at journaling because that will help me grow.I should constantly grow so I don't get stagnant. I should stand up against opinions I don't believe because that's how we make the change.I should start posting on Instagram about my business because it's how I will get clientsI should eat fewer carbs so I can lose weight.I should be more productive in the morning so I'm more productive all day long.None of these are correct. None of these are wrong. They simply are what they are. You're doing one thing to get the other. Have you considered if you enjoy doing it?And what do you ultimately want? My guess is that it's deeper than what you're presenting.What would be available if you did things you wanted to get the result you wanted?Sounds better than putting yourself through hell, hating the process, to simply get to the other side. Enjoy the #journey. #leadership #life #coaching #fridayfeeling #excited #fun #change #business #support

Learning is amazing.Today, I learned how to sell an exterior door install.Why is this important for someone in Saas? Because I learned how to speak another customer’s language and I was able to apply my current skill set to the conversation and improve it.I am so excited to take knowledge from any sales conversation I can be a part of and add it to my skill set and apply what I already know.I’m also so grateful for Lowe's Companies, Inc. for always having my back and providing for my family during my time of transition.YES! I’m back at Lowe’s part-time and I am so proud of that.I am also excited that I’ll soon be able to give y’all the coolest news ever regarding my future in tech sales.Waiting is challenging. But when you fill it with learning, it’s worth it.What was something you learned today?#perseverance #persistence #alwayslearning #growthmindset #excited #dreamsdocometrue

There is the strongest push to #mediate your matters- great insights from Brett McGrath💪 #mediationskills : Richard Maurice- brilliant speaker - an effective way of mediation is ‘evaluative’ or ‘directive’ mediation♥ – the #mediator provides an unbiased evaluation of the pros and cons of your case at mediation✔🥇 #online and #defamation  : The Online Safety Act 2021 applies to children and adults who have been bullied, abused, harassed, and intimidated online very timely. #Defamation expert - 💪Sue Chysanthou SC💪 advises that you take a screen shot of the abuse, comments, shares as soon as you see it.  #practicemanagement: for those running a business, think about niching and even micro-niching.  There is an entire world of ‘micro-communities’ where your next clients can be found- thank you wise Sue-Ella Prodonovich Feeling #strong, #informed and #excited to keep doing and getting better!😀Jennifer Croker Sue-Ella ProdonovichRichard Maurice@ Rachel SlatKatrene HaltehAriza Arif#law #gratitude #passionandpurpose #cominosfamilylawyers

For everyone who's been sending emails and private messages asking about my #memoir, I've got an update: the book cover is nearly finalized, and Mekiya and I are really excited about the design!!! All my family members love it and have describe it to me in great detail, enabling me to visualize and love it, too. This #book is one of the biggest accomplishments of my life, alongside earning the #Fulbright and becoming a #journalist. I want to thank all my friends and loved ones because without their support, not just while working on this book, but throughout my life, I wouldn't have been able to grow into the person I am today. Even this book cover is a gift from one of my best friends, to whom I'm incredibly grateful. I look forward to sharing more updates soon!!!#writing #storytelling #LifeStory #LifeJourney #StorySharing #BookCover #BookDesign #publishing #journalism #excited #grateful #proud #friends #family #LovedOnes #support #networking #sharing #connections

#SignsOfBurnout #WhyMindy? ARM👇🏻💭 Do you remember your first day at work, how #excited you were for a new start and #opportunities, and that eagerness to do well?  ✔️ It is normal that this #enthusiasm may decrease over time, but it should never disappear and turn into #apathy or #indifference.  😏 No longer caring about the #quality of your work, how your #colleagues think of you, or whether or not tasks are completed on time, are all possible signs of #apathy.  There is simply NO PASSION, lack of emotions…  In  Mindy we explain that feelings, help to prevent them, as they are symptoms of #burnout.  🤔 And how to prevent such apathy? Answers you will find in Mindy 😉 services.💭 Հիշո՞ւմ եք Ձեր առաջին աշխատանքային օրը, որքան ոգևորված էիք նոր սկզբի և հնարավորությունների համար և ինչ եռանդով էիք լցված` աշխատանքը հնարավորինս լավ անելու: ✔️ Նորմալ է, որ ժամանակի ընթացքում այդ #էնտուզիազմը կարող է նվազել, սակայն այն երբեք չպետք է անհետանա և վերածվի #ապատիայի՝ #անտարբերության։  😏 Անտարբերության հետևանքով Դուք այլևս չեք մտածում կատարված աշխատանքի #որակի մասին, ինչ են մտածում #գործընկերները Ձեր մասին կամ արդյոք աշխատանքը ժամանակին է արվել, թե` ոչ։ Պարզապես ՀԱՎԵՍ ՉԿԱ…Բայց  Mindy-ի մասնագետներն այդ իրավիճակում ասում են ավելին` կա Հուզական այրում (#burnout)։  🤔 Իսկ ինչպե՞ս կանխել ապատիան։ Պատասխանները` Mindy 😉 ծառայություններում են  #MindyServices #mindy #burnoutprevention #burnoutsigns #burnoutovercoming

I have to admit that still after 10 months at adesso Nordics I'm sometimes amazed what all we at adesso do. This time it was research rocket software in space! 🚀"adesso SE provided the entire software infrastructure for the “Exp.007/Blofeld” experiment during the MAPHEUS-12 mission in Kiruna, Sweden. The protection of sensor data in spacecraft and in “life support systems” (ecosystems) in space is playing an ever greater role in space research. IT security and data encryption – another area in which adesso specialises – is a crucial factor here." I'm so happy to be part of this journey to grow our team in Nordics and provide also our colleagues expertise around Europe to our customers in Finland. #space #growth #excited #data #security

Finally finished my first #project, a website for our complex (https://lnkd.in/d7G_GuMX) . Fully responsive, minus the #parallax  effect that seems to be causing more issues than its worth(as soon as I fix it it breaks somewhere else). That been said, I learned quite a lot even though it was such a simple website with very little user interaction. Next step is building a management portal for the trustees to manage the trustee type stuff.*Edit* My favorite part is #integrating a #component  I made in a previous project into this one to help deal with whitespace on the home screen#react #typescript #mui #progress #excited #javascript #frontend

🧡 BIG smile this morning as I kicked off my first official day as Spare Key's Executive Director. 🧡SO much hard work and dedication has gone into the last three years at this amazing nonprofit, and I can proudly say that I can't wait for this next chapter!None of what we do EVERY SINGLE DAY for families facing a medical crisis is possible without SO many incredible individuals. From our dedicated staff of Alexia Sebesta, Angela Frazier, and Talia Simonett to our knowledgeable Board of Directors to partners, volunteers, and sponsors. I am so incredibly honored to be working with every single one of you to ensure Spare Key continues to help more families facing unimaginable medical crises "Be Seen. Be Heard. Be Found." by donors across the nation!✅ First lesson learned of the day? Post early before the day starts! I took this photo before an 8am meeting and had a plan of what I wanted to say, but my day quickly filled with amazing conversations with Board Members and Spare Key partners. Now it's 2pm and I'm finally getting around to making a post! Yet, I wouldn't have it any other way!#nonprofit #excited #dogood #executivedirector #team

This will be achieved by a specialized flowmeter providing an output signal that will allow the position of the flow control valve to be adjusted to suit the client’s required throughput.Our #experience is your peace of mind.#new #projects #excited #commitment #engineering #mining #binderplant #design #materialshandling #binder #cement #Namibia #engineering #mining #materialhandling #materialhandlingequipment #materialhandlingsolutions #miningindustry #materialshandling #materialshandlingequipment #materialshandlingsolutions #miningequipment #engineeringdesign #engineeringsolutions #innovation #sustainability #projectmanagement #mechanicalengineering #mechanical #worldofengineering #engineeringdesign #mechanical_engineering #miningengineering #tech #quality #engineering #manufacturing #technology #team #project #materialshandlingexpert #innovation #engineer #technology #design #science #manufacturing #engineers #mechanicalengineering #tech #mechanical #engineeringlife #education #industry #worldofengineering

A Tale from Africa. Tales we tell each other and from which we learn from each other. Come listen to the stories and tales!⁠⁠A man one day went hunting with his dogs, and came upon a shrew by the roadside. It said to him, "master help me across this swollen stream". He refused and was going to walk by, but the little creature entreated him again: "Do help me across this swollen stream and I will help you across yours."The man turned back, picked it up and carried it across, very reluctantly. It then disappeared from his sight, and he went on with his dogs and killed some guinea fowl. Soon it started to rain, so he took refuge in one of the little watch huts. The Shrew, which had followed him unseen, hid away in the thatch. ⁠Presently a lion came along, and thus addressed the hunter: give your guinea fowl to the dogs, let them eat the birds, you eat the dogs and then I'll eat you!⁠The man was terrified, and could neither speak nor move. The lion roared out the same words a second time. Then came a little voice out of the thatch: "Just so. Give the guinea fowl to the dogs, let them eat them, you eat the dogs, the lion will eat you, and I'll eat the lion". ⁠The lion ran away without looking behind him. ⁠⁠This and many other (life) tales will you hear during our community experiences in southern Africa. Because they are fun, they are exciting, they are special, but they are also educational.⁠#excited #talesfromafricatravel #slowtravel #immersion #tellastory #morethanatourist #communityexperiences #realpeople #realsustainable

What does it mean to perform under pressure in the work that we do?Well, what I find, cool is the interpretation of the stimuli and what happens when you're nervous, right? Your heart rate starts to go up, you know, you sort of get a little tan, you get a little sweaty, right? You have expectations of what's coming and we interpreted that as I'm nervous. Now, what the interpretation of excited, your heart rate starts to go. You're anticipating. What's coming? Get a little tense. It's all the same thing. It's the same stimuli except for these Olympics. Adult athletes have learned to interpret the stimuli that the rest of us would say, as nervous as excited, they all said the same thing. No, I'm not nervous, I'm excited!And so I've actually practiced it, just tell myself when I start to get nervous that this is excitement now and somebody says, how do you feel I'm like really excited actually it came from just sort of telling myself, no no this is excitement and it becomes a little bit automatic later on and it's really kind of effect of it makes you want to rush for this rather than pull back. And yet it's the same.#excited #nervous #underpressure #metaoak # #work #personallife
