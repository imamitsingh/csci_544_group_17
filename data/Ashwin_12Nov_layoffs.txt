Core competencies are so important üî•

who doesn't really understand
what they bring to their day-to-day roles. üò≥ There are common core competencies
such as leadership, delegation,
time management organization,
critical thinking, creative thinking,

Core competencies give you an additional benefit which is‚Ä¶

Please don‚Äôt forget about the thousands of people impacted by layoffs who did not work at Meta, Twitter (insert other big tech name where people got unbelievable severances).

It is good to see employers who are investing in the last moments of someone‚Äôs career by helping them transition to a new career. When a large employer here in Omaha let 1000+ people go a few years ago, some of the employees got severance, but most all non-union employees got career counseling.  It was helpful, but 3-4 months to determine the next best step would be helpful to almost everyone.  Good data.. where does your company stand?

The job search. Where to begin? I am having this conversation a lot now. #maang as the go to companies no longer offers the express hire path. Where to look? Where to begin. Step 1 is NOT the resume update. That follows. The first step is plan and perspective. Where do you want to go. Your goals. Your desired impact. Your culture fit. Your assets‚Ä¶what do you bring to an organization. Second step is market survey. Who is growing. Who has people working on exciting problems. Where do you have a network to tap into. Did you know the ‚Äúeast apply‚Äù button is a tool created by the job posting websites to generate revenue? It is NOT to get you, the candidate betters odds to be invited to interview. There is an ‚Äúapplication fallacy‚Äù that is not well understood. Job posting sites want as many applications as possible. Then, you end up in a crowd with 100s or 1000s of applicants. Talk to humans. I recently reached to an organization to talk about a role I am researching. It took 7 people and a few messages to get 1 meeting. I will take that vs 300 easy applied and 5 interview invites. Oh‚Ä¶third step is networking. Fourth step in parallel with networking is to update the resume. Many job seekers skip steps or go out of sequence. The job search is much like the sales process. Step by step. This is what we do at Archer Career, take job seekers from here to there, guiding the path and navigating the steps and rock slides. #metalayoffs #layoffs #jobsearchadvice #jobsearchhelp #jobhunt #career #archercareer

üõë If you have been laid off and you are on a U.S. employment visa like the H-1B, first take a breath and know that you WILL get through this.Next, start taking proactive steps to plan for future U.S. visa stamping success. Don't panic or ignore the regulations. Even though it may be a while before your next U.S. visa interview, the time to prepare is now!Here‚Äôs what you need to know for your future visa stamp interview: - If you lose your job, your original employer will most likely notify USCIS of your employment being terminated. For the H-1B visa, once you cease to be employed, you have a maximum 60-day grace period to get another employer to sponsor you for H-1B employment, arrange to change to another status that allows you to stay in the U.S. (more on that below), or make plans to leave the United States. - At your next U.S. visa interview, your situation will be more complicated than your first application, and there is a higher risk for a visa denial or a 221(g) administrative processing outcome. You need to work proactively to prepare for that interview. - The Consular Officer will want to know the specifics of what happened when you lost your job, and what you did afterwards to comply with U.S. immigration law. Don‚Äôt be vague! - It is best to be proactive when sharing this information with the Visa Officer, and not appear to be withholding information, such as when you switched to another employer, how you changed status, and when you left the country. - If you choose to change status to a B visa to have more time in the United States, how you frame your situation and discuss what you did during that time at your next visa interview is crucial. For example, when you‚Äôre on an H-1B visa you can have ‚Äúdual intent‚Äù to stay in a temporary visa status even though steps have been taken towards obtaining U.S. permanent residence, but on a B visa, you can‚Äôt. So be prepared to give additional context and explain your situation in an honest, authentic, and concise way. By getting organized and having a plan, someday soon you will look back on this period as just a small blip in your career in the United States. #H1B #layoffs #visainterview #visaexperts #consularprocessing #USembassy #USconsulate

Hi connections,As a part of my curriculum at the UW Foster MSIS, I recently analyzed the various security and privacy concerns at Facebook over the years and presented them with some amicable solutions today. As I prepare myself to build tech products that affect the masses, understanding the network and data architecture is very important in order to design secure systems and mitigate risks. I would like to thank all my team members for their efforts - Gayatri, Asma, Pankhuri, Ghrinjs and Sabreena.This is a tough time for the tech industry with several firms announcing #layoffs. My deepest sympathies to all those affected by it. I strongly believe in the idea of community and this is a time for all of us to stand strong together. So if there‚Äôs anything that I could help you with, do not hesitate to reach out!

Helping others and being compassionate are part of human nature (I like to see it that way). LinkedIn Recruiter ùêÖùêàùêëùêíùêì filter is the ability to find people that are open to work. And I guarantee you, good recruiters will want to look for those people first - at least, they are my primary focus. It just makes sense. Either you want to put the green banner up or just add open to work where only recruiters can see, DO NOT ever THINK THAT THAT WILL MAKE YOU LOOK DESPERATE. I felt that before, but the moment I decided to add the green banner to my profile, I got my current job through networking within a couple of weeks or even less. Layoffs is a business decision, it‚Äôs not a personal failure. You‚Äôre more than that üíôüôèüèªüíô#layoffs #greenbannergang

‚ÄúMeta laid off 11,000 employees but is that the only cost-cutting measure possible?‚Äù‚Ä¢ Layoff is ‚Äúlosing livelihood‚Äù for 11,000 peopleThis is just one of the companies that is making it to the headlines but so many start ups, tech companies in India are doing that as well.I have done cost & process analysing for 3 years professionally and even as a third party hired to ‚Äúcut down cost‚Äù : our first resort would be reducing internal inefficiencies, perk up budget. Layoff would never be an option. When I actually research and deep dive further in general for companies :‚Ä¢ Can the free food to employees be not cut instead?‚Ä¢ Can the events and grandeur be cut down? ‚Ä¢ Can the perks like gym, ‚Äúsalon‚Äù, etc be not cut down for employees? ‚Ä¢ Can budgets be not reallocated? ‚Ä¢ if employers sign contracts for employees, can there be no way that there is protection given to employees for a couple of months mandatorily before layoffs ? ‚Ä¢ Profits are never split upto employees but losses are always somehow trickled down to them‚Ä¢ Should not every company be mandated to keep fund reserves atleast to support 6 months of employees even if the company makes losses?  It is exactly like how BSE / NSE asks for reserve fundsJob security has been a concern for so many with news. ‚Äúwhat if it is us next‚Äù And this results into so many unaddressed issues like anxiety, trauma and more. And this also makes me realise the importance of ‚Äúsavings‚Äù an old age word which is trickled down by parents but GenZ is not used to it. We believe in ‚Äúliving in the moment‚ÄùHaving an emergency üÜò fund is important. How are you feeling about this?#usa #metalayoffs #metalayoff #layoff #cost #tech #layoffs #finance

Along with the many other layoffs we've been hearing about recently, I'm disappointed to share that my company has also eliminated me. Even though my time at Underknown was cut short, I'm proud of the content we've been able to create on our show, Around the World, and the impact I've had since I started. (Over 45 million views on Facebook alone dating back to May)With that being said, I have a lot to offer in my next role. My experience spans across production management, video editing and content creation, project management, podcast hosting/production, and on-air broadcasting. I've worked in a variety of sectors such as entertainment, sports, and business/entrepreneurship.If you know of anyone who is hiring or needs assistance on any projects, please keep me in mind. I'm open to any and all connections and really appreciate your consideration. #layoffs #jobsearch #opentowork

For everyone, take note of how an employer treats folks on the way out. Just as important, if not more, as the way they treat people on the way in. Note, who remembers it‚Äôs people not just employees at the end of the day, treats them with dignity, and empathizes with resources, severance, and more. For those who haven‚Äôt experienced layoff before, remember, this can be you one day and as employees, we should all be mindful of this. #peoplefirst #layoffs

"Consultations""Headcount optimization""Rightsizing""Job reductions"What other unhelpful, sugarcoated and indirect ways have you come across for saying "layoffs"?Genuine question: Does the term really matter if the action is the same? People are losing jobs. They are losing livelihoods...this means not just a paycheck but a sense of identity, steady source of income, meaning and relationships. Already minoritised and marginalized communities will be most impacted. Even in companies taking a "racial equity lens" during layoffs aren't getting it right...facing resentment from survivors and laid off employees alike.What are the best, or at least, the least harmful things you've seen organizations do when they're considering #layoffs?

Potentially unpopular opinion incoming.. But I've wanted to post about this topic for a while, so here it goes.Every time I see a post on here from someone who hasn't been active in months/years, and they're asking for help finding a job after a spontaneous layoff.. Only one thought comes to mind."Where were you when things were going well?" üôÉYes, it's a shame that spontaneous layoffs have hit so many people. Nobody deserves to lose their job so abruptly, especially so unceremoniously. But it makes no sense to me when people expect their network -- a network with whom they've never engaged and have no real connection with -- to help them find new work üòêùôèùôùùôö ùôóùôöùô®ùô© ùô©ùôûùô¢ùôö ùô©ùô§ ùôóùô™ùôûùô°ùôô ùôßùôöùô°ùôñùô©ùôûùô§ùô£ùô®ùôùùôûùô•ùô® ùôûùô® ùô¨ùôùùôöùô£ ùô©ùôùùôûùô£ùôúùô® ùôñùôßùôö ùôúùô§ùôûùô£ùôú ùô¨ùôöùô°ùô°. ùôÑùô©'ùô® ùôñùô°ùô° ùôñùôóùô§ùô™ùô© ùôúùôûùô´ùôö ùôñùô£ùôô ùô©ùôñùô†ùôö.You give to your network when you can.

I'm looking for a TA Leadership role. How can you help? A referral, making an introduction, providing a LinkedIn recommendation, commenting words of encouragement. I would appreciate any and all support right now.This week has been hard. I even wrote a post about it on Thursday. After pouring my heart out to help support so many on how to move forward after being laid off, yesterday I got a firsthand seat on a zoom to hear the same news for myself. I was so surprised! (now I understand the depths of everyones feelings in that moment- why me? how do I tell my family..especially my kids? etc.) After the call, I was numb to my thoughts and feelings most of the day because as a leader, (which btw- I've always said you dont need a title to be a leader!) my people came first. I immediately turned to help those affected yesterday. I spent most of my day having conversations with others who were also impacted, offering support and words of encouragement. I also had a lot of conversations with those that were not affected (Thank you to all of those that reached out to me! I appreciate you!) but, the important part was to also send them words of encouragement. They may not be working alongside me, but now I'm only one call, text, or LI message away! The folks that I've worked with, and alongside of,  for the past 1.5 years are some of the most talented and wonderful people that I know. I only want the best for each person as they continue their professional journey. (I told y'all I love BIG!) Yesterday I changed my banner to "Open to Work" (Thank you to all who noticed and made introductions.) Today, I'm putting my status out there for everyone to see that I'm looking for a new TA Leader role. If you are looking for a TA leader who can build and lead great teams, a leader who encompasses company values, one who becomes your brand ambassador and believes in your mission and your people, one who understands senior leadership and the importance of moving the company forward in growth and profitability- with a true leadership mindset, one who works as a team and collaborates wholeheartedly in a way that is mission driven to the organizational goals, one who pivots on a dime and jumps in throughout the organization based upon the need for company success (L&D, employee engagement, etc) without direction, one who truly understands that when you take care of your people...they will help take care of the business. There is so much more to me than this post, my profile, and even my resume. All these things are just words and I believe my actions and the results speak so much louder. I'm excited to see what happens next on my journey, as I have so much to offer any great organization. Always remember...Kindness, Changes Everything! #opentowork #leadership #talentacquisition #layoffs

The true empathetic way of laying off employees on visa is by giving them extra days on payroll equivalent to the period for which you wanted to give them severance pay.If you're a CEO or C-level executive who is planning on laying off employees in US, I'm sure you want to do it as empathetically as possible and it's not an easy decision for you. The best way to show empathy to employees on visa in US is to give them time on payroll equivalent to the time you planned to give them severance pay. This will give them extra time to find a job in addition to the 60 days given by USCIS at the end of which, they need to pack their lives and leave US.Btw this is my personal opinion.#visa #h1bvisa #layoffs

I think we should all be critical of companies who claim to be committed to prioritizing #diversity #equity and #inclusion but are laying off huge swaths of the professionals they employ to do that work on their behalf internally and externally (ERGs, HR, recruiting etc.). #Tech in particular we know has a diversity problem and I‚Äôve see a number of folks who‚Äôve dedicated their careers to fixing this problem  be part of the recent #layoffs and it is disheartening and a little frightening for what that could mean for representation in the industry.

Are You Being Quiet Fired? | As companies face tightening budgets, many may be considering trimming their workforce. But of course, outright layoffs are expensive and risky. That‚Äôs why some have turned to a subtler strategy: quiet firing, or intentionally creating a hostile work environment that encourages people to leave ‚Äúvoluntarily.‚Äù The authors‚Äô new research sheds light on how employees can tell if they‚Äôre being quietly fired, including changes to work responsibilities, compensation, and communication, and offers ten tactical steps workers can take before throwing in the towel. #QuietFired #Layoffs #HostileWorkEnvironment #CompanyCulture #Belonging

#meta employees get a 16 week severance package along with other benefits from their layoff. #randstad  gave us an additional 1 week of pay and our remainder PTO days (which we were only given 8 days in a year). I‚Äôm not saying a layoff is easy for anyone, but it is much easier for some than some others right now. Please consider reaching out to not just people posting about their layoffs from large organizations, but anyone looking for a job, and respond to people who are reaching out to you. Not all of us get the same benefits as others during these times. #awareness #layoffs #jobsearch #hiringmanagers #recruiters #newjobs

Friedrich Moritz August Retzsch‚Äôs painting, known as ‚ÄúCheck mate‚Äù hung in the Louvre until recently.It depicts a forlorn man losing a chess game to a haughty devil as an angel looks on.The story goes that a chess master was visiting the Louvre and upon observing the painting, noticed something strange‚Ä¶The man hadn‚Äôt lost.In fact, he could still win.His King had one more move. To quote Walter D Wintle:‚Äú If you think you‚Äôre beaten you are. If you think you dare not, you don‚Äôt. If you‚Äôd like to win, but think you can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs almost certain you won‚Äôt‚Ä¶. Life‚Äôs battles don‚Äôt always go to the stronger or faster man. But soon or late, the man who wins, is the one who thinks he can.‚ÄùA lot of our problems relate to our attitudes and how we wish to perceive things. Being open and willing to see the moves that you can still make, could be the difference between personal victory and defeat.Wishing those out there who have been affected by the latest #layoffs the strength to see the moves that they can still make, even if you feel defeated.‚úåÔ∏è

To the Facebook/Meta peeps who got laid off; I am very sorry, and my heart goes out to you. I have a very good working knowledge of what you‚Äôre probably feeling, right now. I found myself in a similar boat, only a few months ahead of you. The first week was harder than I‚Äôd ever anticipated. Hurt in ways I never saw coming. Felt like there was a battle going on in, and for, my soul. Turns out, there actually was. I would love to chat with anyone of you who would like to talk. I can tell you more about the hope I have, and the way it has worked out for my good, and far beyond what I could have ever asked or imagined.  #facebook #meta #layoffs

A story of #layoffs and #foreignworkers with a #happyending -- please read! #youhaveoptions A number of years ago, a former client reached out to me following a layoff from a #fortune500 company. He had been a C-level  employee, earning a serious salary, with corresponding obligations in the U.S.  It should go without saying that the #layoff knocked the wind out of his sails.  But he didn't have time to wallow; this was before the #60daygraceperiod was put in place, and so we had to find a solution for him urgently. He had had an idea for a #startup percolating in the back of his mind for some time, and the layoff forced his hand. He decided to launch!  Because he was from a treaty country, we were able to change his status to #E2visa, based on his investment in his own startup company. He and his family were able to remain in the U.S. during the #changeofstatus so that his children's schooling was not interrupted.  His wife was able to obtain #workauthorization as his dependent, which she had lost with his layoff. Had he not been from a treaty country, we also had an excellent case for an #O1Avisa. Ultimately, the layoff led to a #careerpivot that set him on a better path. I am protecting anonymity, but suffice to say that today he is ultimately much #happier and more #successful!#SanFranciscoLawGroup is here to support people who have been laid off. Please feel free to use my network -- I am happy to make introductions! If you are a foreign national, let's talk about your visa options!

I've worked for Meta for almost 6 years. This morning I woke up in a panic to some of the worst news I've ever received. I was part of the #metalayoffs. I'm still processing what this means. Unfortunately my husband was also part of layoffs last year for his company, and so we're both currently unemployed. This leaves us to make some really tough decisions. And in desperate need of work. As part of my #30daysofgratitude challenge this month, I want to share my gratitude for everyone who greatly impacted my life at Meta. I was pushed beyond my comfort zone and asked to grow in ways I never thought I could. My time there was absolutely invaluable.  And there are so many of you who contributed to that. Stephanie Carroll Angela Gonzalez Frederick Chandra John Marullo who were the best teammates I could have asked for, and truly cared about me as a person. And I know we will be friends for many years to come!So what's next?Well, I'm open to new opportunities! Now more than ever I ask my network to support me by sharing my profile and keeping an ear out for opportunities that would fit my experience. Please share my profile and resume as much as you can. And share any job postings you come across that would be a good fit! My experience includes: events, project management, people manager, recruiting operations, people operations, program management. #meta #facebook #layoffs #opentowork

If you‚Äôve been laid off while on a visa, I know how scary the 60 day grace period can be. Here are three concrete things you can do if you are on a visa and have recently been laid off:üí° Extend your 60-day grace period to a total of eight months by filing a change of status from H-1B to another category, such as a visitor, student, or dependent spouse. You can use our free visa picker to see what visa might be right for you.https://https://lnkd.in/gVvPZ5BSüí° Create your own venture! This is an amazing time to start a new venture.

I Was A Full-Time Employee @ Meta for 3 Days...For the past 3 years, I have worked at Meta Platforms mainly in iOS Mobile Development as a Software Engineering Intern - taking on and completing projects that Full-Time Software Engineers face in an average 12-week sprint. I loved working at Meta, and I have grown so much as a programmer & teammate through my past experiences. I was ecstatic to accept a Full-Time Software Engineering Role to work at the company and started on November 7th.I felt so prepared to contribute and collaborate in just this first week, but unfortunately, I was part of the employees impacted by the #MetaLayoff.  Fortunately, this means I am back on the job market and I am looking for a new role as soon as possible! I'm excited to take the skills I have built at Meta into another position.As I start this journey, I would be so grateful for any and all advice support, and referrals in this next chapter. Thank you in advance for all the love and assistance you provide in this challenging time.As I part ways with Meta, I want to thank all of the teams I have served on in the past. From Instagram Design Systems to Facebook Public Groups,  I have learned and grown so much in the presence of such skilled and ambitious colleagues. Additionally, to my first experiences on the Menlo Park Campus as a part of FBU, I'm so thankful for all of the forever friendships that were formed back in 2019. To others no longer at #Meta that find themselves impacted by this news similarly, let us all have faith. Even through these trying times, there is something great JUST FOR US at the end of this testimony. Everything happens for a reason, and I look forward to the day when I think of this time and smile.  #openforwork #opportunity #techcareers #recruiting #layoffs #layoffs #harvarduniversity #softwareengineer #blackintech #grateful

Which is the right meditation for me ? People surf through meditation channels on Youtube as if they are selecting from a grocery list, then they keep jumping from video to video, and don‚Äôt know which one to settle with.¬†Meditation brings calmness with awareness in your system. We want the most out of one meditation, but meditation is slow and steady progress. The mind loves time-travel, worrying about what will happen in the future or dwelling on regrets and blame from the past, meditation anchors it to the present.Allowing the mind to stay in the present, by accepting the mistakes of the past, and relaxing with the anxieties of the future makes the mind become gentle with the thoughts, that enter and exit.I follow Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Ji‚Äôs meditation as each meditation is so deep and Gurudev gives enough time to settle, there are fine nuances taken care of, and I love Gurudev's voice to dive deeper. There are hundreds of them on Youtube. Find any, play it, close your eyes, sit in a comfortable position and you are on. I usually shuffle them, as otherwise my mind knows the meditation-lyrics and start's guessing what‚Äôs coming next in the audio. Begin with any.Stay Strong. Indulge.¬†#meditation #stress #happiness #future #layoffs #

Also, share the second link with people hiring in your network. ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüí° Layoffs are tough, but sometimes they are needed for the organization's survival. The case of Twitter could be handled in a better way. What strategy would you recommend if Elon had to lay off 50%+ people? Let me know in the comments below. üëá#layoffs #twitter #twitterlayoffs #roofstock #sanfrancisco #jobsearch #jobs
-----------------------------
Sometimes, #layoffs are absolutely necessary for the survival of a company.However, most times they‚Äôre done by companies with plenty of cash in the bank, just to reach some arbitrary number ‚ÄúThe Street‚Äù wants. I‚Äôm proud to work for a company that plans for the long term and places so much importance on its employees.11,000 people are losing their jobs at #meta today. More than 3,000 at #twitter just last week. As much as I disagree with those companies, their products, customer experience and how terrible they are for our society, I can‚Äôt help but feel bad for those employees affected and their families. Those two are not mutually exclusive.Just in the last couple days I had a a few recruiters reach out with some cool marketing positions (but as you can tell I‚Äôm not going anywhere). If you‚Äôre a marketing leader looking for a new gig, reach out on DM and I‚Äôll be happy to pass along your name to these recruiters.
-----------------------------
Such a fantastic way to help. If anyone is looking for their next role, and needs a place to start, look no further.

HBR keeps serving me timely and relevant articles (I‚Äôve got lots more to share!) but this one really hits home for a variety of reasons.I was laid off in late August from a job I really enjoyed. Like most people recently laid off, I was fully invested in the role and the company, envisioned a long career and didn‚Äôt (and still don‚Äôt) have a fully updated resume, LinkedIn profile, and my networking skills (never great to begin with) are quite rusty. I took the ‚Äútake some time to process‚Äù to an extreme and only now a couple of months later am I really starting to jump into ‚Äòthe search‚Äô and get myself back on track.If you or anyone in your network are looking to connect with someone who has a diverse range of skills and experiences honed over a 20+ year career that includes B2B SaaS startup experience (with a successful exit), an obsession with growing revenue through customer service via ‚Äòvalue enhancement‚Äô tactics, a stint in the cannabis industry, a leadership style that values employee engagement and growth, cross-functional consensus building, and a relentless focus on ‚ÄòThe Team‚Ä¶ The Team‚Ä¶ The Team‚Äô, let‚Äôs talk.And for anyone reading this that is in a similar situation and wants to just chat/vent/share recipes (I make a great French Toast; spoiler alert: orange zest is the secret ingredient); whatever you want to talk about, feel free to reach out to me for some straight up networking.

Terrible week and it‚Äôs so hard to find words. While I was not impacted by the RIF at Meta/Facebook, it‚Äôs heartbreaking to see so many talented colleagues and team-members either leave the company or enter a multi-week consultation process to find out definitively if their role is impacted. These people are the best of the best in their jobs and it has been a privilege knowing them and working with them. Design is a small world and if you‚Äôre a hiring manager out there, this is a rare opportunity to add world-class talent to your team. Check out the resources below.If you‚Äôre an impacted designer or UX professional (at Meta or any other company given how bad these past few weeks have been) and need a friendly ear to discuss options, review your portfolio, or just talk, I‚Äôm a DM away.

Recently, layoffs have made things worst in times of recession and a falling economy.With the big layoffs that happened last week, I visualized the layoffs data for the past three years (2020-2022) from layoffs.fyi on tableau for better insights.Please have a look at my Tableau Story:https://lnkd.in/gA_P7sgsMy findings from the analysis of data on Tableau are:‚≠ï From 2020 to 2022, the year 2021 had the least layoffs.‚≠ï Because of Covid, the first Quarter of 2020 had the most layoffs, while the rest year was stable.‚≠ï Unfortunately, the year 2022 has the significant layoffs since the start.¬†‚≠ï Month of November with the highest number of layoffs in 2022 (Because of Meta layoffs).‚≠ï The top three countries facing the most layoffs are the United States, India, and Brazil.‚≠ï Consumer, Transportation, and Real State industries are most affected, while Legal, Product, and Aerospace industries are least affected by layoffs in the USA.‚≠ï Meta, Uber, and Peloton have had the highest number of laid-off employees in the past three years. Also, worksheet 6 shows no significant layoff trend for the past years.‚≠ï San Francisco Bay area, New York City, and Boston have the highest layoffs.‚≠ï Companies in IPO Stage have the most layoffs in all three years.‚≠ï This is surprising, but Total layoffs and funds raised are directly proportional. Increases in fundraising have also caused layoffs.‚≠ï In the Bay area, fundraising has caused fewer layoffs than before. Similarly, a decrease in fundraising has caused more layoffs.I hope it gives a better understanding of layoffs.
