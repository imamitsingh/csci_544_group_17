⭐️ Consistency is vital!🔋 In times you enjoy, remember it, as you’ll need that feeling to kick you off (motivate) when it becomes difficult.  📈 When things start being hard, know that you are on the right path. Pain is feedback from your mind and body that you are breaking the limits - You are growing.#motivation #growthmindset

Growth can be uncomfortable sometimes, but once you start seeing the results of your efforts and the improvement, it becomes addicting. You start falling in love with whom you are becoming and the places you are going.What lies ahead becomes more exciting, you start to have a sense of purpose, and it motivates you to work harder and pray even more. 2022 is almost over, and I can not help but remain thankful for the growth I have experienced this year. I am looking forward to more, and even though I know that hard work might not be enough, I also know that his Grace is sufficient. #growthmindset #thankful

I’m continuing to set an intention to “Be Fearless” as I close out 2022. Amazon taught me the importance of getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and the importance of taking risks. I am proud to say I am doing just that, even if it is pretty scary. I will be adding environmental law to my health & safety practice, 12 years into my career. With this next step, I am pursuing an interest I’ve had since law school. While I’m stepping into the unknown, I’m excited to continue learning and being fearless at any age. #befearless #takerisks #growthmindset

Unleashing my old rebellious side which has been transformed…..I have always been a rebel at heart.  But before I really harnessed it, it would come out more in contrarian or adversarial ways.  It wasn’t pretty and could be even repelling at times. Then I spent a number of years in my professional groups, feeling like I had to keep it very contained and buttoned up.  I was suppressing parts of me. I felt like there was no space for them to come to life.I’ve spent the last 3 years tapping into all aspects of my psyche and my personality, accessing parts that I love and don’t love so muchI’ve been gentle, loving, and nurturing to the parts that I don’t love so that I could learn to understand them more and make the necessary shifts in me and my parts, so that we all can live in harmony togetherSo here I am, two weeks away from turning 49 and I decided it was time that I allow her to be seen again.This time in a new light, with a new vibe, and a whole set of different intentions!📷 My new nose piercing symbolizes this and so much more for me.

For my fellow Business Psychologists and HR professionals.I recently had the privilege of attending the Association of Business Psychologists (ABP) conference on behalf of LSEG. Here are my top 3 takeways: 1. Growth mindset and cognitive diversity – not new concepts, but did you know that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella increased market cap from $300bn in 2014 to $1.8 trillion in 2022? A big part of the success was attributed to creating a learning culture – transforming colleagues from ‘know it alls’ to ‘learn it alls’. Not being the smartest person in the room meant that employees were more open to reviewing mistakes and accepting the failures that can come with innovation. Thanks to Matthew Syed Consulting for that great nugget. 2. Acquiring neurodiversity – with 15-20% of the population considered to be neurodiverse, better understanding the potential benefits and challenges has been a passion of mine over the last year or two. Through this I have more commonly heard about Autism, ADHD, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia and many other conditions that are a result of brain development when people are born or a young child, even if diagnosis comes in adulthood. Uzma Waseem at Genius Within presented a helpful 4 quadrant model (see picture below) which includes ‘acquired neurodiversity’ which occurs later in life and can be temporary or permanent. Research is in early stages but starting to make connections between the effects of covid or ‘brain fog’ in menopause as forms of neurodiversity. 3. Graduate recruitment often includes as many stages as executives – Martin Kavanagh from Amberjack presented some helpful research covering 300,000 candidates from a range of industries. With attraction, candidate experience and time from application to offer at the forefront of employers minds, organisations will need to balance the robustness of their hiring process with ensuring they are not missing out on talent. For anyone else also at the conference – did these insights resonate with you? What else would you add?#abp #neurodiversityatwork #growthmindset #earlycareers

Hot take: I have never understood why those who have not walked the walk are invited to give talks on #leadership. I prefer to learn from someone’s lived experience & someone who has been “in the arena.” https://lnkd.in/e_TH2B22 “The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause…”#Scholarship & academia have their place, but those safely within the ivory tower, writing books or doing podcasts cannot know what it means to be “mentally tough” in actual leadership with #accountabilty for budgets, jobs, lives. I want to learn from someone who knows what #moralinjury feels like or needing to sleep at night while holding power over others’ jobs, salaries, health benefits.While negative self talk does need to be eradicated for #success, as it runs down your energy & is not consistent with #growthmindset, in fact the people whose jobs are about life & death like surgeons or Navy SEALs are not about self validation. You do need to be honest with yourself on gaps & learning needs. You need to be comfortable with discomfort, not just self soothe. Some jobs do demand perfection & do require exceptional results. That happens when a prior error motivates you never repeat it again. This is a unpopular opinion but I find those like Brene Brown offer platitudes, not effective, realistic, or outcomes-oriented suggestions from having achieved success in a real life leadership position of having to make tough choices or have personal accountabilty/liability for her actions. I also find she is out of touch with women of color’s experiences in leadership & her advice fails in context of “the glass cliff.” https://lnkd.in/gyruKZ_K If you look at how Dr. Susan Moore was described, when she was a patient, dying of COVID - what could be more “vulnerable” than that? - as “intimidating”, then we must be honest that tropes against Black women means “vulnerability” simply does not apply. https://lnkd.in/eEX4vXBq Dr. Moore was not attempting to “play victim.” She was actually dying. Her literal vulnerability, and using her voice to receive care and pain medications, was mislabeled “intimidating.” That reminds me of “Ain’t I a woman?” https://lnkd.in/e_TH2B22 Centuries of treating some women & men as subhuman “brute” labor means many people’s brains cannot see “vulnerability” in those they do not see as fully human. Skin color blocks empathy in some. https://lnkd.in/e-8wdyiJSame can be true towards immigrants & immigrant women.These are double standards. Brene Brown’s experience of American society or of corporate culture simply is different from a lot of us.

I paid my son to do some work for me this weekend. 💰 At one point I said “you are making more than me now.” 😢 It actually felt depressing for a minute but I did a quick reality check. 👀The truth is, most of us entrepreneurs do what we do for the love of creating. 🎨There comes a point in the journey when many of us consider selling, but not because we want to retire (maybe you do?). 🧾 It’s because we have something else we can’t wait to create!💎If you are a founder or creator, don’t value your time in dollars. 🚫What’s the big picture of your brand value and how will that benefit you, your family and everyone involved in the supply chain over the next decade? 🌎Now THAT is an abundant mindset. 💰💰💰 #entrepreneurs #work #familybusiness #growthmindset #brandbuilding #finance #mompreneur

This is a personal post so feel free to scroll past if not interested in #blackhair.This week is my locaversary! I have always loved hair care and leveraged my hair as my favorite accessory. My hair was relaxed for most of my life and I big chopped in 2015 while working in corporate. I embraced the look even though my colleagues shared unsolicited commentary about my tresses. It also wasn’t lost on me I was one of a handful of Black women in the office. When I transitioned into sales, I decided to start showing up as my whole self from head to toe. I felt powerful and gorgeous. My Sisterlocks are another expression of my creativity but not every woman is able to lean in. Black women’s appearances are heavily policed and our natural hair isn’t seen as “professional.”I pray that every woman in every industry will be able to express themselves without backlash or side eye. Oh, and can we get The CROWN Act passed as federal law?Thanks. #debtdownassetsup #generationalwealthbuilding #personaldevelopment #growthmindset #powerofpositivity #womenintech #blackintech

Welcome to the stage that every entrepreneur dreams of: Growth 🦄 (This post is a little bit long, but worth it 👀 )If you think that growth happens through direct Selling only, You’re Mistaken! It is by no means a one-man job nor a one-team job. It is a joint effort of talented teams operating in the right culture. At the Growth stage, you’re expanding your team and customer-centricity shall now be at the heart of your team’s DNA, with a pinch of #Sales. Besides having a product-market fit, here’s what you’ll need to look at 👇 1️⃣  Growth/Commercial TeamThe team that understands your product and client pains equally, and monetizes the product through proper value based pricing and bundles that fit your clients’ needs. 2️⃣ Branding & Communications TeamThe team that builds a brand that resonates with your audiences and gives it a unique position in the market, setting it for organic growth. That is only achievable by building a brand that screams purpose through the right brand character and voice. Clients don't only buy from you for the product, they also buy for what your brand stands for. 3️⃣ Marketing TeamThe team that  works closely with Product & Sales teams to better understand the ins and outs of the product and then establish your reach and create demand around your product. The team will engage audiences, generate leads to the top of the funnel, and nurture them [while watching your unit economics closely. Ex: a healthy Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)].4️⃣ Sales TeamThose are the first troop of frontliners, and I have to say, they must be $$ oriented and hungry for success.These team members have to be consultants for your clients, establish trust, and show expertise. They will engage to sell value solutions, not push to close a deal for the sake of hitting the sales target. Dry, transactional relationships won’t take things far and the brand will be perceived as careless (boo!).5️⃣ After-Sales TeamPoor on-boarding and utilization of solutions will ultimately lead to throwing away the hard work of all prior functions. That is exactly why the second troop of front-liners, After-Sales, should understand that churn is their #1 enemy and customer satisfaction is their best friend.This team is the key to a rich chain of solid word-of-mouth, referrals, and brand evangelist leading to organic growth (one of your #growth #flywheel elements). And no, I did not forget about other support functions that as well need to be customer centric, such as Finance/Billing and their impact on the customer experience.RECAP: Growth only happens when customer centricity goes along your customer journey, not only at the early stages of your startup. Maintaining that is usually a challenge that you need to embrace. Clear goals and team alignment are crucial to setting a business for success. Stick around 🙂 #business #entrepreneur #success #growthmindset

Recently I was honored with a Growth Mindset Award. What does that mean? Growth Mindset is an attitude that we cultivate our capacities through experimentation (and failure). My chance was helping SFS improve and integrate a software tool into our rapidly evolving business. Rather than recap the tech, tinkering, teaching, etc, here’s my recipe for personal or organizational change: 1. Secure safe operating space (and time) to get creative and recover from setbacks.2. Carefully check your landscape and tools. Create a basic but informed plan (with plan Bs).  3. Acknowledge what you can’t control. Dig around the big rocks, looking for leverage points.    4. Take full advantage of what you can control, however small. What you focus on grows.     5. Start with small, practical projects that accomplish something tangible at their own scale. 6. Connect small successes into a larger design. Let working parts shape overall design. 7. Help willing helpers co-create the change. Group momentum will bring along the laggards.  8. Tell a simple, relevant story. The story may change slightly, but must stay recognizable.   9. Call out the conditions that created your challenge and big rocks you worked around. Can they be rolled away yet?#growthmindset #changeagent #changemanagement #emergence #emergentstrategy #sustainability #leadthechange #siemens

I always recommend to people that are interested to get trained.Curious Spectator: Why do you do it?Me: Many reasons...I fly because it's fun! I fly because it helps catapult my mental readiness which gived me the ability to create a balanced psychological state to perform at an optimal level. Curious Spectator: Wow! Do you ever get scared up there?Me: Sometimes... I can only control what I can control. I they to set myself up for success every time I fly. Meaning, I can't control things like the wind, however I can choose to fly that day or stay ground. I make those types of decisions by analyzing the weather conditions for various altitudes. I can't control other planes that enter the air space but I can be cognizant of them. These decisions seep into other areas of our lives... we can't control everything. but we can make the best decision in those environments to set ourselves up for success.

I feel inspired to share with you some of last week's experiences that were complete opposites but evoked the same feelings in me.Maybe I'm a bit strange; you can be the judge of it...When I think of my experience that happened at the beginning of the week, I think of positive feedback a client shared with me, well, praised me. This experience had me thinking about the frequency we receive it and the effect it has on us and our performance. Although it happens less than we'd like it to happen, once it comes, it gives us wings and a spring in our step. Positive feedback reinforces my working habits and proves that the steps and decisions I'm making are producing visible results. These results  help and enable my clients to communicate with their audience in their native language, allowing them to send a clear and focused message.Positive feedback gives me the opportunity to invest more time and energy into my job and gives me confidence that I can adapt and learn quickly and efficiently. That's why this positive feedback made the beginning of my week exciting and incredible!The end of the week got me sweating and scrambling for improvised and quick solutions. It brought a very kind, fair, but clearly negative feedback from a client. I have to admit that the client was as patient and understanding as humanly possible, and the negative feedback was neutral and subtle. But it was negative, and me being me, got working extra hard to find solutions and solve the negative results my decisions have produced. Negative feedback made me reinforce my working habits again, it humbled me into realization that there's so much more to learn and motivated me to invest more time and energy into my job. Heeding such constructive negative feedback helps you adapt and learn quickly and efficiently.Negative feedback made the end of my week exciting and nerve-racking.What it all comes down to, is taking both positive and negative feedback and turning it into a force that allows you to grow and gives you the strength to become better than yesterday.As I said before, my opposite experiences got me feeling the same kind of feelings. Probably not so strange after all, I guess.What are your experiences? #positivefeedback #growthmindset #contemplating

You can't code! ...is what I kept telling myself forever.  Now, I'm humbled and excited because I've proven myself wrong. I'm feeling super accomplished! A bit over a month ago, I knew little to nothing about git versioning, html, css, developing in general.  Now, I have just built a repo from scratch, did some basic html & css, and the full git commands, all through command line. Yes, those are super basic, and I am not going to become a developer. My main goal is to be more a more technically capable professional and product manager. 1 month ago I had 0 clue how to do any of that, and now I do. It feels great! #html #css #Progress #Developer #programming #product #productmanager #developers #growthmindset

Great sellers must be the unsung hero, willing to do whatever must be done to properly prioritize the customer, their company and the outcome - time and time again - often taking all the flak. Sales VP and author Jeff Kirchick joins Microsoft's #1 social seller & Salesman on Fire author Carson V. Heady to discuss.Check out the full conversation here: https://lnkd.in/gBu9fSsW We often have to embrace fear, uncertainty and discomfort to be the instrument that drives the right result.However, we cannot put together meaningful relationships and deals without all of the right stakeholders. Challenging conversations will happen. Effectively articulate your desire to help them win.From boldly reaching out to executives to staying the course in tough negotiations, the selling game has a lot of ups and downs - great sales requires resilience, perseverance and commitment."Run headfirst into the adversity." Some of our best relationships have had plenty of anguish. Be respectful, build trust, be transparent and be humble and you've controlled all you can.Check out the full conversation here: https://lnkd.in/gBu9fSsW #leadership #success #coaching #management #motivation #sales #career #salespeople #salescareer #sellingskills #sellingtips #growthmindset #lifelonglearner

What are the top 3 tips from the worlds top performance psychologist….I stumbled across Eric G. Potterat, Ph.D.  watching a documentary about neuroscience. He was talking about how he designed processes to support Navy Seal recruits going through the toughest challenges in training which simulates near drowning situations. Process seems key to building resilience in times of challenge - goal setting, mental rehearsal, self talk and arousal control.Whilst of course I’ve never been in high intensity situations like Seal training, I can vaguely relate to some of the mental challenges he’s talking about in some of these drills from being smashed about in class 5 rapids when I spent 3 months kayaking on the river Nile in Uganda. Through repetition and training I learned whilst trapped in retentive hydraulic river features to keep calm, conserve air and trust the ability of my “Eskimo roll” once out of it. Would love to hear what you’ve learned recently about improving performance  #neuroscience #growthmindset #performanceimprovement

What's your own 'black tea insight'?
-----------------------------
After the Black Ferns won the Rugby World Cup on Saturday night, I immediately downloaded Ruby Tui's book to my kindle.  I then stayed up far too late reading and when finishing it on Sunday afternoon, I quickly drove down to the bookstore to get a physical copy as there were just too many parts I wanted to highlight.The first half of this book is the story of her childhood which was tough to say the least.  It speaks to your heart and you feel for the kid she was and what she went through.The second half of the book is a masterclass around leadership, both personally and within a team and the importance of team culture."But to me, the greatest player stands up when there are no cameras and when they can hide behind comfort but they choose not to … when everything seems to be going great but they still choose to make the room uncomfortable and say what needs to be said. They make the players next to them not only feel safe to express themselves, but able to trust them in the most incredible pressure-filled moments. When they are struggling, they come to you and they don’t feel like they have to suffer alone. When we win on the field, we celebrate together. When we lose, we hold our heads up because we did everything we could and we had every conversation we needed to. To me, true greatness is felt in a team and it is in a look in the eye and in the hug you know is always there for you, day or night. " (from "Straight Up" by Ruby Tui)That quote there sums up growth mindset leadership and psychological safety.  It's just one of the many gems in this book and I was already a total Ruby Tui fangirl before reading this, and after this, I am just so grateful that we have such an incredible role model and person here in Aotearoa New Zealand.  I highly recommend this book for any leader.  I am always fascinated with the stories of top performers, whether in sports or business and this is one of the best I've read.#growthmindset #psychologicalsafety #blackferns #bookrecommendation #leadership #culture

My absolute favorite thing as a leader is watching people succeed, growing and developing into the leaders I knew they could be, and watching them in turn create leaders. I cannot tell you how happy it makes me when I get to promote people, or when I get phone calls from past team members telling me they've been promoted! That is how I measure my success! #Leadership #GrowthMindset #ServingOthers

What's your superpower?As I’ve been pondering my next career move, I feel unsure of what direction to go. It’s a problem I’ve always had because I have a variety of interests and a broad skillset, and I’m exactly 50-50 right brain-left brain. That combination offers so many options! In the last couple of weeks, I’ve created spreadsheets highlighting my experiences, skills, interests, and self-proclaimed strengths. I’ve made lists detailing specific accomplishments. I’ve researched specific job titles and job descriptions that align with some or most of the items on my lists. I’m still not sure what direction to head. A few days ago, I had a lovely brunch with a friend (who also happens to be a career coach) and she suggested I try this assignment. I will be asking friends, family, and co-workers (present and former) what they think my superpower is. I think I know what I’m good at, but after asking just one person, I see the value in this exercise. I met another friend for coffee yesterday and when I posed this question to her, she responded without hesitation. She said the word that immediately came to mind was engagement. "You present ideas in a variety of ways to engage others. Others want to learn from you, and you create an environment where it is comfortable to ask questions. You create a safe space where it is ok to make mistakes and you promote a growth mindset. You lead by example. You show people what you want them to do.” I was surprised because it was such a great answer and not something I would have thought about myself. I was also surprised because she didn’t even need to think about it. She pointed out that’s just who I am, and I live it every day. What have I learned from this exercise after asking just one person? I’ve learned that others see my strengths better than I do. I’ve also learned that as I focus on my next career move, I need to think about what kind of roles will let me be unapologetically me and live my strengths. I encourage you to find out what others see as your superpowers. How will you use those superpowers to make the world a better place? I will keep you posted on what else I find out about myself!#superpowers #growthmindset #selfreflection

But no one has ever guided him on what not to say in an interview. 😬He really wanted this job, but based on our conversations, he didn't seem to be a good fit. 😵But that doesn't mean I can't help to guide him to his next successful interview. ✔He reached out for the status of his application; the result wasn't what he wanted.

If you’re trying to level up, don’t sleep on feedback loops.In your rush and excitement to start something new — whether it’s a personal goal, system/process, or new habit — be wary of thinking your job is done. Too often people overindex on perfection out of the gate. This delays your start, puts you at risk of never launching, or locking things in, never to be changed again.Instead, build rapid feedback into your plan.SurveysData pointsMetrics & KPIsSentimentThis concept of practicing in public may seem intimidating, but it’s the fastest way to grow. Everything you try you are testing and recieving an immediate response.

Growth is uncomfortable because it involves change. Going somewhere you’ve never been before. Doing things that may challenge you. Things that may be messy where you may fail. But growth, my friends, is necessary if we want to evolve, if we want to better ourselves and others around us. So stop being so quick to say no and maybe lean into that yes a little more. You’d be amazed where it takes you. I think the after my.#growth #change #leadershiplessons #growthmindset #challengeyourself

I cannot emphasize this enough.  While it is true that functional teams cannot be composed wholly of leaders, at the same time it is leadership’s responsibility to identify and nurture those with potential, and raise them up to the next level.

Connect #6: Addicted to #Reflection, Committed to #growth So many people I know spend their entire week waiting for the weekend, and I’m no different. Those 36 hours from Friday evening to Monday morning bring smiles, new memories, precious family time and incredible moments for #selfreflection! I love my jobs, I love my career and I love how passionate I am each and every second that I am working, but the time over the weekend provides me with the amazing opportunity to gain perspective and understand why I do what I do.  Over the past 2 years like a lot of others, motivation for me was hard to come by… and through weekly reflection I was able to learn about myself and get back into a #growthmindset! I’m motivated by solving problems and by building quality relationships with the people I spend the most time with, and in each and every role I’m in; husband, father, director, coach, son, brother, I have the opportunity to be empathetic, compassionate and motivated to build relationships and help others develop solutions to solve problems. I’m truly blessed, and with the ability to do what I enjoy the most everyday, it allows me to really be the best version of myself.  I’m excited to be able to bring my passion and commitment for growth to my clients, players, family and friends. 6 weeks until 2023… a year of major evolution, growth and opportunity for me. A year I’m so eager to attack!  But hey.. why wait, why not start today! Let’s get after it together. Sincerely, your #RetailTrainingGuyDaniel

#leadership, #growthmindset, #gritI would like to share one of my master's lessons topic that I have combined with the below video as I've found it very useful & interesting to apply in everyday business life. Every organization needs employees who have GRIT, not high IQ's to achieve long-term objectives for both their personal and professional growth. Then, what is GRIT? It is the power of passion and perseverance for long-term objectives. How to make employees have GRIT is up to the leaders who have a Growth Mindset. Because it helps build grit. I would like to list the bullet points that clarify the working environment with a Growth Mindset. Those bullets points will help you to understand how it helps the employees have GRIT:* It will contribute to the team members' growth in their personal and professional while working together.* It will help create a learning environment people are open, fearless and empowered.* It will inject a sense of belonging to the organisation and the team.* It will help each team member to have the best daily experience that they behave as they are, free to focus, ready to create and innovate.

The most important skills for any team are the so-called "hard" skills, which have a relatively short half-life.They are the specific knowledge and abilities required to perform a particular task or activity. For example, a software engineer needs to know how to write code in order to be able to create new applications.However, these skills tend to become outdated relatively quickly, as new technologies and approaches are developed. As a result, it is important for teams to regularly invest in training and development in order to stay up-to-date.In contrast, "soft" skills are those personal qualities and abilities that remain essential for success over the long term.  Examples of soft skills include:• effective communication• time management• problem-solving, and• teamworkUnlike hard skills, soft skills do not have a half-life and can be applied in any number of different situations. As a result, they are critical for ensuring scalable growth and long-term success.When everyone on a team has these critical soft skills, there is a synergy that allows the team to reach its full potential. Don't neglect your soft skills; invest in them early and often to set yourself up for long-term success.#teameffectiveness #skillsofthefuture #growthmindset #leadership #management #success #futureofwork #futurereadyskills #goldenpointexecutives #staygolden

The first step is always the hardest. We’re usually restricted by our own fears of failure. But once we’ve taken that very first step, we break the chains that fear has wrapped us with. Once we’ve  pulled together all our courage and  taken that  first step,Everything else just falls into place smoother than we expected.And It turns out that reality isn’t as hard as we thought It’d be.

#Care. A much needed energy; in a sea of hybris and deceit.Being loving and kind. Not virtue signalling. Not merely pacifying oneself,with 'love and light', but filling yourself up with faith and confidence,that there is a way. Not merely stepping aside, because of fear of conflict,but to bundle your energy for the conflicts that matter.That are worthy of your care. No matter the odds.When having the faith and conviction that there is rarely any need to compete,because there is enough for everybody, we move into the mode of creation.Where odds only virtually matter. When stepping into authenticity,sovereignty, you move towards serenity.Since there is only you, who really can be you.A mode of being, which does however rely on extensive training.Through self-reflection, trial and error, messing up, falling down;exploring and transforming your character. An act of seeking wholeness.So as to be able to act as the conduit for appropriate actions,as well as concious non-action.Conduct, leading - with high likelyhood - towards the outcomes desired.Finding actions and reactions, which spring value as much for yourself,as for your environemnt. Not by force or coercion, not by redistribution,but freely chosen. Becoming invested, by #investing. #Leading, by actuallygoing onwards into uncertainty. Beholden to a #growthmindset.Infinite growth is not only possible; it is necessary.Just not as we currently discuss or imagine it.Obviously, a tree doesn't grow infinitly in height. Yet it grows as long as itcan in its complexity, as well as it's components and constituents.Every spring it regenerates the leaves, it has lost throughout the fall.Every year it puts on a new layer of skin; an annual growth ring.Encoding the wisdom, strife and challenges of that year. Life is growth.Life is faith in abundance. Life is trust in breaking through obstacles,so as to stretch one's roots deep into rich soil, and one's branches andleaves towards the light.Most limitations, most of the narrative of scarcity, is a myth.It is a story to keep flows of energy and efforts - products and profits -under control. Without alternative? Cui bono?Constricting, deceiving, distracting.Combined with fear, it produces a mixture in human psychology,leaving you in a perpetual state of survival. Addicted to externalities.Taking energy away from being able to plan long-term; shrinking your world,collapsing you. Then building walls of thoughts, emotions and memesaround you. Engulfing you under a veil of idiology.Using light to blind you, instead of illuminating the way.Nudging you ever farther away from who and what you want to be;and truly are.If we don't care, energies dissipate. To be picked up those, who do notcreate, but rather harvest. Beings - that for whatever reason - lost theirspark of creation. Relying on those who burn with passion and shine bright.To capture their spark; capture their light.(c) s.freiberg 2022

When I was growing up, anytime I would say I had to do something, my dad would say you don’t have to; you get to.As a teen, I would roll my eyes when he said this.I didn’t believe him and didn’t want to hear it.Now, as an adult, I realize how incredible that mindset shift can be.When you think, “I have to go to work today,”“I have to attend this meeting,”or “I have to have this difficult conversation with my employee,”It can feel frustrating or annoying.When you think, “Leading a team is a privilege.”You can start to see that you don’t have to do any of this.Your organization trusts you with this incredible role to be a manager.You are choosing to go to that meeting.You are choosing to engage your employees.You are choosing to go to work.You get this opportunity today.It doesn’t mean that this will always be your default mindset.When you pause and notice you don’t have to do anything today.You want to make an impact today.That can be an incredible shift.What helps you shift your mindset when you’re having a rough day? P.S. Enrollment is open! Sign up for the next Magnetic Leadership System by responding to this email and say sign me up!My director had a very positive experience in MLS. He was working 60-plus hour weeks which is not sustainable for anybody. Now he is more strategic and able to prioritize and plan to increase the throughput of work on important topics. This gives him more time to interact with others. And it's an exponential improvement in an organization because the leadership team affects everybody's work.Tallen- President #growthmindset #leadershipdevelopment #stem

🔥 Imposter Alert⚠️ When constantly nagged by the feeling of 'What if this doesn't work out?', make sure you also ask yourself 'What if it does?' 🤷🏻‍♀️When the fear of uncertainty, failure or the feeling of "I am not good enough!" (Imposter syndrome) kicks in , these 2 simple tools could come to your aid!Tool 1:🔧⚙️⭐ Ask yourself;✳️ Is there evidence for my fear, or am I making assumptions? (Check for facts, often it will give you clarity)✳️ What is the probability that my worst case materializes? (Estimate the probability by working out rough statistics. Most times you will find comfort in numbers and will give you a big picture view)✳️ What’s the best-case scenario?✳️ What’s most likely to happen?”Tool 2:🔧⚙️When starting up something new e.g. a new business, a role transition in professional or personal life⭐ Use the growth mindset mantra of " I am learning to_____"Example:✴️ “I feel I am not good enough, I am unable to get engagement on my posts” → “I’m learning to get better at it everyday”✴️ “I’m such a bad parent” → “I’m learning to care for an infant and transition into a new life”✴️ “I don’t know enough to manage people; I can’t do this” → “I’m learning to be a great manager”When you start seeing yourself as constantly learning & improving, you adopt a growth mindset. It will help you look at uncertainty as an opportunity to learn something new.The uncertainty could still be challenging but it wont be as scary to paralyse us or to put you down.Do ✍️ in  your thoughts or experiences in the comments. Hope this helps some of you.▶️ For 1:1 coaching & speaking engagements across mindset, career & leadership spheres DM me, let's talk!▶️ Follow me & hit the 🔔 on my profile to not miss out on my daily posts#mindset #growthmindset #impostersyndrome  #fearoffailure

And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."--Colossians 3:12-14Let's walk out our lives together, through the highs and the lows, and support one another as best as we can.

The past couple of weeks have been harder than usual.  At times it felt impossible, but amongst it all I've found moments of joy and happiness along with moments of quiet.  I am learning to embrace the paradox of life between thriving and struggle.⁠This is one of my mantras I turn to when life challenges me... ⁠⁠❣️This feels hard because it IS hard, not because I'm doing something wrong❣️⁠⁠This is self-compassion and the practice of it makes things feel difficult instead of impossible.  ⁠⁠I would love to hear one of your mantras.

The experience of failures, of falls, of rising again and again, of never NEVER using failure as an excuse to quit, but as your next starting place. Staggering, resistance, negative forces, things just plain outta-your-control, and finally planting yourself on the pinnacle of success. It's the reason life is fun!

Had a number of interactions this week that, once again,  inspire me to share more of my own #growthjourney.  Turns out, for me at least, that the more we are willing to share, the more we learn that “its not just me/us” and the more we can help each other and ourselves #bemore. This one shares a “formula” I have used to find my way through in those inevitable moments of doubt.   I’m no Einstein, but hope you find it a useful tool in your own growth#fakingitwhileyoufigureitout#bemore #bemoreofyou #dontbetheimposter #hereigoagain#growthjourney #growthmindset

How do you prepare for a new week?Do you leave it to chance or do you draw up a to-do list?Good for you if you have a detailed plan but chances are very slim that only a few will back that up with a "to-be list".As we rise in our careers, it's important that we also mark commendable strides and evident growth in our attitudes and character. Usually we have a long list of the things we want to accomplish within 24hours but we pay very little attention to the kind of person we hope to be as we cross off those achievements. Do you want to be the kind of leader that encourages unhealthy competition within teams or the kind that promotes togetherness in the completion of tasks?Do you want to be the kind of follower that sulks when you're being corrected? Or the kind that sees that their way is not always the best or only way. Character is key. As we work towards mastering skills and pursuing our goals; DOING all that we can to get to the top (wherever that is for you),  let's not forget the place of self mastery and the beauty of BECOMING. What character traits would you want to intentionally build this week? Patience? Empathy? Honesty? Confidence? What's on your "To-Be List"? This week is a good time to start!Have an intentional week!! #EdenSage #Growth #growthmindset #intentionality #RaisingLeaders #NewWeek

“No one wants the incompetent coworkers or employees on their team”.Sometimes I hear this in my head, Before beginning this adventure, I was aware that there was one thing I had to leave behind: the mindset of studying things only to get by but never truly comprehending them. I realized that this was a school culture that needed to change. A similar way of thinking could have gotten me through my university years, but it wouldn't carry me through life. I was aware that I needed to approach things with a pragmatic perspective. It will be my obligation to actually make things work rather than just think about how to accomplish it. I aspire to improve as a student, a doer, and a problem-solver as I move forward on this path.#growthmindset #100daysofcode #softwaredeveloper

"The effort is the reward"Most of us (myself included) look forward to the reward after doing something hard whether its a challenging week at work (weekend) or a cheat meal after a tough workout. I feel like this takes us away from the present moment a bit as well. We just want to get to the end.What about rewiring yourself to enjoy the hardest part of any activity? That itself is the dopamine trigger not the resulting reward.Check this out for more:https://bit.ly/3gjIRCz#personaldevelopment #personalgrowth #growthmindset #growthanddevelopment #productivity #mindfulness

A Sunday Mindfulness Reminder 🌼Not always do you need to be in the lap of mountains or standing on a river to feel mindful. When looking for success, turn it around easy and optimize the situation with what's available. That's what leaders do, don't we? This thought process of going on a perfect holiday, to feel complete, rewired, or rejuvenated only postpones the calmness that one can generate from within at any given point in time with the available resources. The real, consistent peace before everyday storm is the peace that one truly creates from within. All one possibly needs is an environmental push. A mindful space is thus a space that creates that little environment of serene peace that resonates with your own idea of calm and can be created in just about any corner of your home. A hack you wouldn't wanna miss. How do you like my new little mindful reading corner? Let me know in the comments below :) . . . #mindfulness #leadership #growthmindset #books #leaders #personaldevelopment #professionaldevelopment #sundaymotivation #whatinspiresme #productivity #hacks #meditation

Kaizen: The Japanese philosophy of Improvement. You don't have to be Invincible, you just have to be unstoppable.Every day is an opportunity to improve.The 1 Percent Rule:  Why a Few People Get Most of the Rewards.If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. (chart below)Because growth is exponential, the improvement is actually 10x greater.Over time the majority of the rewards in a given field will accumulate to the people, teams, and organizations that maintain a 1 percent advantage over the others.You don't need to be twice as good to get twice the results. You just need to be slightly better.The margin between good and great is narrower than it seems. What begins as a slight edge over the competition compounds with each additional contest.Be consistent and you'll be unstoppable!Momentum is a powerful force in nature you can harness by using the power of small consistent improvements.Rishad Ahmed 🙏❤️#emotionalintelligence #training #mentalhealth #growthmindset #psychology #emotionalintelligence #executivecoaching

When you are faced with a challenge, don't give up. Push yourself for that one more night, another month or another few years & just keep going! Don't say the words "I can't". Focus on "You Can" and figure out the next steps to take and develop your perseverance and resilience! That same challenge might not come up and you want to be able to say that you gave it all you had. You want to be proud that you made an achievement through pushing yourself and going as far as you could. Not be left with "I could have done better", "I wish I didn't give up".Good Luck To Everyone Overcoming A Challenge In The Foreseeable Future.

If we put a blindfold over our eyes and begin to walk around an open field, we would feel unsure with each step.We might be afraid of falling, fearful of walking over some unseen edge and hurting ourselves.When any of us face something and we don't know what the outcome will be, we often feel blindfolded.We fear we may get hurt. We fear we can't do it. We have a hard time trusting ourselves.A blind person often finds help or guidance from others or will gain confidence by walking on – slowly at first, finding trust and sureness with each step.These same things help us when we are afraid.It is also helpful to remember there is no right or wrong way to explore what faces us – only our own way.#selfcare #personalgrowth #growth #emotions #changeyourmindset #growthmindset🌱 #fear #wellness #selfgrowth #smile #growthmindset #elevate #positivevibes #selfawareness #selfdevelopment #mindfulness #mindsetshift #fearful #goals #healing #loveyourself #fearoffailure #growthjourney #mindsetmatters #feelings #emotionsmatter #mindset #personalgrowthjourney #strength #growing Hope Trust (Est. 2002)

People can: Acknowledge, Learn, Question, Understand, Classify, Resolve, Contextualize, Trace, Self-exculpate, Self-doubt, Self-defend, Deny, Project, Blame, Escalate, or Apologize. The first 8 and numbers 13 and 16 (Projecting and Apologizing) are all useful and responsible responses; the others less so. This infographic reminds me of someone I know who never apologizes for her mistakes and always finds someone to blame, and this has a huge impact on everyone around her. Do you know anyone like that? How do you, and the people you work (or live) with react when they make mistakes? And how can we learn to better approach mistakes with a growth mindset and create a culture at work where mistakes are handled in a positive way?

💡From Comfort Zone to the Growth Zone💡When leaving your comfort zone, fear shouldn’t always equate to being in the panic zone (even though sometimes it does). In the diagram 👇 we can see that fear can be a necessary step en route to the learning and growth zones:✅ It takes courage to step from the comfort zone into the fear zone. Without a clear roadmap, there’s no way to build on previous experiences. This can be anxiety provoking. Yet persevere long enough, and you enter the learning zone, where you gain new skills and deal with challenges resourcefully.After a learning period, a new comfort zone is created, expanding one’s ability to reach even greater heights. This is what it means to be in the growth zone.Don’t forget that moving into the growth zone is almost impossible without some level of self-awareness.Consider the following:⚡️ How big are your zones? Across every life domain, everyone’s zones vary in size. To leave your comfort zone, you must appreciate its outer limits. Similarly, you must develop an intuitive sense of where your panic zone lies. Taking on challenges that lie somewhere in between will stretch you, leading to growth and learning.⚡️ What are your strengths? Understanding and capitalizing on personal strengths can be of great use. Most people have experienced leaving the comfort zone in at least one area of life, and there are usually plenty of insights to be uncovered from this experience.In reality, the process of moving from the comfort zone to a growth zone may not be linear. Peaks, troughs, and plateaus often complicate the journey. Sometimes, we even need to retreat to the comfort zone periodically before mustering the strength to leave again. ✅ I want to emphasize that appreciating the steps can help in tolerating uncertainty and enjoying any journey.Image source: PositivePsychology.com#linkedinbyBebekaCosandey #growthmindset #selfawareness #lifefficiency #emotionalintelligence #personalknowledgemanagement

It's stressful building a company from the ground up.But when I have doubts, I read these texts from a former boss. They remind me: - You're just a number to a company, don't take it personal- Health will always be more important than work- Never give up on creating the life I want- Keep betting on yourself- I was expendableAt the time, I was focused on being more present, so I turned off notifications on weekends. If you don't put your health first, no one else will... regardless of how much someone thinks they're paying you.🖤p.s. it was indeed a 9-5 #health #personaldevelopment #mentalhealth #growthmindset #happiness

Dit weekend zijn we tijdens de #mindsetles aan de slag gegaan met de termen #groeidenken en #vastdenken. De kinderen konden na afloop van verschillende uitspraken aangeven of dit hoort bij groei- of vastdenken. Ook hebben de kinderen nagedacht over situaties uit hun leven waarin ze te maken hebben gehad met vastdenken of juist groeidenken. Het was een praktische ochtend met wijze lessen. Motto van vandaag: "Als je gelooft dat je kan leren, groeien en ontwikkelen dan kan je inderdaad ook veel bereiken."#deweekendjuf #obspwa #denhaag #mindset #hetbrein #groeidenken #vastdenken #vaardigheden #levensvaardigheden #groeien #caroldweck #growthmindset #groeimindset

Dear #creative,To grow, you NEED to remove the need to be validated through: likes, shares, comments, follows, etc.The quest for rating one's creativity and  #value based on vanity metrics is bad.It'd weaken your uniqueness, and kill your creative ability, slowly.Don't do it.It's sad to know that many smart creatives have stopped sharing value because.... they don't get likes, or engagements - after trying for a few times.It doesn't have to be so.Posting as a form of #self-expression removes the burden of expectations or validations.Write.Express yourself.Share your experience, mood, or lessons - to help others out there.Your words/posts may be all they need to read to:- inspire- motivate, or- push them to take action that'd help improve their lives, business, or careers.#Write something that #inspires you - and share it - it might inspire someone out there too.Remember, you are unique.Don't compare yourself or your journey with other people's.Nothing beats the sweet feeling of living your life and expressing yourself freely WITHOUT expectations, or hope of getting validated.Stay Sharp,Samuel******Follow 🌍Samuel Efe Obrikogho 🗣✍🏾  for more effective tips on copywriting, marketing, business growth, and personal development.Would you like to engage with your prospects, convert them to repeat buyers, and multiply your business's revenue?Send me a DM to get started.#creative #growthmindset #personaldevelopment #SamuelWrites

Which shift do you think is most important for growing leaders?For me, I would say that it is shifting from only thinking about today to thinking about the future.Moving into a coaching mentality is a strong second. I think that so often people become leaders without realizing that the way they think about things has to change. They are usually awesome at doing things (which is why they get promoted) and think they can just ‘add leadership’ to their to do list. But delegation is hard and coaching takes a lot of time and empowering doesn’t come naturally. These shifts are hard!And every leadership role will require a different balance on each scale. That’s why they are sliding scales.  Ideally you will always be moving those sliders as far to the right as possible. But depending on the season or role, they may shift back. So leaders, what is one of these sliders you need to move to the right? #leadership #leadershiplessons #growthmindset #sketchnotes

I'm excited to share that the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet, https://www.in.gov/gwc/, released recommendations to tackle employer talent challenges and accelerate the state’s economy of the future, for consideration by Governor Holcomb and the Indiana General Assembly ahead of the 2023 legislative session. The recommendations focus on solutions to critical workforce and education challenges Indiana is experiencing, and provides solutions to help employers find workers, remove barriers and prepare the future workforce.The recommendations are a collective effort of the Cabinet – 31 statewide members including business and community leaders, education representatives from K-12 and postsecondary institutions, Indiana lawmakers and experts from state agencies. Members are appointed by the Governor and represent Indiana’s 12 economic growth regions.  The 2022 GWC Recommendations can be found at: https://lnkd.in/g7rqzZgQ#economyofthefuture #workforce #teamindiana #growthmindset

Wanna know what I’m not here for? 🥴Victim mentality. Excuses. Passing the blame.Not. Here. For. It. 🗣🎶☝🏼 I have had ALLLLL of the reasons to choose victimhood, come up with excuses as to why I couldn’t do the things I needed to do, and to blame others for my lack of successes and my failures in my journey…… But I didn’t.I chose to hold onto my power, hold myself accountable and take responsibility.I chose to be the heroine of my story. 🧞‍♀️✨We get to lead ourselves to the success that we want in life, whatever that looks like to us.We get to show up for ourselves & our future.We get to step into our power and radiate in strength.No one else is going to create what we want for us.So we must choose to do it for ourselves.And THAT’S what I’m here for…… People who lead themselves. 🔥People who choose to be the Warrior Goddesses (or Gods) of their life.And trust me when I say… you’re more powerful than you currently realise. 🥰#ChooseYourself #GrowthMindset #Succeed #ShowUpForYourself #CreateYourFuture

Pre-Release copy given out and the feedback has been omazing… Standby for Amazon link release next week…. Last chapter, shares a FB private message from my high school teammate Damien Palanza that changed everything for me. This simple act of kindness, way back then, set everything in motion. I’ve never shared this before and want to share it with all those that loved him as well. Hey Joe, I just wanted to say that I'm proud that you are so focused. I have been looking for the right time to bring this up, you remember the Barnstable game? The time Mant fumbled and the ball was on the ground? You were the only one that could pick up the ball and run with it? There was so much on the line in that game with Sean and all and you didn't think, you reacted and you did what was necessary for us to win. At the time that score was the single most important thing in our lives, the coaches lives, shit, the towns lives and you had the ability to rise to the occasion and put everything on your back and win that shit for US. I know that life is way more than football but when I see your writing on here and how inspired you are I automatically think of that game, that situation where you said fuck it, I'm going to win, a curveball was thrown and you just took the ball and ran and you fucking won us that game. I just wanted you to know that you are a natural winner, your place is in the winners circle and no fumble or roadblock can stop you. I was proud to call you a teammate then and I will always be proud to call you a friend. This may be corny, especially since you know me and I am never corny but I want nothing more than to see you back on top because I know, I was there, I know that your core is good and that you are a winner. Just wanted to let you know that for what it's worth I am in your corner and I know. I straight up fucking KNOW that you are solid as a rock.You've turned fumbles into touchdowns before Joe, DO IT AGAIN.RIP Bud and thank you 🖤💙❤️ #amazon #writing #kindness #growth #entrepreneur #growthmindset #coaching #mindfulness #goals #mentalhealth #selfdevelopment #motivationalquotes #positivevibes #fyp #foryourpage #trending #personaldevelopment #personaldevelopmentcoach

Appreciating the "why" will enable you to face any "how". Appreciative inquiry gets us to consider what motivates us to do our work, before looking at what and how. It also allows us to set realistic goals for ourselves based on our aspirations and with practice, embed behaviours that drive the change we're looking for. Ask yourself these 4 questions and consider discussing them with your manager or mentor.

According to Harvard Business Review universities need to focus more on soft skills - because AI is disrupting the jobs that are focused on intellectual capabilities alone (but employees still need critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills and deep knowledge in a subject/major.)Per HBR:"...universities could substantially increase the value of the college degree if they spent more time teaching their students critical soft skills. Recruiters and employers are unlikely to be impressed by candidates unless they can demonstrate a certain degree of people-skills. This is perhaps one of the biggest differences between what universities and employers look for in applicants. While employers want candidates with higher levels of EQ, resilience, empathy, and integrity, those are rarely attributes that universities nurture or select for in admissions. As the impact of AI and disruptive technology grows, candidates who can perform tasks that machines cannot are becoming more valuable — and that underscores the growing importance of soft skills, which are hard for machines to emulate."*******In my opinion universities need to focus more on the APPLICATION of knowledge i.e. don't just teach Organizational Behavior, Organizational Change Management and other people-oriented subjects, connect the dots to how the concepts are used in the  workplace.  So, for example, teach influencing, body language, meeting planning/facilitation, empathy, listening --- these are essential business skills.  And Harvard thinks so too.#peopleskills #softskills #essentialskills #businessskills #empathy #listening #organizationalchangemanagement #resilience #adaptability #agility #growthmindset #servantleadership

If you're uncertain about what you want, your motivation is going to reflect that. I see this with clients all the time. One day, you're staying in your job. The next day, you're ready to quit and walk out the door. And this back & forth makes it super hard to get started on anything. Why work your a$$ off if you're just going to quit? Why clean up your resume if you're not going anywhere? The action is messy, because the the clarity is all over the place. Make a decision. Even if it's just for 90 days. Commit yourself to one path fully & see how it lands in your body.And if you can't get clear, have resistance to committing yourself or taking any action- snap up one of my Procrastinator Calls. .....#leadership #careercoach #motivation #selfdevelopment #selfimprovement #mindset #mindsetcoach #success #personalgrowth #personaldevelopment #selfcare #purpose #careerchange #lifecoachforwomen #growthmindset #empowerment #coachinglife #careercoaching #careercounseling #jobsearch #burnout #burnoutcoach #corporateburnout #burnouttips #worklifebalance #burnoutrecovery #burnoutisreal #burnoutsyndrome

Hello all, Fanis here:"So, what can I do for you?"Great question right? Why am I here?Let's not worry about my certifications, I've mentioned those before.I'd prefer to speak about how I can help you and the results.I see people for many types of behaviors, some suffer from insomnia, addictions, lack of confidence, self-esteem, worthiness, and self-love just to name a few.I am not a shiny object found here on the net, I'm purely results-based. Your positive outcome is my only concern.I use many methods to achieve these outcomes: Hypnotherapy, Timeline Therapy and NLP.I use a hybrid approach to therapy, each session is purely customized to my client's specific needs.THERE ARE NO SCRIPTS HERE!I use your words to achieve profound and permanent results, as well as metaphors, analogies, stories, and of course powerful suggestions.Some of my work is completed in a non-hypnotic state, you will be surprised (or not surprised) by just how powerful this is.I'll be posting more about what to expect from me moving forward.DM me personally or click the link in my bio to find out just how powerful my approach is.https://lnkd.in/efXy6AAsI look forward to chatting with you.With love,Fanis Makrigiannis | C.Ht, MNLP | Mind Spirit Body Hypnosis #fanismakrigiannis #mindspiritbodyhypnosis #hypnosis#love #beautiful #happy #beauty #smile #motivation #inspiration #heal #healthy #happiness #me #life #success #hypnosisnearme #selflove #confidence #wellness #health #mentalhealth #mindset #linkinbio #explore #quitsmoking #therapy #onlinetherapy #growthmindset

Are you a new immigrant in Canada and finding it challenging to win job interviews to land a great job offer ?Newcomers to Canada often face difficulty finding good jobs. There are a number of reasons why this may be the case. For one, many immigrants are not familiar with the Canadian job market and may not have enough job interview experience to impress hiring managers. Additionally, they may not have a strong network of contacts to help them find work. Language barriers can also be a major obstacle, as many immigrants are not fluent in English. If you're looking for a new job, you'll want to make sure you're prepared for the interview process. Successful interviews are all about being well-prepared. Even if you're the most qualified applicant, your lack of confidence  will undermine your chances of getting the job offer. We have got great news for you. We will show new Canadian immigrants how to quickly and easily win job interviews to get hired for great positions.Join us for an upcoming webinar where we will reveal industry SECRETS to help you ace the interview and quickly land a terrific job offer. We'll show you the ONE factor that makes or breaks your chances of getting hired for a job, and you'll be SHOCKED.https://lnkd.in/gi7iVr43#gethired #jobinterviews #beconfident #newimmigrants #dreamjob #seizethemoment #growthmindset #careeradvice #jobseekerssupport

🔰🔰🔰 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀? The impact of a strong dollar on your ecommerce business all depends on where you source your goods from and which markets you sell in. If you import from areas like Europe or Asia and you sell in the US, the strong dollar could help you make more sales.This is because when the dollar is strong, it means that goods imported into the US are relatively cheap. Ecommerce sellers who export from countries with weaker currencies into the US can take advantage of the strong dollar to price their goods lower & encourage people to buy more. So, if you sell on US platforms and have funds in USD, it’s a good idea to top up stock levels now, while your dollar has more buying power.On the other hand, if you’re exporting from the US or trying to sell US-made goods in overseas markets, the strong dollar will make it harder for you to grow your business. When the USD is strong, commodities are more expensive in local currency in real terms, which lowers demand. That’s why US-based brands like Apple and Procter & Gamble are currently seeing sales drop🎗 Follow for more key information and learning.#currency #sales #europe #markets #dollar #Ecommerce #ecombusiness #money #entrepreneurskills #growthmindset #businessdevelopment #digitalamarketing #emailmarketing #learninganddevelopment #emailcopywriter #personalbranding #businessstrategist #businessbranding #businessstrategy #businessstrategist #CopywriterForHire #emailcopywriter #freelancing #freelancinggoals #freelancermarketing #salessecrets #salesandmarketing #marketingsecrets #secretsofsuccess #successsecrets #copywriterlife #copywritingtips #copywritinglife #howtogetclients #highpayingskills #copywriterforhire

We all want to be rich but the path to riches is the most difficult hurdle you have to overcome, to become rich we all try various practices and read multiple motivational books. In recent times the trend of the "Millionaire Routine" has become extremely popular. And if you have dreams of improving your family’s financial situation, finding extra hours in the day to dedicate to making money can sometimes seem impossible.But the reality is that millionaires and billionaires have the same 24 hours in a day as everyone does! The difference between a standard morning routine and a millionaire morning routine is that millionaires know how to make the most of their time. From creating a routine that makes their morning run more smoothly to developing habits that further them in their career, millionaires have developed a way of life many of us strive to live. But the question is- Does this routine work in a real-life scenario? there are millions of people who have adopted the routine but yet the results are not as per expectation and the expectation is to be a millionaire or even witness a modest income growth. Why do you think this is happening?Feel free to share your own thoughts on Sociomix.Sociomix is the happiest place on the internet, where we encourage you to share your thoughts, opinions, unique perspectives, and ideas on different topics you deeply care about.
