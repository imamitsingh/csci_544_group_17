What do I do as a Business Consultant? 🤔💭Being a Business Consultant is sometimes like a marriage counselor between the business owner and the business/their team. As an outsider, I’m able to ask the necessary questions that need to be asked, without the repercussions. And I absolutely love being able to help my clients. However, some days go super smooth, we work on the planned agenda, and on other days, we pivot and work on what is the most pressing issue for the client.When things come up in your business, we take a look at what the problem is. Is it around a process? Is it around a person? Then we brainstorm ways to move forward in navigating that problem.You see, everything is connected in an organization. Your strategy should be developed using processes, people, and technology. Issues will always arise. It is discovering where the roadblock is, and developing a plan forward.

Did you know the founder of Calendly had many failed businesses before launching this wildly popular app?One of his failures was an online grill e-tailer. He later admitted “I didn’t even own a grill, I lived in an apartment and had no interest in grilling.”But there was one interest that struck a chord. Time management. Formerly, as a sales rep early in his carrier he noticed the friction and extra communication when booking a meeting with a prospect.So naturally, this was a problem he could emphasize with and went to work solving it.This is an important part of your product/service in business, being able to empathize and relate to your prospective customers.It's exponentially harder solve for a pain point you haven't felt before.It's getting infinitely more difficult to "hack" a certain industry you are not a part of (in which there is "perceived" potential). Why? Because there are already communities and conversations happening and the market can offer immediate feedback.Resonate with your audience, immerse yourself in a community. You will find success there.#community #painpoint #resonate

“A problem well stated is a problem half-solved” - Charles KetteringNothing can describe #uxwriting better than this! Given the low average attention spans, capturing and holding visitors' attention is a challenging task. Examine a bit more and you’ll see it is essentially about presenting and highlighting the #painpoint as simply as possible. Customers should be able to relate to the issue being addressed the moment they read your copy. Expert tip: When it comes to UX writing, follow the three Cs of Clarity, Consistency, and Conciseness in your design to reduce ambiguity. The weighted importance of crisp writing cannot be understated when measured against other #uxdesignprinciples (curious about other principles? take a look at the comment with this post)

So pleased to have completed the second course in the 7-Courses series of the Google Professional Certificate in UX Design! 🤓😊As a UX designer, it'll be my job to always put the user first in everything I do. It was so interesting to explore the importance of research in the design process to better understand and empathize with users. It was tough to have to really question all my assumptions about the user's needs and instead focus on authentically understanding what the user ACTUALLY needed. These needs are often not as obvious are I previously thought, and only when I approached the table with my proverbial "cup" emptied out was I ready to REALLY listen and actually HEAR what they had to say.This course taught me so much about the "Empathize, Define, and Ideate" process and the various User Research methods! Biases in UX Design is another aspect of UX design that forced me to stop and re-evaluate how I thought about user needs and design. It really forced me to be more aware of the patterns and shortcomings of the human mind that could lead me to draw incorrect conclusions about the end-user's needs. Learning about User Pain Points was amazing because it offered an opportunity to solve REAL problems that REAL users face in REAL life! The concept of Accessible and Inclusive Design was something that came as a shock because I realized that I'd never really thought about it before. It is so important to think about those of us who are even a little different from what society considers the norm and ensure that they are included and that their needs are met just the same as those who are the norm.  I strongly believe that inclusive design should be at the center of all design. Not only can it improve the quality of life of the marginalized, but it also leads to useful technological solutions for all! One such example of Accessible Technology is the Voice Search feature a lot of us use.Empathy maps, Personas, User Stories, User Journey Maps, Problem Statements, Value Propositions, and Competitive Audits were some of the amazing tools that the course equipped me with, and all of them were so thoughtfully designed to help UX designers build Usable, Equitable, Enjoyable, and Useful products! By far the coolest tools I learned to use were "How Might We?" and "Crazy Eights"! I had so much fun with these. I can't imagine how much more fun it would be to use these in a team of designers during a Brainstorming session!  🤓😍😍  I completed this course a while ago (Feb) actually, but life got in the way of this post, and I guess, it's time when it's time! Cheers! 😊#inclusivedesign #accessibledesign #painpoints #painpoint #userstories #userstory #userjourney #valueproposition #equitable #design #userexperiencedesign #experiencedesign #uxdesign #interactiondesign #interfacedesign #productdesign #branddesign #designer #ux #designers #learning #google #visualdesign #secondcareer #multipotentialite #newadventure #newbeginning #2022goals

You know when you are in the flow.It is not about being perfect. The aim is to constantly improve in all that you do daily.Finding ways to peak mentally & physically is a never-ending journey and at times you will peak and on other days you may struggle but that really does not matter. Be thankful for your struggling days as these are the days you really learn what is you do and how what you do can be improved. So, learn to be mindful when it seemingly comes together as you are about to take great strides in your performance.I deliver workshops on finding your flow in what you do daily.Here is a take from my 1984 documentary discussing what it feels like to experience flow.#painpoint #painpointcoach #flow #mindset

What type of outreach is working best for you right now?I must hear this question 4 or 5 times a day, either in a discovery meeting or someone reaching out to me on LinkedIn. But, unfortunately, I can't give them an answer.What needs to be done next is a problem-centric discovery conversation. First, I have to understand the root cause of this question and what consequences they face from the problem.  At this point, the conversation can go two ways. They tell me what they are experiencing, or they want to hear from me what my SDRs are doing for outreach and not allow me to diagnose what's wrong.It doesn't matter which way they answer the question because it gives me an idea of how much pain they are in. This enables me to develop more qualified leads and forecast more accurately. How do you answer what outreach is working best for you?#develop #painpoint #forecasting

PERFECTIONISM- No. Nein. Näo.If innovators would wait for the perfect time, no innovation would take place. And if they attempted to overcome all possible objections before even taking the first step, they would never start.Chasing perfection in this digitally transformative world is the bottleneck to progress, reminds Divya Kaushal.In our weekly catchup, Divya mentioned how often she hears entrepreneurs holding themselves waiting for the right time, the right resources , the right business plan and the right everything- only to forever be waiting.Businesses should thoroughly understand the customer #painpoint it wishes to address and then get methodical about achieving that goal.

We hear it again and again. Problems with reports!Reports are crucial when you use data to make informed decisions. And so many times, getting the reports causes major problems for companies. 👉The reports time out👉They take a long time to run👉The data is not always accurateGenerating reports is a two-step process:✅Massaging the data✅Using the data to create the reportThe issue is that both parts are using the same database. This makes the process very heavy and it can slow down the entire system. Companies come to us with these issues of slow and inaccurate reports. Our solution: 👉Two mirrored databases - one for crunching the data, and one for generating the report. When the data is ready in database 1, it’s mirrored in database 2, which is read-only. The implementation of this solution is not always simple, but the idea is, and we’ve used it to help many clients address their problems with reports. Follow #CiderConsulting for great info on systems, software, and business#PainPoint #Report#Systems

Being in Flow brings you satisfaction, and feelings of elation and enriches your creativity. It's about being completely immersed in your life as you live it.We know as humans that to achieve what we truly want, especially in the workspace, we need purpose and passion, albeit in a balanced measure. But how do we find that perfect balance between purpose and passion that connects us to our Flow? Practice.Hear me out… I often talk about the happiest people being the ones who spend more time than others in a state of Flow. That for me defines success.Flow is very much in the experience and that’s how I translate what is traditionally a theoretical subject. And once you’ve experienced it, it feels immense, yet you feel calm in your concentration and focus. Being in Flow is about being in the moment, a feeling you will have mastered if you meditate and practice mindfulness.  Some say it’s like learning to swim or driving a car. It takes patience and practice. The more you practice the less effort you'll need. The less effort, the more naturally you fall in tune with your Flow.#flow #coordination #control #empowerment #painpointcoach

Will Cannon is a serial #entrepreneur with proven repeat success. He's the founder of UpLead and Signaturely, both of which he grew to success with adoption from mega-companies such as Google , Amazon , Microsoft , and Dropbox. He recently sat down with SaaS Mag to share his journey and offer advice to other entrepreneurs grinding their way to success. Here are 11 takeaways:   1) An early start:  🔘 Will’s founder journey began at 19 when he launched a real estate company. Next, he then started a B2B marketing agency focused on customer acquisition.  2) First #painpoint 🔘 Smaller companies wanted high-quality leads that were often out of their price range.  🔘 Verifying email lists required costly manpower, so Will decided to create an affordable solution. He hired a team to develop a tool that could automate the process.  3) Second pain point 🔘 When signing documents, he felt the available e-signature platforms were too complex.  🔘 Will hired developers to create an unfussy solution that allows users to easily upload documents and sign them.  4) Ideal customer 🔘 #UpLead and #Signaturely focus on creating valuable but affordable solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses.5) Product-market fit 🔘 Customers quickly adopted UpLead and Signaturely because they were developed from an existing market gap.  6) Grow from an MVP 🔘 Will recommends that you release your products as soon as you have a minimum viable product to attain potentially game-changing feedback early on. 7) Competitor feedback 🔘 Will and his team researched competitors and implemented changes based on their findings.  🔘 Look for features that could improve your product, such as a smooth onboarding process, setup wizard, or added benefits.  8) Look at reviews 🔘 Will and his team looked at competitors' negative reviews, found the dissatisfied individuals on LinkedIn, and encouraged them to try their product. It worked.  9) Diversified CACs 🔘 A single algorithm change can knock a business from page one into oblivion--taking all viable customers with it.  🔘 To avoid that, Will recommends diversifying your traffic sources and adds, "At the end of the day, you want most of your customers to come to you from word of mouth." 10) Scale your business 🔘 Test anything related to your company and its operation, such as products, pricing, and landing pages.  🔘 Make a few minor improvements at a time, such as conversion rate optimization and performing one-week tests for various adjustments.  11) Hire the right people 🔘 Take time to hire the right employees, especially if you’re building a big business.  Find the article linked in the first comment below to get more tips from Will Cannon!

This week McCarthy Browne are exploring a common business pain point: organisational confusion. Managing a team of employees, no matter if in the hundreds or just a few, requires each and every member of staff having a well-defined role. A weakness in the chain of command can result in numerous problems within a business due to poor communication, including poor performance, inefficient decision making and confusion amongst staff.Organisational confusion can arise due to company strategies not aligning to company goals, multiple priorities conflicting within the business, and the process of decision making becoming too complex. Proactive management can help address these issues, with the following tips being a good place to start:- Investigate your decision making process. Are complex procedures slowing down strategic planning and holding you back against competitors? Be sure your processes are simple, clear and streamlined.- Reflect upon your stakeholders. Are their goals cohesive with your business goals and strategies? It is vital that everyone involved with your company is on the same page in order to progress forward.- Avoid mixed messages: If you verbally instruct staff to do something but fail in enforcing this, it is likely your employees will not take instructions seriously. Ensure you communicate expectations clearly and take necessary action to enforce these.- Align all activities with your mission statement: In order for employees to perform to their best potential they need to understand how their role contributes towards the bigger picture of the company as a whole. Make sure job roles have clarity and detail regarding impact on revenue and profit. - Regularly provide staff feedback: Senior staff must be responsible in providing feedback to staff, including areas in which employees are excelling, meeting expectations, and where improvement is needed. Be sure to praise staff but to also gently highlight where performance has fallen short.The above points illuminate how confusion in the workplace is often created within the company itself! By streamlining processes, being concise when giving instructions and by making goals clear, organisational confusion can be greatly cleared and your mission statement will be increasingly attainable!#toptips #smallbusiness #painpoint #feedback #bookkeeper #bookkeeping #accountancy #accounting #business #finance #profit #revenue #staff #employees #bhfyp

Behind every successful team and organization is a strong culture, great leadership, and passionate, committed people. Agree???One of the most important qualities in building a strong team is entrusting and empowering one another through correct delegation whereas leaders give employees responsibilities with clear and concise direction and support.Team members should use their various skills and talents to achieve organizational goals. If you are a leader, remember this: you shouldn't do all the work, even if you can. However, as a leader, you should absolutely guide your team members along the way. Giving your team members tasks to complete that align with their skill set is extremely important.Now that you know the importance of empowering your people thru delegating them, you might ask yourself "how can you do it?"Click the link this link to list down the 3 ways how you can delegate your team members for greater empowerment: https://lnkd.in/g634X9pm.........#business #smallbusiness #businessconsultant #businessdevelopment #businessmindset #coach #leads #marketing #leadership #marketingstrategies #sales #messaging #client #employee #painpoint #engage #improve #positivemindset #selfawareness #mindfulness #entrepreneurship #inspiration #leadgeneration #continuallearning #reskilling #upskilling #development #professionaldevelopment #mentorship

I PAIN POINTSI punti dolenti, o pain point, sono problemi reali che il tuo pubblico o i tuoi consumatori stanno vivendo. Questi problemi si concretizzano principalmente attraverso le lamentele, i tassi di abbandono rispetto al tuo e-commerce, oppure la semplice e banale frustrazione di non avere abbastanza informazioni per procedere con l’acquisto sul tuo sito.Lo studio che riguarda i pain point è molto ampio, tanto da coinvolgere attivamente enti di ricerca, come la Consumer Federation of America, che ogni anno si impegna a indagare su quali possano essere i principali punti di dolore dei consumatori, attraverso indagini e interviste. In base ai dati degli ultimi anni, uno dei principali fattori che per gli utenti assume toni negativi, costituendo un punto di dolore, è la comunicazione fuorviante. Il pubblico si sente ingannato dalle pubblicità che non sono veritiere, oppure dalle informazioni nascoste.

so, I made a post about the windows eleven file options and how it has increased the number of click I have to perform to unzip my files using winrar, some are of the notion that why use a third party #software since the windows 11 came with an extract all feature. Well, #windows 11 extract all feature is very limited and doesn't really attend to all the possible #user needs and Essential #painpoint  of being able to extract multiple zip files at the same time.in this video, I did a #usabilitytesting of the feature and it's clearly lacking, so am definitely stressed....

Hai mai sentito parlare di #PainPoint? Sono quei "punti di frizione" che rischiano di chiudere la porta in faccia ad un potenziale cliente.

Il "primo e unico corso completo in Italia"🤔Ogni giorno mi capitano tra le mani headline di questo tipo relative a corsi online dello stesso settore.Come appaiono a me, appaiono anche ad altri “pesci” nel web🐟E un pesce come me non abbocca più perché tutti si elevano allo status di “primo e unico in tutta Italia” e nessuno è più credibile.La tua esca deve attirare in modo efficace il pesce, giusto?Il banco di pesci non deve sgamare subito la tua esca, altrimenti è l’incubo😨Quindi, al posto di questa super usata e super pompata headline puoi usare queste idee:1️⃣Scrivi una headline sulla base del pain point principale del tuo cliente ideale2️⃣Poni una domanda che crea curiosità nel tuo settore3️⃣Descrivi in breve il futuro del cliente nel caso in cui non seguirà i tuoi consigli4️⃣Usa statistiche reali nella headline per dargli urgenzaLo so cosa stai pensando:“Ma allora perché la usano tutti? Evidentemente funziona, no?”Ma quanto funziona?E per quanto funzionerà?Difatti:1️⃣Non sta convertendo al massimo del suo potenziale2️⃣Tra poche settimane potrebbe non essere più efficace3️⃣Non stai parlando direttamente al lettore ma stai parlando del tuo corso.A nessuno interessa se il tuo corso è il migliore in circolazione. Al lettore interessa se tu puoi risolvere un suo determinato problema.Una volta che ragioni come un pesce e non più come un pescatore, saprai cosa scrivere✔️Non sei sicuro che il copy del tuo corso online funzioni?Contattami subito e saprò come aiutarti.#copywriting #copy #b2c #b2b #marketingb2b #marketingdigitale #businessonline #venditaonline #vendita #business #persuasione #comunicazione #copytips #headline #corso #corsionline #scrivere #scriverepervendere #painpoint #cliente #salespage #landingpage

I'm doing research in the field of Video Communications to help facilitate people's needs, and I'm trying to understand what some of the TOP pain points or frustrations are when it comes to getting in front of a Camera and communicating effectively.We all have zoom calls, online meetings, we're guest speakers on webinars, online presentations and we ALL have some frustrations that get in the way! Sometimes it has nothing to do with 'US' but instead, tech issues get in the way... I'd love to hear about these aspects as well, so if this is your case, could you include some details pertaining to this pain in the comments below.If instead the issue at hand is more what your company will lose by not having an effective video communications strategy, then I'd love to hear about that also - please include a comment below, I'd really appreciate it!

The supply chain is going to be a big #painpoint for CXOs worldwide this year and for the next few years. I see significant IT budgets getting invested in building resilience and adaptability within the #supplychain .#digitaltransformation #weeklyupdates #220423 (View in browser: https://bit.ly/3xOgEKt)Here are some supply chain developments this week:- SAP announced Q1 results. Christian Klein, SAP CEO: "Customers powered another quarter of strong cloud growth as they turned to us for solutions to make their businesses more sustainable, supply chains more resilient, and enterprises more future-proof. - Rajesh Gopinathan, TCS CEO, said Cyber security, building supply chains, various forms of data protection, and sovereignty-related issues would emerge as "big drivers for technology spend globally. - Kraft Heinz and Microsoft join forces to accelerate supply chain innovation in a broader digital transformation.#sustainability #supplychain #EV: The semiconductor supply shortage has thrown the global auto industry off balance. But a much greater shock is coming through #evbattery supply issues. The key challenge areas are the availability of raw materials (such as #lithium, #cobalt, & #nickel ), mining capacity, and processing. Lithium prices have already gone through the roof, and lithium is not scarce.Compact SUVs overtake hatchbacks as the most popular Indian car types: This change is one of the most significant #automobileindustry  changes in the last few decades. Probably, we are not asking 'kitna deti hai?' as much as we used to. Following macros manifest in this shift: First, The change in #consumerbehavior due to the rising per capita GDP (every milestone crossed in per capita GDP gives rise to the different industry segments boom and changing customer preferences). Second, more accessible financing options (thanks to all NBFCs-led credits). Third, #SupplyChain issues - SUVs with higher price tags help automakers to cover the cost of the global #chipshortage .Serving the under-served: Fundraise this week for MSME loans providers- Moneybox Fin ($15M fundraise) offers small-ticket loans to dairy farmers and shop owners. - Kinara Capital ($50M fundraise) provides collateral-free MSME loans within 24 hours. So far, the company has disbursed Rs.3,000 cr across 75,000 collateral-free business loans. Future of Work - The availability of high-speed internet through satellite will significantly impact the future of many industries: When a reliable internet is omnipresent and is available in every Indian village, it will change the future of many industries. Tata's Nelco & Telesat has already sought DoT's nod for an experimental license. In addition, Bharti has backed British satellite internet service provider OneWeb in the same space. This week, the telecom regulator TRAI suggested further enabling guidelines for the space.Thought of the week: "We suffer more in imagination than in reality." - Seneca.

#PainPoint Intersection #Analytics and Human-Centered #Solution Design are needed more in #healthcare to help improve the experience of care for patients and caregivers.During a #college tour this week with our daughter, one school identified a commonly shared dual pain point for all of us in college previously: #paying for each laundry load with quarters and #knowing where the open washers and dryers are near us on campus to minimize wait times.This college identified this shared pain point intersection among their students and updated their human-centered #design to eliminate the laundry counting quarters challenge that many of us have experienced by removing the “pay by laundry load” pain point. They also created an app with location based real-time identification of open washers and dryers nearby.#Imagine if we consistently used pain point intersection analytics in #healthcare to better understand and improve the care experience for patients and caregivers? #WhyNot The #PainPoint intersections reveal the #CollectiveValue creation opportunities. #HumanCenteredDesign #Healthcare

Tüm tasarımlar doğru soruyu sormak ile başlar!Doğru soruyu tasarlamak; tasarımın kendini ortaya çıkarmak için atılması gereken en temel adımdır. Bunu gerektiği gibi tamamlayabilirseniz; bana göre kendinizi #tasarım sürecinin yarısını başarıyla tamamlamış kabul edebilirsiniz.#DesignThinking yaklaşımı özünde doğru soruları sormaya yarayan bir metottur. Derin bir empati ile #persona larınızı tanıyıp, en doğru acı noktayı ( #PainPoint ) tanımlamak ile ilerleyen bir süreçtir. Sonrasında ise, tanımladığınız problemi kullanıcılar üzerinde farklı prototipler ile test ederek gerekli öğrenme çıktılarını elde edersiniz…Tasarım süreci dendiğinde aklımıza onlarca şey gelse de ben Design Thinking yaklaşımı ile ele alınabilecek farklı tasarım türlerinden bahsetmek istiyorum.1. Kullanıcı Deneyimi Tasarımı ( #UXDesign )Ürün ya da servislerinizi geliştirirken kullanıcı beklentilerini, davranışlarını ve ürününüz ile kurdukları etkileşimi doğru anlamak; #sürdürülebilirlik açısından oldukça önemlidir. Süreçlerin farklı boyutlarında çözmeniz gereken problemleri Design Thinking yaklaşımı ile ele alabilirsiniz. İki sürecin DNA’sı neredeyse aynı kodlara sahip…2. Öğrenme Deneyimi TasarımıGeleneksel program merkezli gelişim yaklaşımları yerini öğrenen merkezli yaklaşımlara bırakıyor. Öğrenenin gerçek ihtiyacını anlayarak, sıkıntı yaşadığı noktaları tespit etmekte empati kurma becerilerimizin yüksek olması gerekiyor. Sonrasında ise doğru öğrenme deneyimini sunarak yetkinlik geliştirmek mümkün.3. Endüstriyel Ürün TasarımıBaşlı başına #empati , fikir geliştirme ve #prototip leme süreçleri ile dolu bir yolculuk! İşin #müşteri, #üretim, #pazarlama ve daha birçok aşamasında, yüksek belirsizlik koşullarında problem çözme becerilerinin belirleyici olduğu bir süreç için Design Thinking, ekipteki tasarımcı olmayan üyelerin de bu şekilde düşünmeleri için doğru yöntemi sunacaktır.4. Çalışan Deneyimi Tasarımıİşin odağında insan olduğu sürece Design Thinking doğru çözümlere ulaşmada anahtar rol oynayacaktır. Doğru işgücünün organizasyonlara kazandırılmasından; mutlu bir çalışma ortamına kadar her alanda #ÇalışanDeneyimi tasarımı önem kazanıyor. Sürdürülebilir bir #İK yapısı için tüm İK çalışanlarının süreçlerini birer tasarımcı gibi ele alarak sürekli iyileştirmeleri bir zorunluluk haline geldi.5. İş Modeli TasarımıGünümüz girişimciler çağında gerek kendi başına bir #startup olsun, gerek bir organizasyonun çatısı altındaki iç girişim ekipleri olsun, doğru iş modelini bulmak için her gün onlarca problem çözmek zorunda kalırlar. Bu yüksek belirsizlik koşullarında sürdürülebilir bir iş modeli bulmak için Design Thinking yaklaşımları tüm dünyada aktif olarak kullanılıyor.Farklı tasarım süreçlerinden bahsetmek tabi ki mümkün! Ben en çok sorulan ve merak edilen alanları sıralamaya çalıştım. Sizlerin de katkılarınızı bekliyorum 👇🏼#LeanStartup #LeanStartupTurkey Lotus4Design #Design #CreativeThinking #Creativity #Entrepreneurship #business

Customer complaints are just another name for pain points. It's their way of telling you that your organization did not meet their needs as expected. Sometimes they do it in a pleasant and articulate way. Other times, customers are incoherent or rude. But don’t let that stop you. It’s your job to overlook the tone and the vocabulary and focus on the pain point. Click here to learn more http://ow.ly/lC8A50L8Jy0 #Differentiation #PainPoint #Complaints

Before I reached this point to where I am right now, I'm just like you who made mistakes (and will still make mistakes in the future) when I was starting my business.I was a Business Graduate and had my Master's Degree in Organizational Leadership and yet I went through a lot—a roller coaster ride of what business actually looks like.Here are the top 4 mistakes I made when starting:1. Not being decisive-I was afraid of making a wrong decision.2. Spending too much time on things that didn’t matter- want to know what matters when starting a business? It’s not the perfect website.3. Not being clear on who I served-you can niche to an industry or problem. But I wasn’t even clear on who I served.4. Not believing in myself-my business shifted when I started believing in myself and how I could help business owners transform from mediocre to great CEOs.Starting a business is hard, but growing it is a lot harder. As Coco Channel quoted “Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable."Yes you can reach that success, but be humble enough to learn from your previous mistakes, future mistakes you are going to make, and advices from an Expert.Need a piece of advice from a Business Strategist?

Egress Software Technologies have announced the results of a report which reveals that 56% of IT leaders say that their non-technical staff are only ‘somewhat’ prepared, or ‘not at all’ prepared, for a security attack.The research results show that the top attacks or risks employees fall victim to are the result of human-activated risks, such as accidental data loss, malicious data exfiltration or falling victim to a phishing attack.Jack Chapman, VP of Threat Intelligence at Egress “Organizations must build up their defences against attackers, provide proper training programs and also take meaningful action to tackle risks that originate from within – beginning with their people.”#cybersecuritynews #securitynews #infosecurity #ciso #cybersec #securitysolutions #technology #technews #cyberdefense #cyberresilience #datasecurity #PainPoint #Phishing #BusinessEmailCompromise #EmployeeTraining

Weekend advice to CEOs.In my former place of work, I asked my boss his reasons for not attending the board meeting. He told me that the board did not request his presence. I ask why?🤔He told me the board do not realize the potential of HR professionals and how much they can contribute to the board.That brought about my becoming the human resource #businesspartner.I always wanted a seat at the board meeting.My Advice to CEOs.✔See your HR as a #partner, not #police. ✔HR should be a part of the team as they own the workplace and its output.✔See HR professionals as your partner and grow them as such.If HR does not attend board meetings or report directly to you, you cannot say your company cares about your talent.HR is more than a place to go for benefits or employee complaints.HR is the jack of all trades in the company.They are the leaders behind all things from hiring to developing and retention of employees.They do a lot of behind the scene work that goes into making sure culture, community and compensation are on point.HR diversity gives a lens many other employees don’t have.But the #painpoint is that many CEOs are not seen HR as a partner.HR professionals have valuable insight that CEOs could use to guide their companies.Create more opportunities to collaborate with the HR departments and #gainvalue.To HR Professional:Deliver results that enrich the organization’s value to #stakeholders .Leave the #traditionalHR activities--- Staffing and compensation but outcome.I remain your humble #humanresourcebusinesspartner @ Peace Mirabel.Your #business growth is my pride.#humanresource #businesspartner#gainvalue

Following a similar theme as last week when I talked solo on design, this week we're talking about solving a clients pain points.  How are they identified and solved....

Can you guess which bank it is from the colours in the design? Straight from my old repository, one of the initial designs for a bank applications. The idea was simple: "Understanding the user pain-points with from the existing application and addressing them".For this bank, the main concern was the visual design, lack of analytics and the unresponsive interface. I made an attempt to make it a little better, if not perfect. Looking forward to your opinions, thoughts, comments and criticism. #design #visualdesign #uidesign #uxui #ui #bankapplication #userinterface #painpoints #painpoint #applicationdesign #designthinking #designers #userinterfacedesigner

Window shop for sneakers and jackets, not employers!A side effect of the 90-day notice period in India is that it gives candidates time to receive an offer with a new company and then keep interviewing just in case there is another position out there they might like better. This "window shopping" draws out the hiring process and is a huge pain point.It is unfair to the employer and the other candidates vying for a position to take an interview when you already have an offer lined up. This problem won't go away until the 90-day notice policy changes, so smaller companies might have to think outside of the box to find a solution that makes hiring less of an expensive struggle.During interviews, should we ask candidates if they have received other offers?When someone accepts an offer, should we require a social media announcement that they are starting to work with us in the interest of accountability?The 90-Day Notice policy is unlikely to change anytime soon, so what can companies do to prevent window shopping?#windowshopping #painpoint #hiring #interview #offers #outsideofthebox #brainstorm #candidates #HR #recruiters #90daynoticeperiod

"Okay...Ok I'm frustrated." I blurted this out without thinking yesterday in a meeting with a new coworker. 😳 I braced myself, internally, for their response. Historically, I am a conflict-avoidant person. I believed that conflict in the #workplace needed to be avoided at all costs. Side Note: More and more I am convinced that our desire to avoid conflict in the workplace is crippling innovation and healthy #workplaceculture.  Back to the tense conversation…😬 “Ok I am frustrated and clearly so are you. Tell me what specifically is it that is frustrating you about this.”  We were discussing solutions to a process that would help us automate a #painpoint. I was pushing ahead just looking for the solution and felt like my coworker was trying to be a roadblock. I was wrong. My coworker was pumping the breaks and probably felt like I was not considering their very real and legitimate concerns.  After they expressed their concerns it allowed us to come to a solution that was better than either of us had hoped! We reflected together on how we wouldn't have arrived at that conclusion if we had passive-aggressively chosen not to talk about our frustrations. GO, TEAM!  If you avoid conflict at work you are crippling your #productivity, your ability to #innovate, and your #career. Time and time again studies have shown that a key component of building #innovativeecosystems is psychological safety. You can’t have psychological safety if you can't express your emotions, most especially the unpleasant ones.  #innovation #workculture #worklife #team #work

#Casestudyday week 2 Part 2Yesterday in my #casestudy analysis, due to the word limit I wasn't able to mention alot of strategies and this talks of thatSo as we all know that Lenskart.com is a pioneer in the #eyewear world but what are the strategies that makes it the bestSo the 1st thing is its zero error tolerance policy,Where if we compare it with local opticians whose lenses mostly have a margin of error, #lenskart makes sure that if one buys from it, its accuracy should be top notchWhich in my viewUltimately eliminates middle men, plus due to its massive production setups Combined with its other strategies including effective costing, 15 days buy back, 72hrs delivery model and 5000 plus design integrations, makes inn a 70%+ savings on cost which when quantified, becomes a huge business driving and sustaining integration for Lenskart.com itself,WhichGives Lenskart.com the freedom to sell products at lower cost and has helped it capture the market like no one didPlusIts product accuracy keeps its #return rate below 4% which is extra ordinary in an ecomm world, where a 15% rate is also treated as good It also came up with crazy ideas like buy 1 get 1 free, #plus to eliminate trial based challenges, it came up with their revolutionary #virtual try on feature, post which they spent a ton of money in making eye wear look cool with lifestyle marketingBut what made it strong is what I call the POS based SC mechanismThoughThere is no such word in the dictionary but what it means is that Every stage of the SC is a POS for #lenskart and to understand this lets take an exampleLets assume you have a bad vision, what would you do??FirstlyBook an optician appointment who would then check your sight and give you the figures Now that you have stepped out of your house, you think why not buy specs from the same opticianAs If not, then you have to come back or open the app, mention your numbers, place an order, then again wait for its delivery And This friction is what i believe reduces the chances of people going to websites and ultimately they end up buying from the opticianBut to solve thisLenskart.com made partnerships with brands like 6over6 Vision Tech, which enabled them to do home based eye checkupsSo ultimately now, #lenskart's own eyewear specialist visits a customer with of it's 100 bestsellers,This way using the #lensometer solution, the field executive runs inn low cost vision tests, eliminating the very reason to visit an optician&This is how every part is a #POSAndThrough variety, cost cutting, convivence and by eliminating adoption challenges, Lenskart.com secures itself effectively#Learnings:Everytime there is a tech revolution, you either have to change your product or its SC or sometimes bothIn this case the product was the same but the SC was revolutionized&Remember everytime you see an undesirable #painpoint being pushed by corporates, you are looking at a business opportunity

Avviare un'impresa è un traguardo importante per molti imprenditori, ma mantenerne una è la vera lotta. Ci sono molte sfide comuni che ogni azienda deve affrontare, siano esse grandi o piccole.Un recente sondaggio ha mostrato che il 91% dei nuovi business sopravvive al primo anno ma solo il 40% rimane in piedi dopo il quinto.Quindi, facciamo un elenco delle principali sfide per ogni imprenditore: Trovare Clienti: difficoltà nell'individuare la giusta nicchia Aumentare la consapevolezza del marchio: mancanza di strategia per costruire una brand identity efficace Lead Generation: uso inadeguato degli strumenti per attrarre potenziali clienti Assumere persone di talento: possono volerci mesi prima che alcuni imprenditori trovino candidati adatti, il che può impedire alle piccole imprese di crescere il più rapidamente possibile. Pianificazione finanziaria: trovare il capitale adeguato da investire Gestione del tempo: troppi compiti collaterali e la necessità di concentrarsi sul core businessTi riconosci in uno dei punti elencati? Starting a business is a significant achievement for many entrepreneurs, but maintaining one is the real struggle. There are many common challenges every business faces, whether they are large or small. A recent survey showed that 91% of new business survive the first year but only 40% will make it until the end of the fifth year.So, let’s make a list of the main challenges for every entrepreneur: Finding Customers: difficulties in identifying the right nicheIncreasing Brand Awareness: lack of strategy to build an effective brand identityLead Generation: inadequate use of tools to attract potential costumersHiring Talented People: it can take months for some business owners to find suitable candidates, which can prevent small businesses from growing as quickly as they could.Financial Planning: to find the financing needed to run and grow the operation can slow down the workflowTime Management: too many collateral tasks and the need to focus on the core businessAre you a business owner struggling with one of these? ✅  #painpoint #challenges #sfide #successo #businessowners #imprese #crescita #startingabusiness #virtualassistant #timemanagement #gestionedeltempo #financialplanning #brandawareness #leadgeneration #assistentevirtuale #servizidisegreteria #serviziit #entrepreneur #imprenditori #ugwebsolution #startup

Who else has gotten caught up in the social media frenzy?I'm sure you have heard of content marketing. Over the last several years, content marketing has become the equivalent of social media marketing, but that just isn't true.Yes, there is a time and place for social media marketing. However, there is more to content marketing than social media.Content marketing can include:🔹E-Books🔹Videos🔹Podcasts🔹Newsletters🔹Landing pages for challenges and freebies🔹Blogs🔹Case studies🔹Infographics🔹Magazines🔹Guest posting on someone else's blog🔹Guest on someone's podcastThere is a reason why you shouldn't only rely on social media for marketing.

Quale è uno degli aspetti più importanti nel marketing? Le paure. Si, proprio le paure o per dirla all’americana i “pain points”.  Cos’è un pain point? Beh, se lavori nel marketing ne avrei sentito parlare in tutte le salse.Se così non fosse, ecco a te una definizione spiccia: “I pain points sono problemi specifici che i tuoi futuri clienti vivono in relazione al tuo prodotto/servizio.”Problemi, insomma. Ostacoli. Grattacapi. Rotture di… vabbè, hai capito.Oggi parliamo di pain points: cosa sono, come sfruttarli e perché sono così importanti.Parleremo anche nello specifico di dove usare i pain points con alcuni esempi reali di chi ha fatto della ricerca dei “problemi da risolvere” una vera ricchezza.E dove ne possiamo parlare se non in un nuovo lindo e pulito articolo del blog?

⚠️ Ihr #PainPoint: #Produktentwicklung kundenspezifischer Aufträge für komplexe oder variantenreiche Produkte effizienter gestalten. Sie kennen bereits die Produktstruktur im #SAP Standard? Guter Ansatz, für Sie ist diese Story jedoch nicht zu Ende erzählt? Dann lohnt sich ein 🔎 Blick auf #SAP #PPG!  #SAP #PPG – Product and Process Governance – erweitert die Produktstruktur mittels virtueller Objekte zu einem digitalen Produktmodell. Über den gesamten #Produktlebenszyklus werden kontinuierlich Daten mit diesem Modell synchronisiert. Ganz im Sinne des #DigitalThread reicht die ⚙️ Verzahnung nicht nur vom #Engineering in die #Fertigung, sondern bis in #Sales, #Projektmanagement und #Service.   Das Ergebnis: Egal ob #MTO & #CTO für variantenreiche Produkte, #CTO+ im Maschinenbau oder #ETO im Anlagenbau – #SAP #PPG optimiert ihre Kundenauftragsprozesse durch #Integration und #Automatisierung. So werden etwa auf Basis des digitalen Produktmodells automatisch nachfolgende Logistikprozesse getriggert.  Ziel ist es alle kundenspezifischen Aufträge mit nur einem digitalen Produktmodell abzubilden.  Das reduziert Kosten in der #Produktentwicklung, erhöht die Flexibilität Ihrer Prozesse und führt in Summe zu mehr Effizienz.   Um das Bild rund zu machen, lässt sich #SAP #PPG ganz leicht in 🔸#SAP #EPD und 🔸#SAP #ECTR integrieren.   Das trifft den Nerv, aber jetzt bitte ins Detail gehen? Kein Problem, melden Sie sich bei mir 📩 und schon hilft #allforone bei der #SAP #PPG Implementierung    #maschinenbau #anlagenbau #variantenkonfiguration #variantconfiguration #sapvc #vc #plm #engineering #productlifecycle #integration #s4hana #digitalisierung #digital #digitaltransformation #endtoend #e2e Christian Kern Dominik Maier Benjamin Zorn Claudia Braun Richard Becker

💡 Last week, I discussed style guides and preferences and the processes I work through with clients as part of my role as Managing Editor at nDash. You can find that post here: https://lnkd.in/eTx87iRRThis topic, of course, raised some additional questions – including:😳 What if the brand DOESN’T have a #styleguide to share with #writers or #editors?This problem isn’t uncommon, and as another part of my role as Managing Editor for nDash, I pull that information together. Here’s some of the process I use to draft a basic style guide:➡️ Look at what’s already published on the brand’s siteThis is the easiest place to start, especially if they show you examples of things they’ve published in the past that they either really like or don’t like. (Caveat: If they don’t like any of their content – which happens sometimes – it’s a great opportunity for you to work with them to refine their process and solve that #painpoint.)❓When auditing their content, ask yourself these (and other) questions:📝 Do they use serial commas? 📝 How are the headings formatted? 📝 How many paragraphs do they have in each section before breaking it up with another heading?📝 Can you tell if they follow AP or Chicago style?➡️ Check how they’re handling internal linking, eternal linking, and CTAsSome brands don’t want any links aside from external links to third-party resources validating data, claims/quotes, and statistics. Then, they add one internal link in the CTA pointing to a form fill, product page, contact page, or something like that.❓When examining the brand’s #linkingstrategy, ask yourself these (and other) questions:📝 Do they keep their CTAs at the end of the content below its conclusion?📝 Are CTAs sprinkled throughout the content – like, at the end of the introductory paragraph, somewhere in the middle, or both?📝 Are they anchor-linking to third-party sources or adding them as citations at the end of the content? 📝 Do you see links to other blogs anchored to text, or do they link out to product pages, case studies, data sheets, or other assets?Okay, this post is getting a little (a lot?) long. We haven’t even gotten into voice, tone, and messaging! 💡 Now, over to you – I’d love to hear about your process when you start writing for a brand that doesn’t have a style guide.

Why do teams avoid #ProblemFraming? Here are the most common reasons:👉 💡 "We already know what the problem is." - in most cases, teams just want to eliminate the "symptom" or the obvious #painpoint and get to the solving the problem part.👉 😫 "It's uncomfortable" - understanding the root cause of a problem and spending a lot of time in an ambiguous space is unpleasant, and it requires discipline.👉 🤯 "It's hard work" - finding insights and perspectives that make us look at the same issue in a different light is exhausting and extremely difficult.So, why should we consider Problem Framing before a #DesignSprint?

I get my best ideas while walking ...And today, my mind just could not stop bubbling with the ideas during the walk.Why?Because, I was listening to Grow and Convert's video titled "Blog Content Strategy: What Content Should You Produce to Generate Leads?" during an hour long walk.It's gold!Here are some key takeaways:1. When you are just getting started with content marketing, choose keywords that show searcher's interest in buying your product/service. e.g. "Best e-commerce fulfilment service companies"2. If it's difficult to come in top results for the selected keyword on Google try to narrow it down with the unique differentiation you offer.e.g. "Best e-commerce fulfilment service for startups" or "low volume pick and pack service at affordable price"3. Share your disruption story - where most other companies fail and how your product/service uniquely solves that problem.e.g. "Most content marketing agencies fail to bring leads for their clients here is what we do differently ..... "4. Share case studies or customer success stories tied with the pain points you solve in a way that when your ideal customer is looking for product/service like yours on google - you can show your proven track record and win customers.5. Write well researched in-depth content.6. Don’t shy away from putting your best sales pitch out there in the content.You are bound to get leads from your content marketing efforts!#internalchatter #contentmarketing #contentstrategy #startups #google #seo #blogs P.S.

Pain Point, cosa sono? I pain point, come dice la parola stessa, sono i punti dolenti di qualsiasi cliente o #paziente. Si tratta di quei nervi scoperti che gli esperti di #marketing dovrebbero andare a toccare quando comunicano con il target di riferimento. In sanità ovviamente questo tema è molto delicato, da una parte perché si trattano argomenti delicati relativi alla #salute delle persone, dall'altra perché la Legge vieta qualsiasi forma di comunicazione troppo esplicita. Quindi come puoi comunicare al meglio con il tuo pubblico usando i #painpoint? Basati sull’empatia. Individua i punti dolenti del tuo paziente ideale e dimostragli che esiste una soluzione e che sei tu a potergliela concedere. Empatia e professionalità nella comunicazione sanitaria sono due punti fondamentali, siete d’accordo?Christian Sabry Parabolic - Full Speed Business

I really admire product designers and marketers.Look what they do to a simple toothbrush..!They find out painpoints of users, design an appropriate solution and then with right communication they inform their target audience.Several decades ago the USP was just rounded bristles and today the options are amazing. Including sharper bristles !And by doing so, they take everyone up the value chain and what could be sold for a paltry amount now fetches several times more. And the customer happily pays for it.It is all about finding the right painpoints and addressing it appropriately.If you are running a small or mid-size business, how are you creating value for your customers and yourself? If you are just following the herd then it is time to talk to me..! We could brainstorm and address that issue.

End to sending mails with no attachment.How many times, it happens that you forget to attach mail and then the recipient will send a mail asking for attachment.This is a pain point which is small but very much real.A good example of user experience offered by Gmail which asks you to check if you forgot the attachment (or not).These small UX fixes define the overall experience of a great product.#productmanagement #ui #ux #design #customer #painpoint

Cela reste un #painpoint qui explique pour partie l'insatisfaction des clients.

The IT industry is one of the most innovative in the corporate world. This helps to understand why so many individuals want to work in the sector. However, many of these persons do not have a natural aptitude for coding.If you are interested in technology but not in coding, you should look into any of these four abilities, which are just as valuable, challenging, and lucrative as any other tech ability.These abilities are not restricted to the four listed; they also include SEO Specialist, Data Analyst, Technical Writer, Information Architect, Mobile Designer, and a host of others.So, if you want to pursue a career in technology but don't know how to code, don't be discouraged. All you need to do is select a position that matches your interests, talents, and expertise. There is always a way if there is a will.If you can relate to this, please leave a comment, and share.#2022 #Mobileapp #Development #Developers #Product #Services #Productdesign #painpoint #wednesdayvibes #wednesdaywisdom #ideas #easierlife #customers #techstartup #developer #websites #techskils #Skills #Noocode #techbusiness #technology #Palmviewsolutions #Solutions #Global #Appsolutions #Technology #Innovation #Customers #Tech #Palmviewtech

FLOW is not about winning or losing. It’s about bringing your best talents to your challenges.In the second round my shoulder dislocated perhaps I should have stopped but in 1980’s we were taught to train through and smile. I am proud of myself because though under constant fire I was hitting back, landing some great kicks and using Ju-Jitsu throws on my opponent several times even before MMA was thought of.Going the distance and doing a further three rounds with arm and two good legs goes to show what resilience is and how it is ingrained in the subconscious through constant practise.#entrepreneur #flow #painpointcoach

Is this what getting old is?I woke up today and my ring finger on one hand feels like it got jammed by a basketball.It’s not really swollen.It doesn’t have bruising.Yet I can’t curl it like I can my other hand and it is throbbing at the knuckle.I can’t remember doing anything to it and it doesn’t look like anything is wrong…Without a doubt, today, this is my pain point.I was thinking about sales and how sometimes the pain point of our customers are hard to find.The only way to truly know is to ask because you could never figure it out from looking in from the outside.But to get an honest answer takes trust and rapport.Which just might mean sharing a little about yourself first.Like feeling old when your finger is randomly injured 😉Have a great day (hopefully better than mine) #sales #painpoint #old #wtfhappened

David Kolb, USA Learning Theorist said, "Learning is the transformation of experience." I believe this is what makes my workshops so unique in that the participants get to emotionally experience the lesson shifting the learning from the short term memory to the long term memory. As humans we are more likely to recall an emotional experience. By stressing the bodies mentally and physically they experienced how much more difficult it is to FOCUS and so they were focred to consider different strategies of coping until a brake out moment occurred.

What is your data telling you?We are firm believers in measuring marketing efforts to better understand audience needs, but it's not enough to merely document the number of clicks, impressions and reach. Seek to understand what caused the fluctuation in your numbers. An environmental shift or industry-wide pain point could factor in to how receptive your audience is to your message.Want to learn more about #sociallistening practices?

Every sales process should have time set aside early in the process for understanding.Where you are curious, where you wonder.Where you question your buyer to find out what the problem or pain point is they have come to you to discuss and potentially solve.Where you articulate back to the buyer what your understanding of the problem is.Where you stand, just for a moment, in the buyers shoes.#understanding #salesprocess #curious #wonder #painpoint #findouttheproblem #potentiallysolve #articulate #understandtheproblem #standinthebuyersshoes #salesperson #salesperformer #getstronginsales #salestalk #saleslife #salestips #salesprocess #salespitch #salesgrowth #salesmanagement #salesrole #salesexpert #salesstrategist #howtosell #salescardio #salestrategy #businessowner #salessuccess #saleseffectiveness #success

A perennial eCommerce payment #painpoint: Being billed by startups in USD ...Simply billing businesses from overseas (even in AUD) on our credit cards increases our costs by 3% - that's just the foreign transaction fee.If billing in USD (or any other foreign currency), we then have to pay the eye watering retail FX spreads banks build into their exchange rate.Margins are already thin in eCommerce and this dilutes any savings the startup professes to deliverFor major expenses like shipping / 3PL - this adds up - grows as we scale - and will ultimately become the catalyst for switching providers...So, if your startup is all about helping small businesses in Australia succeed in eCommerce, consider setting up your ops to support local billing, in local currency.Businesses in other countries will no doubt appreciate the gesture too.Shout out if anyone knows a shipping aggregators that bill locally (and ideally integrate with Aussie Post and Wix). Home grown startups in the space, sadly, no longer do ... #payments #eCommerce

Dear Handshake, I was recently using your website to message a recruiter and was wondering if there is a way to expand the text box since it created a huge #painpoint for me. I tried zooming in and out and looked for possible ways to fix it, like changing browsers but it was not helping me. If this was not intentional, I would add a feature to expand the message box. #ux #uxdesign #webdesign #badux #badexperience

When I think about scalable Advanced Air Mobility I don't think of eVTOL uber-taxis or luxury personal transportation. I think of this.argodesign 's concept for a drone ambulance. Especially in urban environment, fast responders have difficulty navigating through traffic-jammed roads to access crash sites.According to argodesign an estimated 1,000 "saveable" lives are lost a year because of slow emergency response in the US biggest cities alone.It’s designed to land almost anywhere, thanks to a footprint the size of a compact car. The emergency responders stabilize the patient, load him/her up, and return back to the hospital for further treatment. “It would be nice to see them used this way, rather than another military function or more photography.” - said CEO Mark Rolston The idea was born from a team brainstorming session around how health care could become more accessible.The designers first thought about how they could build a better ambulance, and the rise of autonomous vehicles inspired them to consider a self-driving ambulance. Then they thought of helicopters and drones, and the rest developed from there.There’s also the issue of price: Rolston believes an ultralight drone could be constructed in the million dollar range.That's several times more expensive than a wheeled ambulance, but still cheaper than a medical helicopter.#DronesForGood #Concept #Drones #UAM #AAM #AirMobility #Uspace #DroneAmbulance #Technology #Innovation #PainPoint #Medevac

One annoying #painpoint experienced by clients is having their issues handed over or transferred from one representative to the next and having to start over each time to explain their issue. Mark Levy highlighted the need to 'OWN IT ALL THE WAY'. This is an excellent reminder as too many times, people #passthebuck and are quick to dust their hands of an 'issue' once it's deemed as handed over to another officer or department . It really comes across to the client that you're more interested in passing on their problem to the next person, than actually intervening and doing the needful to assist them in having their issue(s) resolved. This definitely constitutes #poorcustomerservice and will lead to #customerdissatisfaction. Persons within a #customerfocused organisation on the other hand, will seek to utilize #continuousimprovement strategies to always find ways to reduce #painpoints and instead create #momentsofmagic in an effort to build and maintain #brandloyalty and #brandadvocacy.

This is me and Norman Murphy taking our Brown Belts in Ju-Jitsu circa 1979.We were part of the Kirkby Ju-Jitsu Association that later became the Bushido Arts Council.Examiners Sensi John Hall 5th Dan & Sensi Tony Yung 2nd Dan. Attackers on the day Sensi Dave Ward 1st Dan & Jeff Bullock 1st Dan. Other attackers included Tony Barton.All the classes were very physical and Sensi Chris Longworth (Centre63-Kirkby), would have you train on the wooden floor if the mats were not out on time. I am grateful to all my instructors and particularly for this period as I think the hard work, commitment & dedication paved the way here for many of us and what was to come later with the Muay Thai/Kick Boxing.#jujitsu #painpointcoach #mindset #dedication

#RandomthoughtThe EARLIER you identify a symptom of a disease or an undesirable situation in your body, better are the chances of avoiding much damage to your body.Similarly, the earlier you identify and realise a pain point  in your customer journey or in your life , better are the chances of negotiating it which makes identifying pain and going after it and throwing it out of the sight a better option than identifying it after a considerable damage is done. So, keep an eye on what's giving you pain and what's keeping your business or life limited." Why ?/ Reason " is a great leader. Once you identify an undesirable situation, REASON will lead you better than anything.If knowledge leads to GLORY, Negligence leads to CHAOS. Needless to say , we know the consequences of neglecting a symptom or a pain point. #Painpoint #Customer #Challenge #Solution#Business #Startup #Technology #Company

If the pandemic has taught us one thing, it's that digital transformation is not really about technology, as we used to think in pre-covid times. It turns out, that we can all do technology very well. But great digital transformation starts with people. It is about designing a human-centered process by empathizing with actual human needs and tension points and applying it to the digital layers of human interaction. That's where the magic happens and technology sticks.#digitaltransformation #humancentereddesign #humancentreddesign #humancentered #humancenred #interactions #digitallayering #digitallayers #tensionpoints #painpoints #needs #humantension #tension #painpoint #painpoints #technology

When a company is trying to be better/faster/more appealing than the competition, they’re going to have to figure out barriers to purchase and how to eliminate those obstacles. Complaints can help. Sometimes they do it in a pleasant and articulate way. Other times, customers are incoherent or rude. But don’t let that stop you. It’s your job to overlook the tone and the vocabulary and focus on the pain point.    https://lnkd.in/gA423mn6 #CustomerComplaints #Differentiation #PainPoint

My two cents to my friend ...********After reading this post tell me a "Yay" or a "Nay" if I am a natural at #marketing *********One of my friends is resuming her career after 10 good years of maternity break.The other day while we were walking she told she is looking for someone in #compensationandbenefits who can guide her a little in acing the course she recently began.I personally don't know anyone in compensation and benefits, however, because I know she began the course to land a #job.Here are the two cents I gave to her:1. Create a strong LinkedIn profile, it's a great place to be found for a job2. Follow all people in #Singapore who are in #compensationandbenefits 3. Message a few to request #mentorship, having a mentor speeds up your growth like nothing else.4. Connect with Singapore based recruiters5. Tell them you would be ready soon for the job, ask them how you can make yourself a strong candidate for the job6. During your course keep sharing your learnings on LinkedIn7. Post regularly, use #opentowork along with other field related hashtagsI feel these tiny suggestions can surely help her #market #herself and land a job real quick!*********Now tell me ...1. Am I a natural at marketing?2. Do you know someone in #compensationandbenefits who will be ready to mentor my dear friend?3. Would you like to add anything to my two cents?#internalchatter#contentmarketingP.S. We help companies generate and convert more leads by bringing out their #internalchatter.

The great #resign, die Explosion an #EPUs und Micro Companies und die Bildung von leistungsstarken Netzwerken fachlich hervorragender Menschen - all das sind Faktoren eines Groundswells, der eines mit sich bringt: Fachkräfte die Experten Ihrer Domains sind, die aber wenig bis keine #Sales Erfahrung haben. Wie gewinne ich einen Kunden? Was schreibe ich in mein Angebot, wie verhandle ich das und wie gestalte ich den Prozeß bis dahin? Fragen über Fragen ...  Diesen #PainPoint kenne ich und er begegnet mir in meinem Umfeld tagtäglich. Daher war ich sofort von der Idee von Along überzeugt als mit Julian Philipp Nagel erstmals davon erzählt hat. Der Claim "align on anything, agree on everything" bringt es perfekt auf den Punkt - Along wird diesen Markt disruptieren: Sales und Business Development wird endlich #smooth. An dieser Stelle auch ein großes Dankeschön an Camilla Sievers die mich mit Julian connected hat und mir somit diese Opportunität eröffnet hat. #Netzwerk #Startups #angelinvestor

Marketing Pain Points. Regardless of what’s causing the pain, you now have a pain point you can counter in your marketing. Reference last week's post for the list of pain points we identified, and see how we could address them in market1ing:👌 Financial: Emphasize lower price point (if applicable), highlight the average savings of your client base, use language that reiterates better ROI.👌 Productivity: Highlight reductions in wasted time experienced by current customers, emphasize ease-of-use features (such as at-a-glance overviews or a centralized dashboard).👌 Processes: Mention current/planned integrations with existing products/services (i.e. Slack’s integration with Dropbox and Salesforce), highlight how your product/service can make typically difficult/time-intensive tasks easier.👌 Support: Help the prospect feel like a partner by highlighting your after-market support, using connecting language (“us,” “we” etc.) in your copy.Is your idea addressing a pain point? Hope you found this helpful? #2022 #Mobileapp #Development #Developers #Product #Services #Productdesign #painpoint #wednesdayvibes #wednesdaywisdom #ideas #easierlife #customers #techstartup #developer #websites #techbusiness #technology #Palmviewsolutions #Solutions #Global #Appsolutions #Technology #Innovation #Customers #Tech #Palmviewtech

Tres Puntos o Ellipsis (...)

Ese momento que no podes perder de vista. Ahí frente a todos se presento "mágicamente"  y al mejor estilo "Saquen una hoja" les dije, nos vamos al Mural.Improvisando Consigna les pregunte- ¿Cómo podríamos entre todos armar una linea de tiempo con esta ELLIPSIS, con estos tres puntos ( Pain Point/Weak Point/Relief Point?Este intercambio se desplegó en un itinerario cuyo recorrido se inicio en el Punto de Dolor (miedo,  vergüenza y preocupación por la mirada del otro, por el error) para ser transformado en el Punto Débil ( donde se encontró el origen, se tomo consciencia y se le dio identidad) para lograr finalmente alcanzar el Punto de Alivio, allí donde se esta construyendo y sucede el aprendizaje.  #painpoint #storytelling #weakpoint #reliefpoint #ellipsis #training #coaching #unaverdadincomoda #nancyduarteVN Consultora

Aujourd'hui j'aimerais partager avec vous une notion qui m'est très chère puisque qu'on va parler #qualité dans la #vente 🤵🏻Ce sujet n'est pas anodin puisqu'il est à la base de la #relationclient que vous construirez avec vos prospects et/ou clients 🤜🏼🤛🏼Saviez-vous qu'il existait 5 #freins bien distincts qui pouvaient faire échouer une vente? Et cela, tous secteurs confondus! 🏙Parmi eux nous avons le fait :- de ne pas avoir de réel #besoin. Par exemple, a-t-on réellement besoin de changer de téléphone tous les 2 ans alors que le notre fonctionne toujours?- de ne pas avoir le #budget adéquat. Avons-nous assez d'argent sur notre compte en banque pour nous acheter une nouvelle voiture?- de ne pas avoir d'#urgence dans notre achat. Est ce que cela peut attendre ou peut être reporté?- de ne pas avoir une réelle #envie d'acheter. C'est un bonus non nécessaire, je peux m'en passer!- de ne pas avoir de #confiance dans le produit et/ou le vendeur. Il me faut l'acheter mais j'ai des doutes sur l'honnêteté ou la qualité,...Mais seulement 2 d'entre eux sont réellement bloquants à une vente! 🙅🏻‍♂️D'après vous, lesquels?

#Doctors’ digital #dissatisfaction with #pharmacompanies has jumped during the #pandemic. Across media channels, dissatisfaction rates ranged from 23% to almost 50% of #physicians who were unhappy with #pharma #digital's #interactions, according to recent research by #pharma and #healthcare #consultancy Indegene. #Socialmedia is a particular #painpoint, with 49% of physicians not happy with those engagements. One of the problems there could be the #less #sophisticated #pharma engagement, especially when compared to expectations set by consumer companies.#Physicians expect the same level of #seamless experience and customer service as when shopping online on Amazon or streaming entertainment on services like Netflix, Gaurav Kapoor, Indegene executive VP, said.

Pain point: Devoir renvoyer des articles achetés en ligne 📦Vous achetez un pantalon en ligne. Facile. 😁
Il ne vous va pas. Vous devez le remballer, imprimer une etiquette et le réexpedier. Et vous n'avez même pas de pantalon. Pénible. 😠

Pourrions-nous imaginer un service d'essayage à domicile? 🤔

Vous commandez en ligne. Vous recevez vos pantalons. Vous avez 24h pour essayer dans le confort de votre chez vous. 🏠Puis, un livreur vient récuperer ce que vous ne gardez pas. 🚲
Tout ça gratuitement. Séduit(e)?

C'est un service rapide à mettre en place pour les boutiques des grandes villes. Grace à un pack de service logistique + SaaS de gestion des articles en essayage. 📊

Pour la boutique c'est augmenter son affluence et proposer un service différenciant. Pour la DNVB @Ayr Jeans: "75 % des acheteurs qui ont fini par faire un achat après avoir testé le jean chez eux sont des nouveaux clients"

L'essai à domicile existe chez Ace & Tate, Amazon Wardrobe et Stitch Fix par exemple. Mais le retour n'est jamais pris en charge.

Qu'en pensez-vous? Ce pain point existe-t-il ? Merite-t-il d'être abordé?

Le marché de l'essayage à domicile est une opportunité pour des acteurs comme Experienced Capital, Eurazeo, L Catterton, Lyra Ventures, Eutopia, Heartcore Capital , Alven Christelle Lécuyer-Weber François Meteyer Louis-Kentaro Danjou Claude Amielh Kenza Zayani Yacine Ghalim Alizée Natali Marion Combette #painpoint #market #businessmodel #business #solution #service #fashion #opportunité

Focus on getting Love from Clients not Likes from Fans.Social Media will have us believing the only way to be "successful" is to dominate every social platform and "build your following" on each.  As a result, we have grown folks trying to learn TikTok dances, inexperienced young "ceo's" giving "expert" business advice, and too many people trying to pretend to know everything about everything.But why? For social clout? The question we have to ask ourselves is...does this convert? I spent years doing what all the "experts" said I had to do, posting 10 million times a day on all platforms.  But when I stepped back and asked myself that simple question...my path to clients got clearer, the results came more frequently, and more importantly my TIME came back.Find what moves the needle forward for your career or company, and stick with that.  You don't need trends, or dances, you simply need to position yourself in front of clients who's pain point you can solve.#selfleadership #socialmedia #painpoint

L’empathie est d’une puissance remarquable Elle est une qualité essentielle qui est d’ailleurs à la base du #DesignThinkingJe voulais vous partager cette façon de penser car ça peut s’appliquer à votre business, vos projets, vos équipes et même votre vie personnelle. Lorsque nous rencontrons quelqu’un pour la première fois nous pouvons avoir beaucoup d’hypothèses sur sa personnalité. Mais en apprenant à la connaître, nous pouvons découvrir que nos suppositions n’étaient pas si exactes.Nous pouvons penser que nous savons qui est notre utilisateur, notre client mais la recherche en UX avec l’empathie révèle qui il est vraiment et ce dont il a réellement besoin, ça nous permet de créer un produit qui répond à un réel besoin… Je vous partagerai dans un autre post quelques techniques utilisées en #uxdesign #uxdesign #designthinking #uxresearch #empathy #empathie #rechercheutilisateur #painpoint #marketingdigital #digitalstrategy #uxstrategy #uxtraining #personas #customerjourney #customerjourneymapping

Why do teams avoid #ProblemFraming? Here are the most common reasons:👉 💡 "We already know what the problem is." - in most cases, teams just want to eliminate the "symptom" or the obvious #painpoint and get to the solving the problem part.👉 😫 "It's uncomfortable" - understanding the root cause of a problem and spending a lot of time in an ambiguous space is unpleasant, and it requires discipline.👉 🤯 "It's hard work" - finding insights and perspectives that make us look at the same issue in a different light is exhausting and extremely difficult.What would you add to the list?#problemdefinition #designthinking #innovation #research #strategy #strategicdesign #decisionmaking #decisionmakers#mindsetchange #talentdevelopment #alignment

FÜHRUNGSSCHMERZ erkennen, akzeptieren, auflösenOft werde ich von "meinen Frauen" gefragt, warum Führung häufig so sehr schmerzt - sowohl im Innern, als auch stark spürbar im Körper.Die Antworten sind komplex und hängen sehr davon ab, wie Du andere Menschen führst und Dich von ihnen "unbewusst" führen lässt, wer Du als Führungspersönlichkeit bist und vor allem wie Du Dich selbst führst.Führung bedeutet unter anderem🌟enorme Verantwortung🌟ein hoher Erwartungsdruck von außen🌟 innere Unruhe🌟 aktive, limitierende Glaubenssätze🌟 Unsicherheit🌟 ein hohes Maß an Fremdbestimmung🌟 wenig Freizeit🌟 wenig Work-Life-Harmonie🌟 schlechtes bis kein ZeitmanagementAll dem kannst Du mit einer gesunden und stabilen #Selbstführung entgehen und es Stück für Stück auflösen. Lean in, anstatt den Führungsschmerz wegwischen zu wollen. Akzeptiere ihn und handle vom sicheren Ort der Akzeptanz aus.Hell Yes - DU ENTSCHEIDEST, wie Du mit den Führungsherausforderungen umgehst.DU ALLEIN!Hell Yes - Ob Du's glauben magst oder nicht. Es ist so!Ich habe schon sehr viele Frauen raus aus dem Führungsschmerz begleitet.Jedes Mal sind sie erstaunt, positiv überrascht und extrem erleichtert, wie viel sie doch selbst in der Hand haben. Etwas Übung und schon wird Vieles leichter.Gib mir ein HELL YES in den Kommentaren, wenn auch Du an Deine Female Leaders Super-Woman-Kräfte glaubst!Bist Du schon Teil unserer #BEYONDLEADING Community? Nein? Gesell Dich zu uns und trag Dich für Dein wöchentliches Female Leaders Journal ein:https://lnkd.in/dP8f_Pj4 BIG NEWS: Mein Buch "Frauen geht in Führung! 90 Tage Führungsmuskeltraining" erscheint im März - zum Auflösen sämtlicher Führungsschmerzen.Hier kannst Du es schon jetzt vorbestellen:https://lnkd.in/d5ZCFWqN #femaleleaders #femaleempowerment #führungsverantwortung #führung #painpoint #führungsschmerz #erfolg #success #coaching #community #worklifebalance #zeitmanagement

I never want to speak to anyone ever again...🙅🙅🙅I'm that kind of customer. - manage my accounts online- opt for online live chat when needed- use all the apps they'll throw at me- resort to Twitter in an emergencyI'll do anything to avoid calling and waiting in one of those endless loops. But on occasion, you HAVE to call. Like this morning.I needed to call the bank about a transaction which somehow went through then got deleted. It was my mortgage so pretty important.Find the number (not always easy to find).Dial.That endless wait...I timed it at around 34 mins. (I've had worse experiences like the time I called Vodafone just after lockdown which literally ended with me in tears of frustration).Being thanked for my patience every 30 seconds just reminds me of how far my patience is wearing thin.The repetitive jingly music.Not a hint of what number I am in the queue.No offer to call me back.This is a customer #painpoint so big, ugly and obvious we don't really see it.The irony is when I finally get to speak with someone, it's a most pleasant experience, they sort the problem very quickly and I only feel warmth towards the bank which, only a couple of minutes earlier, I was about to switch away from.Why do they put us through this? Why do we put up with it?Who's gonna change this and put the customer first for a change?

Product-led customer success is a business strategy that applies product-led principles to customer success or CS functions.Product-led customer success teams put the product at the center of the customer experience and leverage product usage data to guide their strategy.They understand that customer happiness or retention is contingent on delivering exceptional experience across the entire user journey within the context of the product.CS represents the eyes, ears, and heart of a product-led organization with the goal of helping customers find their way to value. A product-led CS strategy requires organizational leaders, and customer success managers to bring a data-driven approach to this mission.They use product analytics to measure customer health, monitor user behaviors, and assess customer sentiment. Then they act on those insights with in-app messaging and guidance as needed. By bringing core CS functions like onboarding and enablement inside the product, CSMs can more easily engage with customers at scale without sacrificing customer service, freeing them to focus on high-value activities to foster deeper customer relationships.A product-led customer success strategy helps CS teams:- Reduce support ticket volumes- Improve long-term product and feature adoption - Predict at-risk accounts- Increase retention and long-term customer loyaltyWhen we look at product-led CS functions, we notice they have a few things in common. Product-led customer success teams:- Share a unified view of customers- Use qualitative and quantitative data- Leverage the product as a communication tool- Use segmentation to personalize their outreach- Support paying customers and freemium users- Shape the future of the productA key historic pain point for CS teams, particularly in large enterprises is that CSMs feel as if they don’t have a say in the product’s future. Product-led CS teams make it a priority to have a seat at the table, using data to understand customer engagement and amplifying customer feedback at scale. They also contribute to the product’s future direction by using the roadmap to have more strategic and informed discussions with their customers creating a continuous loop of feedback that drives product innovation and customer happiness.#plg #customersuccess #onboarding #enablement #painpoint #freemium

Developing a product begins with identifying a high-value customer pain point. After that, people or organizations are trying to do something, and they can’t. Or, if they can, it’s expensive or time-consuming or resource-intensive or inefficient or just unpleasant.Whether it’s moving a person or thing from Point A to Point B, finding the perfect gift, reaching the right audience, keeping people entertained, or some other objective, what’s currently available isn’t quite cutting it. People want something better or something they don’t have at all.Product management turns these abstract complaints, wants, and wishes into a problem statement looking for a solution. Solving that problem and easing that pain is the spark and motivation for everything that comes next. Without a clearly articulated goal that directly impacts that pain point, there’s not much hope that the product will gain any real traction or staying power.After assessing the the customer need your next thing is to quantify the opportunity. There are many problems and pain points out there, but not all are worth solving. This is when product managers swap their customer-centric hats for a business one.To justify investment in building a new product or solution, product management must answer the following questions and be able to build a business case based on the answers they find:What is the total addressable market?Is the problem or pain severe enough people will actually consider alternative solutions?Are they willing to pay for an alternative solution (or is there another way to monetize the solution)?Once product management has evaluated the potential market, they can then set about trying to address it if there’s a large enough opportunity. #productmanagement #business #people #power #motivation #investment #building #productmanager #painpoint

Pop quiz! What basic human item is missing in almost every hotel bathroom? Scroll for the big reveal!! …..  ….. Yup, it’s tampons. Travel is resuming. The odds of a person who menstruates needing a tampon (or other period supply) on a business trip is around 1 out of every 5 trips. If that’s not enough of a business case, imagine the following: - Your guest discovers they need a tampon and calls the front desk.- Guest (considers options, takes a moment, gathers courage, picks up the phone). “Hi there, I’d like some tampons sent to my room please.” - Front of house staff, “Can you please send some what?”- Guest repeats (starting to get embarrassed), “Some tampons. Please.”How does this conversation go from there? How might it go right? How might it go wrong? And why does this conversation even need to happen in the first place? At Throughline, we look for outlier experiences and pain points grounded in real human stories and experiences to fuel innovation in the healthcare ecosystem. We uncover the assumptions that may no longer (or never!) have been true and may be limiting opportunities to innovate. While the hotel industry is not our usual domain, the same rules apply. Products to support people who menstruate should be one of the ‘hotel bathroom basics’ alongside the shampoo, conditioner, hand cream, soap, robe, toilet paper, towels and the random lavender scent stick. Why aren’t they there in the first place? Uncertain - but it's never too late to change! #inclusivity #designthinking #innovation #painpoint #assumptions #periodequity #popquiz #westin #marriott #holidayinn #hospitality #hotels #businesstravel

🩺Extracting Oncology Insights From Real-world Clinical Data With NLP#Cancer is the leading cause of death and #disease  in the U.S., and  the numbers are staggering with nearly 2 million new cases of cancer expected to be #diagnosed in the U.S. this coming year. Cancer also represents a significant portion of total U.S. healthcare spending, estimated at more than $200B in 2020. As such, the #biopharmaceutical  industry is heavily focused on oncology drug development. Nearly 40 new cancer #drugs 💊were approved by the FDA in 2019 and 2020 alone, and more than 1300 new medications and #vaccines are in clinical development.🔆Measuring the efficacy of oncology interventions is critical to matching patients with the right intervention. #oncology data, and related #realworldevidence, have the potential to inform #clinicalresearch, trial design, regulatory decisions, safety assessments, treatment #pathways  and more.  Unfortunately, given the highly specialized nature of oncology care, disease criteria and endpoints typically are not available in #structured  formats and remain locked in data #silos, making them hard to #aggregate  and analyze.🔻In oncology, #pathology  reports (often captured in PDF format and siloed in #EMR systems), contain critical information, such as tumor size, #grade, #stage and #histology. These variables, once extracted with a natural language processing (NLP) system, can be used to define disease #cohorts, assess disease severity and create a baseline for disease #progression, which then can be applied to the aforementioned use cases, ranging from clinical trial matching to treatment pathways. But extracting this information from #unstructured clinical text data is often a huge #painpoint for data teams.💠John Snow Labs the leader in healthcare #NLP, and Databricks  are tackling these challenges head-on and working with many customers across the healthcare #ecosystem  to translate unstructured oncology data into actionable evidence.🔰The path forward begins with the Databricks #Lakehouse Platform, a modern data platform that combines the best elements of a data warehouse—such as data management and performance —with the low cost, flexibility and scale of a cloud data lake. This new, simplified architecture #enables health systems to unify all their data—structured (e.g. diagnoses and procedure codes found in #EHR databases), semi-structured (e.g. #HL7, #FHIR messages) and unstructured (e.g. free-text notes and images)— into a single, high-performance platform for both traditional analytics and data science.

After almost exactly #oneyear with my plug-in #hybrid car it’s time for a quick recap & some thoughts on #emobility:🔋 On average I have #charged almost every second day. From all driven kilometers around 20% have been #electric. 🔋 For me the plug-in hybrid technology is a good bridge towards full #emobility. If you charge regularly you can drive a significant amount of kilometers fully #electric & emission free, esp. within cities & city areas.🔋 #Battery capacity within plug-in hybrid cars is too small. In my car a full battery charge is worth about 30-35 km (12 kWh). Double capacity or less power consumption would improve usability significantly.🔋 Charging #infrastructure is a major #painpoint. I would charge significantly more often if possible but only very few stations are available and these are mostly blocked or occupied. If the amount of #electric cars increases further as expected, the #charging infrastructure needs to be expanded fast, esp. within urban areas. Today for me, without the possibility to #charge at home, a full #ev wouldn’t be doable. #emobility #evcharging #evcharginginfrastructure #pluginhybrid #mobility

Bring‘ immer einen Goodie mit!In meinen Coachings mit dem Team, hören sie einen Satz von mir so häufig wie keinen anderen: ^𝙎𝙚𝙞𝙙 𝙞𝙣𝙣𝙤𝙫𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙫 𝙪𝙣𝙙 𝙗𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙩 𝙞𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙧 𝙚𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙣 𝙂𝙤𝙤𝙙𝙞𝙚 𝙢𝙞𝙩^.❓ Warum machen wir diese #Vorleistung, wo doch alle Bücher und #Vorträge der Marketingstrategen sagen, dass man nichts tun sollte, was man nicht abrechnen kann?💡 Unser Anspruch ist es, Angebote zu machen, die nicht #vergleichbar sind.Wir haben uns also angewöhnt über mögliche #Goodies im Team zu sprechen und dediziert, je nach Art der Anfrage, Ideen mitzubringen, die einen wirklichen #painpoint treffen und somit direkten Mehrwert bietet.Ein paar Beispiele aus dem Bereich Design & Code (Firmenwebsite & Webshops):👉 Wir machen immer Webseiten-Audits (Loom Video) wo wir direkt Tipps geben und Quick Wins zeigen.👉 Wir zeigen konkrete Projektdemos im passenden Look & Feel.👉 Wir haben analysiert ob der Kunde SEO technisch gut aufgestellt ist und geben Verbesserungsvorschläge ❓ Kommt es oft vor, dass Anfragen nur die Quick Wins aus den Audits nehmen, diese selbst umsetzen und uns nie beauftragen?✌🏻 Das kommt sehr selten vor. Wir bevorzugen eine offene Zusammenarbeit auf Vertrauensbasis und Augenhöhe. Es stellt also sogar einen gewissen Filter für potenziellen Kunde*in da, die unsere Werte nicht teilen.Was für Goodies habt ihr in euren Angeboten?#businessdevelopment #offers #fromgoodtogreat

Let's go to a better place. Sometimes the way to that place is not clear. Pain Points and stresses come in many different ways but if it's keeping you up at night you are not going to think clear. Talking it through is effective but talking it over with an experienced person can  be like a lighthouse safely bringing your boat to shore.  #painpointcoach #experience

Actually *defining* a problem can be such a difficult task.And yet it is crucial to the design thinking process.If you can’t define the problem, then you won’t be able to design a solution.Think of the process being like a road trip.  You usually have an end destination in mind.However, the journey can go in all sorts of directions and take plenty of pit stops along the way.But in the end, you still want to get to your final destination.Same with design thinking.Creativity is never a linear process.  But that doesn’t mean we start without an end goal in mind.So before we do anything, we define the problem.And that means first identifying your user - who is experiencing this problem (or pain point)?Alright, so now you have your user.  What do they need to solve?  Think of using this sentence frame:  _____(User)_____ needs a way to _____(Verb)_____ because _____(Why is this a problem?)____.Phew! You did it!  (Psst! If you missed my earlier posts, check the comments for the link to catch up!)#BugProject #DesignThinking #ProblemSolving #ProblemFinding #DesignSprint #ProblemStatement #PainPoint #creativity #design

Do you know what upside down leadership is?It is taking the concept of leadership and flipping it on its head. In a lot of ways it is the concept of servant leadership.It is the idea that you aren't in it to elevate yourself. It takes pride out of the equation.As an upside down leader, you:1) Aren't in it for the power and authority leadership roles have attached to them2) care about creating greater influence so that you can invest in others.The role of a leader isn't to accumulate as much power as you can. It is to create more leaders who are engaged in the organization. It is a win for them, it is a win for you, and it is a win for the organization.Interested in turning your leadership upside-down?

The workforce has changed and will continue to change.  Organizations need to be flexible with the never-ending changes in the external environment (think about everything you can't change, that is the external environment). From new technology to new laws, to new expectations, the way that workers approach the workplace has changed.  They care less about the paycheck and more about how the job helps fulfill a purpose. They care less about an annual review and want an ongoing conversation about their job performance. They want to focus on what they do well and how it incorporates into the workplace. As a leader, when you can tap into this new generation and expectations for the new workforce, you will unlock higher productivity and potential than ever before.Source: @gallup.....#business #businessconsultant #businessdevelopment #businessmindset #coach #leadership #painpoint #improve #selfawareness #mindfulness #entrepreneurship #inspiration #continuallearning #reskilling #upskilling #development #professionaldevelopment #womeninbusiness #mentorship #possibilities #leadershipdevelopment #leadershipskills #leadershipcoach #leadershiptips

The second post in my How I use Fellow as CSM series is all about Tags! #️⃣Taking detailed notes during customer calls is crucial to helping me remember what was discussed, any tasks I’ll have to complete, and insights to share. But these notes can become long and take time to digest what needs immediate action and what needs to be done. To help save me time I use tags in Fellow to help me categorize my notes.Some of my most common tags I use in Fellow are:#featurerequest#insight#followup#submitted#customerlove#painpoint#submittedThese tags help me review my meeting notes afterwards and quickly give me direction on features I need to submit to our product team, customer insights to share in our Slack channels, and even what resources or information I told the customer I’d follow up on.One of my rituals is that every Friday I review all my #featurerequest tags from the week to make sure I have #submitted them. One of my best practices: once I have shared the #featurerequest or #insight internally, I add the #submitted tag so that I know it has been done. This helps me stay accountable to my customers!! 💪🏻How do you stay accountable with all things that come out of your customer calls? Share in the comments below! 👇🏻⏭ Next week I’ll be showcasing how I leverage our CRM integration so communication doesn’t remain siloed!

Tim Cook recently made a good point. We should do a better job of easing the concept of metaverse experiences to people outside the industry. In other words, it is a fundamental user problem to consider when designing Web3 projects, including AR, VR and everything in between.Other than that, it is up to people to decide how long they want to stay digitally immersed—precisely following the same behaviours we have with current devices. The truth is, we are already immersed; we just haven't stamped an industry buzzword for it.#metaverse #web3 #ux #painpoint #onboarding #immersive #spatialcomputing #marketingstrategy

Burnout in attorneys in the legal profession Complaints like boredom, work-life balance, and assignment of terrible cases are common among mid-level associates experiencing burnout at their workplaces. Despite the burnout, many employees choose to stay due to good pay. Today, more and more law companies are questioning the merits of a system that heavily encourages burnout, despair, and anxiety. Poor work-life balance, monotony, exhaustion, boredom, a lack of recognition, and a variety of other factors contribute to employee burnout. This paper discusses the measures companies can adopt to create a healthy work environment:  • Listening to employees • Recognizing pain points in the system • Hiring an attorney professional development expert Read the full paper here -> https://lnkd.in/dgmrEc3G or visit https://lnkd.in/dZGBtV6y to know more. #burnout #worklifebalance #employeewellbeing #painpoint #lawfirms #GreenPointLawandCompliance #eDiscovery #lawfirms #documentreview

Do you find it difficult to get #reviews for your business?Two years ago, when I was looking for a daycare for my child, I searched Google to find preschools near me.Went through reviews, ratings, and recommendations to shortlist a couple of daycares.Personally visited to select one.If you see, reviews play an important role. Reviews helped me narrow down from eight to three.Recently, when I was asked to write a review for the school, I was quite happy to do so.Here is what I really loved about the request email:1. Subject line - requesting appreciation2. Excellent timing - #Teachersday when parents/kids usually express gratitude in the form of cards or tiny gifts3. Email copy - Very well written - making receivers feel valued4. Email closing - expressing gratitude - driving a positive responseYour thoughts?#internalchatter#contentmarketingP.S.

Tüm tasarımlar doğru soruyu sormak ile başlar!Doğru soruyu tasarlamak; tasarımın kendini ortaya çıkarmak için atılması gereken en temel adımdır. Bunu gerektiği gibi tamamlayabilirseniz; bana göre kendinizi #tasarım sürecinin yarısını başarıyla tamamlamış kabul edebilirsiniz.#DesignThinking yaklaşımı özünde doğru soruları sormaya yarayan bir metottur. Derin bir empati ile #persona larınızı tanıyıp, en doğru acı noktayı ( #PainPoint ) tanımlamak ile ilerleyen bir süreçtir. Sonrasında ise, tanımladığınız problemi kullanıcılar üzerinde farklı prototipler ile test ederek gerekli öğrenme çıktılarını elde edersiniz…Tasarım süreci dendiğinde aklımıza onlarca şey gelse de ben Design Thinking yaklaşımı ile ele alınabilecek farklı tasarım türlerinden bahsetmek istiyorum.1. Kullanıcı Deneyimi Tasarımı ( #UXDesign )Ürün ya da servislerinizi geliştirirken kullanıcı beklentilerini, davranışlarını ve ürününüz ile kurdukları etkileşimi doğru anlamak; #sürdürülebilirlik açısından oldukça önemlidir. Süreçlerin farklı boyutlarında çözmeniz gereken problemleri Design Thinking yaklaşımı ile ele alabilirsiniz. İki sürecin DNA’sı neredeyse aynı kodlara sahip…2. Öğrenme Deneyimi TasarımıGeleneksel program merkezli gelişim yaklaşımları yerini öğrenen merkezli yaklaşımlara bırakıyor. Öğrenenin gerçek ihtiyacını anlayarak, sıkıntı yaşadığı noktaları tespit etmekte empati kurma becerilerimizin yüksek olması gerekiyor. Sonrasında ise doğru öğrenme deneyimini sunarak yetkinlik geliştirmek mümkün.3. Endüstriyel Ürün TasarımıBaşlı başına #empati , fikir geliştirme ve #prototip leme süreçleri ile dolu bir yolculuk! İşin #müşteri, #üretim, #pazarlama ve daha birçok aşamasında, yüksek belirsizlik koşullarında problem çözme becerilerinin belirleyici olduğu bir süreç için Design Thinking, ekipteki tasarımcı olmayan üyelerin de bu şekilde düşünmeleri için doğru yöntemi sunacaktır.4. Çalışan Deneyimi Tasarımıİşin odağında insan olduğu sürece Design Thinking doğru çözümlere ulaşmada anahtar rol oynayacaktır. Doğru işgücünün organizasyonlara kazandırılmasından; mutlu bir çalışma ortamına kadar her alanda #ÇalışanDeneyimi tasarımı önem kazanıyor. Sürdürülebilir bir #İK yapısı için tüm İK çalışanlarının süreçlerini birer tasarımcı gibi ele alarak sürekli iyileştirmeleri bir zorunluluk haline geldi.5. İş Modeli TasarımıGünümüz girişimciler çağında gerek kendi başına bir #startup olsun, gerek bir organizasyonun çatısı altındaki iç girişim ekipleri olsun, doğru iş modelini bulmak için her gün onlarca problem çözmek zorunda kalırlar. Bu yüksek belirsizlik koşullarında sürdürülebilir bir iş modeli bulmak için Design Thinking yaklaşımları tüm dünyada aktif olarak kullanılıyor.Farklı tasarım süreçlerinden bahsetmek tabi ki mümkün! Ben en çok sorulan ve merak edilen alanları sıralamaya çalıştım. Sizlerin de katkılarınızı bekliyorum 👇🏼#LeanStartup #LeanStartupTurkey #Design #CreativeThinking #Creativity #Entrepreneurship #businessadvice Cem Berk

PAIN POINTS OF AFFILIATE MARKETING As an affiliate marketer, you are always looking for ways to improve your campaigns and increase your earnings. However, there are some pain points that can make affiliate marketing challenging, including:1. Low conversion rates: If your conversion rates are low, it means that you are not generating as many sales as you could be. This can be frustrating and can make it difficult to scale your business.2. Tracking issues: Tracking your affiliate links can be tricky. If you don’t have a good system in place, it can be difficult to know which links are performing well and which ones are not. This can lead to wasted time and money.3. Rejection from networks: Getting rejected by affiliate networks can be discouraging. If you are constantly getting rejected, it can be difficult to find a network that is a good fit for your business.4. Payment issues: Getting paid on time can be a challenge for some affiliate marketers.But what are the solutions to this ...

One of the significant pitfalls for all entrepreneurs and executives is that they assume they know their potential customers and skip talking to them and gathering data. Recently, I was amazed to watch seasoned executives at CNN make this mistake. They spent $300 million to set up CNN+, but they did not do the necessary due diligence to gauge their viewers about the concept of CNN+, and their streamlining business failed. This well-known worldwide brand's new business could only attract about 10.000 viewers daily, and Chris Licht, the latest CNN CEO, nixed the venture after a month.#customerexperience #painpoint #solutions #brand #thewhy #customerfeedback

It's always interesting to ask different people in an organisation who their customer is - and what problem they're solving.Nine times out of ten you get different answers.Which of course just creates a load of frictions that stop you motoring.Get together as a team and answer a few questions:- What's your customer's emotional state today?- What triggers that state or pain?- What are the underlying causes?- What do they do to relieve the pain?- What would progress look like?Then compare notes:  How well are you aligned? Where are you not? Have a discussion and get aligned.If you're confused as an org, you're likely to be confusing your customer.#customerdiscovery #validation #targetcustomer #painpoints #painpoint #customerneeds #customerdevelopment Pen/paper is fine but you can also do this in Familiarize. https://lnkd.in/dxyvh5-F

Attended an interesting panel discussion yesterday on the rise and challenges of plant-based food ingredients for alternate protein segment at Hi-Fi #Expo, #BIEC, #Bangalore. #HiFi It has taken us 3+ years to understand this sector from macro level and first of all, why it should exist in India? Should it exist in India on the pretext of mainly being cruelty-free and sustainability? Should it exist in India on the pretext that 40%+ Indians (Rural & Urban) are protein deficient? Are the innovators and investors missing out a great opportunity today? Who will win - consumers, startups, farmers, MNCs, Angel investors, B2C, B2B, Ingredient supplier, Venture captalist, PE funds, government or maybe someone else? However, if you flip this question a bit…then ‘who will definitely not win’ in a longer run?Will the conventional protein companies just hold on to their existing beliefs and keep on ignoring this most-happening sunrise sector? Taking a corollary example, 70%+ people of West Bengal are lactose intolerant but maybe 99% of people there still drink milk 🥛. Is it so easy to just pour in money 💰 and consumers will their food habits or will the consumers suddenly wake up from their slumber one day and adopt unconventional proteins? Let’s get real…it’s not going to happen. From taste point of view, this is the right-time-right-place for consumers in India. They are going to be served with the best tasting alternative protein in few years time. And it may increase #consumerism.

Sachant que 1= .. et 10=..🔸 Ok tres clair et cette douleur concretement comment elle vous impacte au quotidien ? Qu’est ce qu’elle vous empêche de faire ou fait faire différemment ? 🔸 Ah vous ne pouvez pas courir ni faire de sport.Je comprends, pas évident - c’est important comment pour vous le sport ?🔸 Si vous n'en faites pas, comment ca va vous impacter personnellement, au quotidien ?Etc etc..🚨 On constate 3 niveaux d'impacts sur les points de douleur. 1️⃣ Impact technique- Qu’est ce qu’il se passe au niveau opérationnel ? (outils, temps, manipulation)2️⃣ Impact Business - Comment ca impacte votre organisation, vos chiffres, vos processus ? (chiffrez un maximum ici)3️⃣ Impact personnel - Quel est votre ressenti par rapport à ça, comment vous sentez-vous dans cette situation ?Après cela, tu auras mis le doigt ou ça fait mal et tu auras fait encore plus mal en creusant sur les différents niveaux.Tu peux désormais tranquillement pitcher les enjeux auxquels ta solution repond.A demain ✌️#painpoint #SDR #BDR #qualification

Les pain points positifs.Un des rôles de l’UX designer est de repérer, définir et gérer les points de friction (pain points) présents dans une expérience utilisateurs. Ces derniers consistent en des moments de frustration ressentis par l’utilisateur quand il interagit avec l’interface.Mais ces points de friction sont-ils toujours négatifs ou peuvent être bénéficiels pour l’utilisateur ?Les points de friction positifs interviennent quand le bénéfice d’une action est considéré comme ayant plus de poids que la frustration causée (ex. on rajoute une étape à une UX pour éviter une erreur de la part de l’utilisateur).L’Interaction Design Institut a écrit un article très intéressant sur le sujet dans lequel il décrit des exemples de points de friction positifs et les questions à se poser pour savoir si cela vaut le coût de les intégrer ou pas.Ici :https://lnkd.in/eqtdTteA#ux #ui #uxdesign #uxresearch #user #painpoint

"What is a good customer experience?"💡📌 How do you address #customer #painpoint? ➡️ Think outside the box and use it as an advantageLet's talk about IKEA 🪑Memes about the Swedish company went viral for the way they sell their products. If you've been to an Ikea store, you know that you need to take a day off from everything else. You need to invest at least half of your day in shopping in this "labyrinth store". On top of that, you still have to assemble the items you bought at home that come with a manual. (Yes, it's considered a manual)Here is the interesting part. Although it seems counterintuitive, Ikea embraced friction and tension from their #customerjourney. What makes it different is how they address customer pain points. For those who haven't been to any Ikea store, it might as well be considered a theme park for families and adults. The furniture is displayed as it would appear in your home and is particularly appealing to customers. In addition to their #smartdesigns, customers can also use the #mobile app. You can make lists, browse, and check the prices, and availability of your desired products. Moreover, they have a restaurant that serves delicious, but inexpensive meals where kids can also dine. #funfact : "Ikea Place App" uses #AR technology to help users visualize how the products would look in their homes. This decreases the risk of buying objects that don't fit your home.The store wants its customers to experience what most of us aspire to - a peaceful, quiet life, free of stress and anxiety. #cx #cxstrategy #retail #bestpractices #customerexperience

WHY GOOGLE ADS vs FACEBOOK ADS ARE MORE FAMOUS THAN BEYONCE!!!🤭👇Well, thanks for stopping by..😁.Obviously, this post is not about Beyonce. Recently, I have been having a doubt on advertising on which platform will give you best results, is it Google or Facebook ??And here's my answer to it  as far as my knowledge .👇👇👉 Google is a search platform and Facebook is a discovery platform. People come to Google in search of answers for their immediate pain and the similar ads ie search ads or display ads or shopping ads are shown and people get answers to it quick and that is why Google ads are expensive too. Whereas, Facebook is an entertainment platform and people come to Facebook for relaxation and not for immediate answers and so their pain is not so high. Even if you search for a keyword in facebook you are not shown relevant ads immediately, it takes time ie. if you have liked the similar keyword page or engaged with similar pages or shared some posts, and the more engagement you do , similar ads are shown which is why starting with Facebook ads are cheap. 😉👉 Google ads target the warmer audience, as their pain is high and faster is the conversion and Facebook ads target the colder audience and the conversion takes time at the beginning.😎So, this is my understanding about the two great  dad's... 😁Smash the comment box with more answers ....👇👇👇👇 #facebook #google #people #entertainment #engagement #targetting #adcampaign #cost #painpoint

What type of outreach is working best for you right now?I must hear this question 4 or 5 times a day, either in a discovery meeting or someone reaching out to me on LinkedIn. But, unfortunately, I can't give them an answer.What needs to be done next is a problem-centric discovery conversation. First, I have to understand the root cause of this question and what consequences they face from the problem.  At this point, the conversation can go two ways. They tell me what they are experiencing, or they want to hear from me what my SDRs are doing for outreach and not allow me to diagnose what's wrong.It doesn't matter which way they answer the question because it gives me an idea of how much pain they are in. This enables me to develop more qualified leads and forecast more accurately. How do you answer what outreach is working best for you?#develop #painpoint #forecasting

"Da piccole parole, derivano grandi responsabilità"Forse lo zio Ben di Spiderman non diceva così, però scommetto che se avesse studiato #copywriting, avrebbe rielaborato la sua frase cult in questo modo.E avrebbe avuto ragione, perché quelle piccole parole chiamate #microcopy hanno davvero un potere enorme.Quando si lavora su un'app il principale pain di un copywriter è quello di avere letteralmente poco spazio: tutto deve essere perfettamente fruibile dal piccolo schermo. Quelle grandi idee che sembrano geniali in una ventina di caratteri (che non sono molti) vanno spesso ridotte a poche manciate di parole. Ah... devono ovviamente continuare ad essere geniali.E quindi come si fa?  Un grande aiuto è quello di analizzare e comprendere a fondo ad un #painpoint.Non è un nuovo programma di Microsoft (anche se il nome lo suggerirebbe), ma sono i problemi che gli utenti hanno e che il prodotto/ servizio/ app per cui scriviamo si propone di risolvere.Conoscendo il pain point è possibile elaborare un microcopy efficace. Con questo infatti rispondiamo ad un problema dell'utente con poche parole rassicuranti, così come fosse un amico al telefono.Lavorando in quest'ottica diventa molto più facile elaborare microcopy efficienti.Per capire di più sui pain point e come gestirli con le parole nei diversi touchpoint con gli utenti, consiglio questo articolo di Pennamontata.

Un buen vendedor, debe estar preparado para vender en cualquier momento, las buenas oportunidades se presentan cuando menos te lo esperas, por eso un buen "Pitch de Ventas" debe ser considerado como una herramienta de alto valor. Saber que decir y conectar con tu prospecto, equivale a qué se abra la puerta o no. Para construir un "Pitch" efectivo requieres saber 3 hacks importantes:1. ¿Que solucionas?2. ¿Qué emoción genera en tu prospecto, el tener un problema, deseo o dolor?3. ¿Si tu prospecto no  lo resuelve, que pasaría?Recuerda que si no hay dolor, no hay venta.

Mobile insurance policies are good on paper only.You buy a phone costing upwards of Rs. 20000 ($280+) via Amazon.You get Acko (or other) mobile insurance product offered as cross sale.Since its a low cost add on (Rs. 500-1000), you tend to buy fearing the worst (screen damage, liquid spill etc.)You feel good that your phone is secured.Until it really happens.That's when you realize that insurance you purchased is a pain in itself.Your request to fix the phone will take anywhere between 7-20 days and that too after multiple calls.No guarantee that it will be fixed to your satisfaction.Majority of the cases, only 1 time repair is possible in a year.A big market opportunity for insurance providers to solve this post purchase user journey.I am sure companies like Ditto will be keeping an eye on this and emerge as a leader in this segment.#opportunity #amazon #leader #insurance #user #painpoint #productmanagement

Qualifying distracts from the real issue... What problem is your customer trying to solve? Could you actually solve that problem? Customer: "We must increase our efficiency." Customer: "There are too many clicks in X process." A vague pain point is not a real problem. These statements are being driven by real problems. A "too many clicks" issue is a symptom, not a root cause. Simple questions like, "Can you tell me more about that?" can help you uncover root causes. Finding and addressing the root cause of the problem is more likely to win deals than simply solving symptoms.#RevHeat #kenlundin #problemsolving #painpoint

When a company is trying to be better/faster/more appealing than the competition, they’re going to have to figure out barriers to purchase and how to eliminate those obstacles. Complaints can help. Sometimes they do it in a pleasant and articulate way. Other times, customers are incoherent or rude. But don’t let that stop you. It’s your job to overlook the tone and the vocabulary and focus on the pain point.    http://ow.ly/KIit50L8JG9 #CustomerComplaints #Differentiation #PainPoint

Day 28 - Pain Points 😑They are negative experiences a user faces in different aspects of the product. It can be on different levels : 1. Financial : Youtube premium ads, Spotify premium ads...... yeah those. Pain points related to money, the user experience getting hurdled by a payment screen.2. Product : Product pain points are issues with a product or service which consistently inconvenience users. A very famous example is push-pull doors, even the push/pull sign fails at times 😭.3. Process : These are pain points related to navigation, getting from point A to B in a product. Features that aren’t self explanatory can be confusing for the user on how to use, might as well get them to exit. 4. Support : Support pain points are from users feeling an bad support when using a product. An example of this kind of pain point is when a user is navigating a website or web service, runs into trouble, and is unable to locate a customer service contact point. This can affect the relationship of the user with the product.Done with 28 posts only, 92 days more to. We looked at more UX processes this week, we will be looking at UIs next week.

Exemple de techniques de #growthhacking simple : - louer des comptes ou créer des comptes sur des réseaux sociaux- ensuite on passe à l'action pour proposer son service dans un groupe actif ayant un gros #painpoint commun- en MP pour du cold ou en commentaire pour pousser sa solution- en parallèle un petit enrichissement des profils bien entendu pour les attaquer sur différents canaux (mail, tel et autres RS)--> un classique ! qui demande un peu de déontologie ou pas ^^' poke Pierrick Pretot /// Céline Souliers

What if your prospects and clients have no pain points and no problems?The vast majority of companies I know don’t have problems at all, and have achieved success. However, that is not to say that there is nothing that can’t be improved. The leader of every business I know without exception always has some aspect of the business he or she wants to change or improve, and is frequently looking for any help or advantage to do so more rapidly and with a greater likelihood of success.#painpoint #sales

Connais tu la "functional food"? 🏃‍♂️As-tu déjà dû prendre plus de Protéines, plus de Vitamine C, plus de Fer? 🥕

J'ai découvert ces boîtes de thon enrichi en Fer, Vitamine C, L-Carnitine etc... 
Elles s'adressent aux sportifs qui cherchent à accorder leur alimentation avec leur pratique sportive. 🚴‍♀️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏋️‍♀️

On trouve beaucoup ces produits outre-atlantique, surtout sur l'apport supplémentaire en protéines. Mais personne ou presque en Europe. 🇺🇸🇪🇺

On assiste à la création de marques lifestyle qui reproduisent même les shakers post-séance de musculation comme les skakes protéinés de Chobani, Drink Pirq ou FOGA. 

Vous avez déjà vu ça en France? Vous trouvez que l'offre est manquante? #food #offre #foodtech #painpoint #offer #business

TRUST YOUR GUT! - I'm a big believer in trusting your gut but I didn't quite realise what that might mean at Butternut Box... Or how much we should trust our pup's guts! Stinky farts and bad breath should not just be accepted as a dog's “normal”. This more often or not is an indication of something more.  You can check out our newest resident vet, Dr Bolu on this episode of Embarrassing Doggies! #butternutbox #Embarrassingdoggies #dogs #guthealth #trustyourgut #painpoint #wearehiring
