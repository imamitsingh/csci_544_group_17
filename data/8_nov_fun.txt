How to get #opportunities in your inbox without applying:🌟 SHOWCASE your KNOWLEDGE - You have certain knowledge 🧠  or experience ⏳️that most others don't. Yes, YOU.You don't have to be an expert, just share what you know. Share it and become an authoritative source of information in your field. Ex, 1. Got rejected in an #interview? Share what you learned. 2. Know a cool app that helps saves time? share it.3. Share your thoughts about a trending news and show how your expertise can help.🌟  CREATE a COMMUNITY - If you are looking for an opportunity within a company that's #hiring for your dream role, engage with their posts, find people who are currently in roles that match your interest, create a conversation and understand what they value. Create conservations, learn and share what you learned. People will follow once you consistently provide valuable content or engage with them.Have #fun meeting and learning from like minded people!For ex, if you are an #engineer contribute to the open source of the company you are targeting.🌟 Gain CREDIBILITY - Start a brand, create a Linkedin Page, create newsletters or courses. Seek out opportunities to speak, guest author articles in media etc.The more conversations you create, the more value you provide by sharing what you know, the bigger your network will become and faster you will build credibility among your community. 🌟 Attract OPPORTUNITIES - Once you gain credibility, opportunities you once wanted will soon come to your inbox. One such opportunity for me was the LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Program. I was provided an incredible opportunity by LinkedIn for Creators to share the knowledge and experience I've gained so far. They've provided me the tools and the support to spark conversations and share my knowledge.As a result:🌟 Recieved mutiple messages from recruiters for job opportunities which I never applied to. (I love my current role so I passed the opportunities over the others in the field)🌟 My following has increased 50%🌟 Recieved opportunities to speak 🌟 Recieved opportunities to serve on boards of non-profit orgs.🌟 Access to exclusive conferences such as the Forbes CIO Next Summit and networking opportunities with C-suite.⚠️Takeway⚠️1. Remember, we all started with 0 followers and 0 connections. Even MrBeast and the most followed LinkedIn member Bill Gates started with 0.2. You don't need fancy equipments or need to be an expert. You just need a phone or a laptop to get started on your knowledge sharing journey.Create your opportunities!#createonlinkedin #licreatoraccelerator #job #Twitter #peloton #zillow #docusign #layoff #Ford #Meta #office #litrendingtopics

#javascript #fun Some people says that JavaScript is a bad language but I always had fun with it: you can use it to create boring forms but also for web games, mobile apps, animations, 3D, interactive infographics and a lot of other interesting things.But I also wanted to use hardware and connect devices, sensors and more!!So, exactly one year ago I studied Python (and MicroPython / Circuit Python) for a couple of months and I have worked on several micro demo to mix JS and Python and try to understand new concepts that I didn't know:  how to configure a local MQTT server , have fun with Raspberry, Telegram Bots, Sensors, create simple security systems with webcams and other stuff.So one of the first demo I have created on my Twitch Channel was a tool that use Google Street API to navigate the world by using a Joystick.I think it's the most useless thing I've done in my life(... no I'm lying, I've done worse 🤣)How beautiful is it to be a developer? I love it ♥️Anyway, what is the most useless thing you have created writing code? Be honest :D

Life of a S.O.S : Slower, Older & Smarter.An Airbus 380 is on its way across the Atlantic. It flies consistently at 800 km/h at 30,000 feet, when suddenly a Eurofighter with a Tempo Mach 2 appears.The pilot of the fighter jet slows down, flies alongside the Airbus and greets the pilot of the passenger plane by radio:   "Airbus, boring flight isn’t it? Now have a look here!"He rolls his jet on its back, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, and then swoops down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. He loops back next to the Airbus and asks:   "Well, how was that?"The Airbus pilot answers: "Very impressive, but watch this!"The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly straight, at the same speed. After 15 minutes, the Airbus pilot radios, "Well, how was that?Confused, the jet pilot asks, "What did you do?"The AirBus pilot laughs and says:   "I got up, stretched my legs, walked to the back of the aircraft to use the washroom, then got a cup of coffee and a chocolate fudge pastry."The moral of the story is:  When you’re young, speed and adrenaline seems to be great. But as you get older and wiser, you learn that comfort and peace are more important.This is called S.O.S.: Slower, Older and Smarter.Dedicated to all my senior friends  ~  it’s time to slow down and enjoy the rest of the trip.  🤗❤Are you enjoying S.O.S life ?

Once upon a time I was 18 years old, and a nervous freshman at Albright College.During our freshman orientation a company called Playfair Inc. came in  and changed our lives through the concept of #NonCompetitive Play!I remember quickly running up after the program to buy their book, which I still have, because their mission was all about "games for people who are interested in learning about a new type of play that lets people be supportive, cooperative and open with each other."  To my shock and absolute joy, I found out last week that this company is still making a big impact on both college campuses and within organizations thanks to their Emperor (!) Matt Weinstein. I've added the link to their website in the comments. #employeeappreciation #fun #employeeengagement #campuslife

Part 2: Reflecting on my time at St Hilda's. Today I share with you a small collection of jobs where I found some fun in the brief.It's a Sign  //  Always Look for OpportunitiesThese were straightforward briefs that essentially boiled down to "We need a new one of these." But where's the fun in that? I incorporated the School's new strategic pillars to turn a loud looking 'quiet' sign, into a series of fun reminders to be quiet around exam time. I took the request for a larger swim school sign and made a vibrant entry statement instead. The point is, no matter how bland the brief might seem, even the smaller projects can provide an opportunity to do something interesting.

I finished watching The Greatest Beer Run Ever on Apple TV+. It's about John "Chickie" Donohue, who leaves New York to track down his army buddies in Vietnam and share a few beers with them.It started as a goofy bar comment, blossomed into a planned international trip, and then executed reasonably well with plenty of surprises along the way. In the end, "Chickie" delivered those beers to his friends on the front lines in Vietnam.The story reminded me of when I was sitting at Dodgers Stadium, thinking about my next baseball adventure. I decided I wanted to travel to Cuba and pitch for the local Cienfuegos team against an American squad I knew very well. My American baseball friends would be there the second week of February, so I planned the secret trip and, after weeks of back and forth, convinced the Cubans to allow me to play and be their starting pitcher.I arrived in Havana and had dinner on a patio where I could see the American team's bus. The following day, I traveled to Cienfuegos, arriving hours before the Americans, and hid in town for 1.5 days. The next morning, dressed in my Cienfuegos green uniform, I found a ride to the field, warmed up before the Americans arrived, and hid in the dugout. After the teams lined up along the foul line and the national anthems played, I took the mound, picked up the game ball, and heard from the American dugout, "Is that Aron Levinson on the mound?".I firmly believe that if you can dream it, you can achieve it, but only if you create a sound strategy, have the right people to execute the plan, and be okay with adjusting to hiccups along the journey.Play ball.#strategy #team #people #baseball #gameplan #fun

Most of us do not have 'fun' at work. And that's a problem.For many of us, work is simply exhausting. It's a daily chore that we dread and seems to sap all our energy. We wake up feeling tired, mourn the loss of another day, and drag ourselves through the motions ticking it out only because we have to. When we are unenthused about our work, it leads to poorer quality and less productivity. This can make us doubt our effectiveness as a professional. Work does not have to be synonymous with drudgery - in fact, we can make work a more pleasant experience if we put some effort into making it 'fun.' All of us have surely experienced that when we tell stories about having fun - the best times of our day or lives - we glow, we feel happy, and while telling those stories, we feel energized. By infusing some fun into our work lives, we can become happier and more motivated individuals. This will benefit us personally and positively impact the company we work for too.By fun, I do not mean constantly playing pranks or organizing happy hours - though those can be fun too. Fun at work can mean simply enjoying and finding fulfillment in our tasks, whether through implementing new and creative ideas, collaborating with colleagues, or engaging in activities that boost morale.So how can we make work fun?We need to prioritize three things - playfulness, human connection, and flow. Being playful means having fun, not taking things too seriously, and being open to new experiences. It's about being silly sometimes, enjoying a good laugh, and using your imagination. Human connection is about maintaining positive relationships with our colleagues, supervisors, and clients. This means practicing good communication skills, being compassionate and empathetic, creating a supportive work environment, and fostering a sense of community in the workplace.Flow refers to being fully immersed in an activity that brings us joy and challenges us at the same time. It's about finding tasks or projects that we are passionate about and truly enjoying the process of doing them. These three are not at all hard. But one of the main reasons we're not having enough fun is that we're not prioritizing it. We must make it a priority. That doesn't mean that you need to mark a 20 minutes slot for 'having fun' in your day but to be aware of your surroundings and open to possibilities. Having fun is important not just for our mental well-being, but some studies have shown that it is also important for our physical well-being.I bet that making work fun is really fun! Try these three things out and see how they can improve your work experience. Who knows, you might actually start looking forward to Monday mornings! 😉 #work #fun

Life is so full of struggle, uncertainty, danger, and sadness at the moment for so many, so collectively  let's take a little pause each day to find those positives in our lives and ripple them out with kindness to all of us who need it around the world right now.💛I absolutely love all the positives you share with me and each other, relationships are blossoming and positives are growing and being celebrated.💛I will continue to post at 6.30 pm.

A group of scientists from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden have been sneaking Bob Dylan quotes into research papers as part of a long-running bet. Two stars of the soap opera The Young and the Restless (playing the characters of Nick and Phyllis) had a running bet as to who could seamlessly weave a certain word of the day into their lines. Someone else told me how they'd select a word of the day randomly from a dictionary and then all the front line retail staff where they worked were challenged to weave it into conversations with customers. So, why not adapt these ideas for your workplace - challenge everyone to weave a word or phrase into business presentations, e-mails, reports, meetings, or everyday conversation with colleagues? It could be a daily or weekly challenge, a one-off at a meeting, or a word or phrase of the month.  #funatwork #fun #humoratwork #funworktips

It's officially the end of ⚡️ Week 10 ⚡️ of my UX/UI Design bootcamp with Memorisely!  🪜 It's been a while since I've posted about my journey with Memorisely, but it's been great. Every day I'm learning from the best (Lilibeth Bustos Linares) and collaborating with teammates who challenge and inspire me to be a better thinker, researcher, writer, and designer.• • • • • • 🥁 On October 17, I started working on a new case study of the Sofar Sounds website with Haley Smith and Kristin McKinney!! 👩🏻‍💻 We started our case study with a usability audit and competitor benchmarking. Then, we conducted 9 interviews with avid concert-goers and music-lovers to gain insight into their typical behaviors and expectations when searching for concerts online.🗺 This week, we conducted qualitative response analysis using Dovetail, and have been creating affinity maps (pictured below) to effectively organize our insights in FigJam!! Without a doubt, this was the most #fun I've ever had while analyzing research.⏭ Next week, we start wireframing and prototyping in Figma!• • • • • •💬 Related update: a polished prototype and full write-up of my first case study with Sujin Kim are on the way! We presented our work on November 2 and are currently making improvements based on the feedback we received.#ux #ui #uxdesign #design #userresearch #data #qualitative #research #qualitativeresearch #music #figmacommunity #figjam #learningeveryday

Awesome day, always! 😉☀️☕️🥣🤗👍☕️🦍💪🏽 7/60 day of my challenge called #project60 which for me started 60 days before the new year!——————Great day at work plus a day with climbing, just perfect! 🦍 I am also very happy with including Push-Ups and Sit-Ups into my workout, for opposite strength movements and even more core strength training. 💪🏽 One of my goals is also to spend at least 30 minutes in the sun every day, which I also managed to do, today. ☀️ Overall, to be able to incorporate new activities in your day you should look at all the things that you really don’t necessarily have to do… ⏳——————My challenge started when I made the decision to start and you can start too! Start any day before the new year and basically call it #projectd2ny as in “project days to new you or new year”. Join me and let’s celebrate the little successes and failures along the way, together.#getup #morning #routine #tea #breakfast #family #work #climbing #yoga #chess #health #nutrition #sun #longevity #projects #fun #friends #celebration #sucess #fail #learn #connect #newskills #discipline #selfimprovement #efficiency #effectiveness #newyear #newyou #newhabits #headstart #projectd2ny

It’s real, and it is an #iPhone but not what you think.You won’t be seeing an iPhone #foldable for a while based on the latest rumors.  Apple has opted to go with a 20” iPad as their first attempt at this emerging market.The worlds first iPhone Fold fabricated by a hacker with a bunch of donor #Motorola Razors and iPhones to yield the resulting foldable monster that actually works.Amazing how standards work huh?  #smartphone screen sizes have standards too.  Plus they only source from a handful of vendors, especially premium ones.A great learning video for some.  A marvel accomplishment to be watched by many.What I am most interest in is the connector from the mainboard to the display.

𝙅𝙚 𝙠𝙪𝙣𝙩 𝙜𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙣𝙚𝙚 𝙯𝙚𝙜𝙜𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙚𝙜𝙚𝙣 𝙞𝙚𝙩𝙨 𝙬𝙖𝙩 𝙟𝙚 𝙣𝙞𝙚𝙩 𝙠𝙚𝙣𝙩En toch heb ik dat gedaan! Al heel wat jaren terug en later zei ik alsnog JA.In mijn leven ben ik de voeding van Herbalife Nutrition al vaker tegen gekomen. Alleen was ik er toen niet aan toe, had ik geen doel om aan te werken of was het gewoon niet het moment.Mijn vooroordeel speelde mij ook parten, dat geef ik eerlijk toe. Ik had een mening over de producten, die gebaseerd was op verhalen van anderen. Totdat ik in 2012 vastliep in mijn energie. En hoewel ik niet geloofde dat deze voeding voor mij het verschil zou maken, was ik zo wanhopig dat ik de proef op de som besloot te nemen.Met de intentie om te bewijzen dat het niet werkte, hoe eigenwijs en sceptisch kun je zijn!!Al binnen 10 dagen merkte ik verbetering en nog wilde ik niet geloven dat de voeding daaraan bijdroeg. Inmiddels weet ik beter. Energie van -30 naar +300 en al jaren stabiel!En ik dat ik nu anderen mag helpen om ook meer energie te krijgen, daar krijg zelf ook nog weer een energieboost van!!Op een schaal van 1-10, hoe is het met jouw energielevel?#vitaliteit #energie #fit #fitter #fitworden #fitzijn #fitblijven #energiek #batterij #moe #dip #altijdmoe #nietfit #nietlekkerinjevel #lekkerinjevel #energy #topfit #lekker #boost #vitality #immuunsysteem #burnout #boreout #fun #samen #fitcoach #tips #tricks

When I first started coaching I used to ask other coaches how many sessions they would do per day. The most common answer that I would get was four because any more would leave them feeling exhausted.   For me, I’ve always found coaching gives me energy!  I guess it’s true that when you’re passionate about your work, it doesn’t feel like work at all!

Transitioning from #fixedmindset (Avoid & Threatened) to #growthmindset (Embrace & Inspirational)Many people are trapped in a vortex of #rigid and #fixedmindset, mostly on an #unconscious basis. Intellectually, they might know exactly what to do, but #mentally and #emotionally, they might be totally clueless and unprepared!!Since everyone’s #desires and #motivations are different to begin with, #management has the big task of aligning everyone towards the same #objective and #direction.We are by nature, creatures of #habits, #patterns and #programs. We faithfully follow because we feel comfortable, safe and secure when using them. This partially explains the #difficulties we face in effecting #change.The program will primarily focus on the specific area of identifying, modifying, leveraging and reinforcing the #mindsets of individuals. It is envisaged that this will be the first step towards #transitioning from a #fixedmindset to a #growthmindset. Program is conducted based on primarily an #experientiallearning approach to highlight the #unconscious but prevailing nature of our #mindsets. The emphasis will be on #learning through the use of specially selected activities, further augmented by targeted debriefing. It will be fully supported and supplemented by discussions and reflections to drive-home the main learning points. There will NOT be long #boring #lectures; instead, the session can be as #fun and #educational as the participants allow it to be.To enquire, DM or write us an email (wendy@nashbs.com or jane@nashbs.com) to enquire on this specially curated program which has been applauded and well received by many of our clients. Most effective for in-house or incorporated as part of a teambuilding event to achieve the best results.

I love vision boards! As I get more creative on Canva more and more I am a big fan of digital vision boards to accompany my writing. They help me tune into the emotion and vibration of what goals and dreams I want to move towards. They capture my essence visually, my branding, they are easy to make, change, and reference.Super easy to check in and reflect on progress throughout the journey.It’s not even halfway through November and so much has been achieved already.I was so close to quitting but when I look at my vision board I can quickly see progress and know I’m moving in the direction I dreamed of, supported by many special people How do you like to do your visualisation?#visionboard #visioning #visualisation #manifestation #manifest #frequency #vibrationalenergy #success #progress #visual #creative #fun #lawofattraction #digitalcreator #lunadilimonerosso #spiritualcoach #spirituallifecoach #intuitivehealer #mediumship #pyschic #energyhealing #tarotreader #oraclereader #reikihealer🔮✨  #digital #branding #writing

Here we are gathered in one of the last moments of the autumn course organized by BEST Rome. What characterizes this event is the meeting of cultures and traditions; especially the one of this year was focused on the dear theme of microplastics. Thanks to these circumstances the BEST spirit shown itself in its brightside: a community that learns while having fun and creating bonds between students. There were many refreshing moments that allowed the participants to make new friends, and on the other side acquiring knowledge. Our goal was to involve all participants on an emotional level by leaving a mark in their lives, making people appreciate the opportunities and experiences that a course like this can give. See u in the next one =). #bestcourse #autumn #2022 #bestorg #bestspirit #learning #friendship #fun #flexibility #improvement #microplastics #environment #pollution #green #experience #rome #travelNovember 08, 2022 at 06:10PMvia Instagram https://lnkd.in/dD7W_SJF
