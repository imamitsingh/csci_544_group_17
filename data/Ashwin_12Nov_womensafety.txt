Greetings, connections!!I am elated to share that this September 2022, me and my teammates Shreya Agrawal and Sai Harsha Varma Sangaraju participated in Autumn hacks organized by Major League Hacking. I am delighted to share that we won third prize overall in that hackathon.We created an app for Women's safety and welfare which encompasses all the safety features that a woman will ever need in any dangerous and vulnerable situation.# No Human Should Be Without Rights.Link of the project- https://lnkd.in/gch5t9JA Some of the real-time uses include: Feature 1: SOS 🆘  whereupon an emergency sends the live location to police and trusted contacts. Feature 2: We will educate youth on Women's Health, Self defense, and knowing which activities will get them into danger. Feature 3: Our application will show them the shortest and safest route based on previous crime rates and warn them of probable danger.Feature 4: We will list all the Women's helpline numbers, Government Schemes & laws for women.Feature 5: News feedWe also got an opportunity for an interview from Hearts of Love. That was a great experience and we learned a lot in this hackathon.#hacking #experience #womensafety #hackathon #mlh #winning #project #connections #interview

“Canada calls it a genocide. The United States considers it an epidemic. But here in Australia, we’re only just waking up to the scale of the crisis.” A recent Four Corners program highlighted the lack of agency in Australia charged with keeping count of how many First Nations women are going missing, have been murdered or killed in suspicious circumstances. Which poses the question - how can violence be prevented if we don’t even know the extent of the issue?#womensafety #familyviolence #genderbasedviolence #firstnationspeople #violenceagainstwomen #violenceprevention

Infrastructure is vital in society for implementing faster economic growth and reducing poverty in the country. Both genders have different needs in terms of public interest, depending on their social roles, economic status, or preferences. According to studies, men overwhelmingly dominate infrastructure decision-making, even when the projects are aimed at female end-users.Saksham Jha's study brings the spotlight on women's perspectives in urban spaces and articulates how there is still a constraint in the mobility of women in Delhi subways. This also raises questions about why gender-inclusive infrastructure planning and rigorous monitoring are required when implementing public spaces throughout the country.Download the application to read the complete case study.

Do you Know....The Conciliation...?There is a provision in the POSH Act that opens the gates of settlement between the parties. This is called Conciliation. However, there are some norms to it. 1. It is the responsibility of Internal Committee to suggest the option of Conciliation to the complainant in the first interaction. 2. Conciliation is to be done before the investigation starts.3. This option can be opted only on the request of the complainant. 4. No monetary settlement allowed in this process. 5. No further inquiry is to be done if the complainant opted for conciliation. Now, my question is...as to why has Law kept the option of 'Conciliation' at all?What is your say on it?#Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee  #externalmember #mwcd #law #traininganddevelopment #leaders #linkedin #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment#equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh  #work #gender #india

This app is designed keeping in mind all the possible risks women might encounter and the solutions to these risks. Please check it out and let me know if I made any mistakes, or what could be improved. Happy reading! 🙂 #casestudy #uiuxdesign #problemsolving #womensafety

An AppealSometimes, either of the parties, the complainant or the respondant is not satisfied with the recommendations presented by the Internal Committee. Section 18 of the POSH Act 2013 comes to rescue in this scenario. Wherein, either of the parties have the right to appeal in the appropriate court to review the recommendation of the IC. Please be noted, the appeal is there to recheck if there is any factual or legal error in the proceedings of the case that produced the concerned outcome. Appeal does not allow re-opening of the case. It is also not about introducing new evidances, wittnesses or re-argue the facts.As per the time frame specified in the law, the appeal must be filed within 90 days of the recommendation of the ICC.

May her soul Rest in PeaceElaben Bhatt, the ‘gentle revolutionary’ who pioneered the movement to empower women in India and won global acclaim, died here on Wednesday. She founded Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), one of the biggest women-led cooperatives and national trade unions with 2.1 million-strong membership across 18 states.Bhatt’s influence inspired many world notables, including former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who called Bhatt her ‘personal hero’. Clinton visited SEWA’s office in Ahmedabad twice and has publicly lauded SEWA’s micro-finance work.Along her journey, Bhatt was nationally and internationally feted with honours, including Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership and France’s Légion d’honneur.#elabhatt #womenwellness #womensafety #womenpower #womenforchange

There are a lot of creepy men out there and we have all been uncomfortable and a lot of times we are not able to do much about it. Women, of course  have been put in this situation by men for ages now. Here's how to deal with men that make you feel uncomfortable 1. Set limits 2. Do not look away ( DO not take eve teasing lightly, this could become something serious later, don't tell yourself no this isn't happening that's the worst thing you will do, you have to be alert and take care of yourself)3. Learn to say NO4. practice being direct ( Let your abuser know they have been making you feel uncomfortable, tell them directly so, atleast they could try changing their behavior)5. Don't let someone make you feel guilty ( you cannot show them any empathy, of even have a soft side with them, they are monsters and just don't deserve it)6. Take Charge of the situation7. Avoid it all together 8. Involve an elder person9. Take a stand up and Look out 10. Alert appropriate authorities ( this is the most important step)#womensafety

What are we doing as an Employer to safeguard our woman employees against Sexual Harassment?Do you have an Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy in place?According to the National Commission of Women - 2019 - 330 complaints received 2020 - 201 complaints received2021 - 376 complaints received"Sexual harassment could be in the form of inappropriate remarks or gestures to make a woman feel uncomfortable. With several employees now working from home, there seems to be a thin line between cyber harassment and sexual harassment. Calling at odd times seems to be a common problem now, while other cases also include putting up inappropriate pictures in the background during a video call, says Rekha Sharma, Chairperson of the National Commission for Women.Some insights that you could implement for making for a safe and secure Workplace..#safeworkplace #womensafety #sexualharassmentatworkplace Suven Consultants and Technology Pvt.Ltd.

Do the results surprise you, though? 🧐There is a general feeling among women that they are less safe than men, and this feeling is often based on personal experiences or observations of the world around them. 🌎 🙋‍♀️ Women are more likely to be the victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, and they also tend to live in fear of these things happening to them.Source: OPN#MySafetyCircle #PersonalSafetyApp #PersonalSafety #WomenSafety #Walking Alone #WalkingAtNight

In research done in the UK with 16,112 people aged 16 and over, 50% of women said that they feel unsafe walking alone after nightfall in a busy public place, such as a high street or railway station, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).When women don’t feel safe in cities, they feel limited to participate in public life, which has a negative impact on their education and careers. It affects their rights to move freely. How to make women feel safer in urban areas?The Womanity Award partner Safetipin, from India, is a social enterprise that has worked in across 35 cities globally. They offer digital tools in hands of urban stakeholders that have been designed to bring gender lens to urban infrastructure to enable girls and women to access public spaces more freely. They found out that eight parameters help to understand the perception of safety of public spaces. These parameters include lighting, quality of walk paths, accessibility to public transport, presence of people (specially women and children. The Womanity Foundation has supported a partnership between worked closely with Safetipin and SOUL CITY INSTITUTE from South Africa, to adapt a program to create safe cities for women and girls in Durban.n.If you want to learn more about their program, click here : https://lnkd.in/eR_H_A65#WomenRights #SafeCities #WomenSafety

Do You Know?The term 'Sexual Harassment' was coined in 1974 in the courts of United States of America for the very first time. The Case of Cornell UniversityA female laboratory employee quit her job because of the unwelcome sexual advances made by a colleague, a scientist. She was denied unemployement insurance because she did not have a 'reasonable' cause to leave her job.Later on, some more cases were presented before the Judicial Committee of US Senate. This made them realise that, sexual harassment is a great manace to workplace conditions and it is necessary to find a way to combat it. And, ensure safety of women at workplace. This is where in the cases of 1974, the term, 'Sexual Harassment' was coined.  Would you like to add on this?#Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee  #externalmember #mwcd #law #traininganddevelopment  #leaders  #linkedin  #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment #equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh  #work #gender #india

Is it a derogatory to call Minor girl ‘hot or item’?Yes it is,Special judge SJ Ansari said that the term objectified women in a sexual manner and would attract the offence of outraging modesty of woman under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Mumbai Court convicted the businessman under Sections 354 IPC and provisions under the Protection of Children under Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and sentenced him to 1.5 years in jail.I think that will be a good initiative for protection of child from road side romeo. #womensafety #judgement #ipc #safetymatters #order

If there is one thing you would do to give women the freedom to walk alone at anytime, anywhere. What would that be …! Well, we thought it should be something that would make every girl and woman feel and say "I'm Safe" everywhere. We at Ruah Tech Solutions, with a team of revolutionaries, have meticulously researched and designed the I'm Safe Women Safety App The very essence of I’m safe is giving a safe place for women to feel bold enough to reach out, a platform to voice out, and to enjoy being absolutely secure.  "I'm Safe" is going to crowdfunding via the Go Fund Me platform to raise funds to develop a technological solution to prevent the abuse many women face.  If you would love to donate and be a part of this huge vision, visit https://join.imsafe.app/ . Also, please spread the word to anyone whom you think is keen on creating a world that is free of abuse, rape, and any other unwelcoming issue that matters to women. #womensafety #Imsafe #violenceprevention #abuse # #crowdfunding #safety #tech #posh #domesticviolence #stalking Daniel JacobSamson SelladuraiGiftson SelladuraiJeson DuthieAndrew Jerome

On a recent trip to the Bangalore airport, I decided to go ahead and book a Go Pink cab.Multiple reasons for that-1. I was travelling with my MIL so wanted that extra safety.2. My flight was early in the morning so I had to be there around 3 AM.3. I was just curious on how the experience would be. To be honest, my experience wasn't that great as there were multiple hiccups along the way untill we reached airport. Along with the fact that it's definitely more expensive than the usual Ola/Uber or even airport taxi.But the core thought I had all that while was why ? why do I need to resort to a female driven cab ? why do I have to shell that extra money ? But the truth lies here. Its a problem in our country. Women safety is an issue we cannot neglect. I am glad there are solutions coming towards catering to it such as Go pink cabs but the real deal would be when any female of our country won't have to think twice when stepping out of her house.

First they stare, then they threaten and then we read scary shameful stories in news!It’s an incident that I decided to share as it concerns women safety, and on Linkedin we all keep harping about it. This is really shocking and terrifying, I took Ola  cab from my place to work place and during my ride, I was kind of engrossed in watching some content, and to my surprise rather shock, the driver was constantly ogling at me via the rear view mirror of the cab, and suddenly started slowing down the cab and upon enquiring he seemed to be more adamant about staring at me in the creepiest of manner.Trusting Ola I registered a complaint and guess what the driver called me up to ask my address at 11pm! Here, Ola is bragging about safety, technological advancement and more but failed miserably to keep a customer anonymous in case of such crisis situation. This makes more sad, coz I have always trusted the brand. Attaching screenshots of the driver and his threatening call. This is for people taking rides in and around Noida.Vehicle number: UP16FT2971Driver contact number: +919319671630Ola #safety #noida #share #womensafety #ola

Mater of concernOla , Last week when i was travelling to Noida sector 18 via Ola cab, the driver asked me to cancel the ride and forced me to come without ola intermediary so that he won’t  be liable to pay the charges to Ola, i had to agree him as i was running out of time and had to reach ASAP to my destination as there were no other cabs available nearby at that time.I got agree but deep down somewhere I was constantly thinking that this isn’t safe. What if something wrong would have happened?Ola  would you be responsible? Besides this now ill have to pay 50 Rs of extra charges as penulty for cancelling the previous ride.This is not the first time with Ola cab services. This is a matter of serious concern. Kindly take this into consideration Ola  #noida #olacabs #delhincr #womensafety

Big appeal to Uber I am a daily user of Uber. Today I booked a ride on 6:52 pm with driver named Girish. He even didn’t know to drive, he hitted two vehicles on a turn a car and a bike and started shouting on me with no reason. He was either drunk or psycho. It was very scary situation to me as I have ended the ride halfway of my destination. After that even he was shouting that why have I booked ride . Please it’s a big request to you to look into this as many girls travels alone in cabs. He is such a dangerous person . 🙏🏻#uber #uberindia #womensafety

Prevention is Better than Cure!!A quick checklist that will help employers/ business owners/ HR managers to strategise for a better culture and create a safe environment. If we are strong enough on prevention mechanism, lesser time & other resources are required on redressal part. Here you go...1. Encourage a gender sensitive environment at workplace.2. Establish an internal policy for prevention, prohibition & redressal of SH at workplace.3. Organise workshops & awareness sessions for employees (irrespective of gender).4. Formulate & Train your Internal Committee thoroughly on the POSH Act, after all the IC holds the powers of a Civil Court.5. Display the Do's & Don'ts regarding the behaviours to be showcased at the workplace and the consequences there of. 6. Provide names & contact numbers of the IC members on the notice board displays so that every employee know where to reachout in times of need. 7.Facilitate IC with all that it needs in case of a complaint.8. Provide proper handholding to the aggrieved woman if she chooses to file complain of SH under IPC.9. Sexual Harassment should be treated as a severe misconduct and set an example by leading.10. Do talk to the employees on random basis in day to day working life to know & understand, how they perceive the work environment.Last, but not the least....11. Set-up a robust monitoring system for timely submission of reports to District Officer.Do you have more points to add?#Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee #externalmember #externalmember #mwcd #law#traininganddevelopment #leaders #linkedin #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment#equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh  #work #gender #india

Do the results surprise you, though? 🧐There is a general feeling among women that they are less safe than men, and this feeling is often based on personal experiences or observations of the world around them. 🌎 🙋‍♀️ Women are more likely to be the victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, and they also tend to live in fear of these things happening to them.Source: OPN#MySafetyCircle #PersonalSafetyApp #PersonalSafety #WomenSafety #Walking Alone #WalkingAtNight

Diwali 🪔 💰⚡️💫It’s that time of the year again , which I witnessed after two years .. Apartments lit up, homes filled with glam, galore and mithais (Sweets) , stores over flooding with buyers , streets shining bright with the lanterns throwing its light in the darkness of the night, sellers selling products with sky high rates (same product would cost 1/4 of the price otherwise,but festive) kids WANTING fire crackers  (to add up the Pollution - Noise and Air), fitness freaks gorging on their favorites, families gathering, Offices filled with colleagues and brightened up work stations (which would otherwise be piled with papers ,files) .. celebrating life and thanking for being alive while escaping the fatal virus which transformed our lives in each way#festivalsofindia #festivevibes 💫Interestingly, I discovered the actual names of my neighbors for the first time,also my School Teacher stays in the same society as mine, while I ran pillar to post for my documents to be notarized - there is an Advocate who is practicing on the 6th floor past 3 decades, met the families’ of domestic help, closet spilling outfits and assisting Mom in her domain with my culinary skills. All in all, a feeling worth processing!! Besides that , it hurted like hell to read and watch the horrendous news about the Spike in Rape cases all across the nation. Women being objectified as the weaker sex and used by Men.Dear Men, this Diwali , I Wish you all a Healthy and Happy life. Not only being healthy & fit but also lifting up the deprived and being the shining armor enabling women in the country to move around safely and with DignityHappy Diwali 💫#festiveseason #postpandemicfestive #festivalsofindia #womensafety #safetyfirst

Women stand on equal footing as any other member of the human race, yet their safety is often taken for granted. Even at home, which is supposed to be a safe space, their dignity and rights are violated. Women are a vast reservoir of talent and potential. The unending "buts'', ''ifs'' and "howevers'' are preventing this potential from being realised. Committing to women’s safety for a Better and Safer Bengaluru is the need of the hour. B.PAC champions for women’s safety and empowerment and maintains that the domain needs to go through a drastic overhaul. Here are a few measures and policies that can be implemented to strengthen women’s safety in all spheres of life.

Do you Know....The Conciliation...?There is a provision in the POSH Act that opens the gates of settlement between the parties. This is called Conciliation.However, there are some norms to it.1. It is the responsibility of Internal Committee to suggest the option of Conciliation to the complainant in the first interaction.2. Conciliation is to be done before the investigation starts.3. This option can be opted only on the request of the complainant.4. No monetary settlement allowed in this process.5. No further inquiry is to be done if the complainant opted for conciliation.Now, my question is...as to why has Law kept the option of 'Conciliation' at all?What is your say on it?#Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee #externalmember #mwcd #law #traininganddevelopment #leaders #linkedin #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment#equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh #work #gender #india

The safety of women in public transports has been a matter of concern and the nucleus of many discussions on women safety and empowerment. But, through various safety measures taken by transport authorities across the country, public transportation is turning into a safe haven for women. One such effort is the DURGA (Dare to Understand behavior, Respond appropriately and Guard ourselves Ably) alarm, which is a unique citizens’ initiative, installed by the BMTC in buses, to assist women and girls in preventing crime. The series of Durga alarm switches installed allow any woman or child in the bus to alert authorities and other passengers, about any form of harassment. The set of switches have pictorial messaging to aid individuals with language barriers and are positioned at a comfortable height so that even children may reach them.So far, DURGA alarms have been making travelling within Bengaluru a lot safer and secure. Such initiatives must be encouraged as they open up new avenues in the sphere of women’s empowerment. Though women safety is a shared responsibility, a lot of it lies in your hands too. Let’s remain informed, educated and spread awareness on the same to keep gender-based crimes at bay! ..#BPAC #BSAFEFriday #BSAFE #womensafety #womenempowerment Kiran Mazumdar Shaw Revathy Ashok Mohandas Pai RK Misra Durga BMTC

Greetings Connections!I'm Happy to share that I have successfully completed my internship at the Women Safety Wing Telangana Police Department during my Summer internship. It was a great opportunity to work with Smt. Swati Lakra I.P.S Ma'am ADGP, Women Safety Wing, Telangana Police, and Smt. Sumathi Badugula, I.P.S, DIG, Women Safety& CID, Telangana Police. The entire Team of Women Safety Wing is working Day and night to ensure Women Safety in the State.  I have been attached to the SHE Module and the Cyber Safety Module where I got an opportunity to work on their various initiatives and projects which in true spirits ensure the safety of Women and Children in the state. The internship experience at the Woman safety wing Telangana police department moulded me to be a skilled and insightful student and an aware citizen. In addition to being excellent during my internship escapades, I have also actively participated in various tasks which enhanced my legal knowledge as well as immensely helped me to look at various aspects related to Women safety, laws, and understanding the work of the Women safety Wing in a new light. At last many thanks to  Sriharshitha Chada ma'am for her  constant support throughout the internship period. #police #opportunity #experience #connections #womensafety #telanganapolice #Sheteams #Cybermodule #internship .

[EXPANDING A LIFELINE TO CRITICAL HEALTH & SAFETY SERVICES] While #Indigenous women and girls comprise only 4% of the total female population in #Canada, they represent 24% of female homicide victims and are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other women in Canada. Developed in partnership with Indigenous-led organizations, the TELUS "Mobility for Good for Indigenous Women at Risk" program provides free smartphones and fully subsidized talk, text and data plans to Indigenous women, girls or gender diverse people. The program provides a critical lifeline to Indigenous-led services, wellness resources, and their support networks.“Having a cellular device and reliable network is a vital lifeline, ensuring no matter where you live or socio-economic status, you can always access critical health, safety and wellness services,” said Jill Schnarr, Chief Social Innovation Officer, TELUS. “The expansion of Mobility for Good for Indigenous Women at Risk to Ontario is part of our ongoing commitment to be a valued partner in advancing Reconciliation and responding to the 231 Calls for Justice, specifically Justice 15 to support and promote Indigenous women’s health, safety and wellness. Leveraging our world-leading technology for good, we are proud to partner with Indigenous-led organizations that are helping deliver accessible services to prevent and end violence, and offering Indigenous women and girls in need a path to independence, enabling them to make safe choices for themselves and their families.”“We are honoured to work with TELUS on this initiative to support learnings on reconciliation and provide essential connection tools for women of the community,” said @Pamela Hart, Executive Director, Native Women's Resource Centre of Toronto. “Through the pandemic and continuously, the community faces barriers, disconnection and through provision of devices, we can maintain interactions. It is more than a phone or device, it’s connection to community, learning, culture and sometimes, a lifeline.”Continue reading...https://lnkd.in/gP52sVTR #community #people #health #communityhealth #indigenouswomen #womenshealth #womensafety #familyservices #socialimpact #corporatesocialresponsibility    via Jennifer Kirner

No authority is responding.Very shame to say that, these kind of things happening in top metropolitan cities #hyderabad and that to in educational institutions #indianarmy is sacrificing their lives for us. But there is no #safety in India. What is the use of their sacrifice? They are living for us...Everything is favour to political persons and business men. No justice for common man. No use of #police. Most of them are working for saving politicians,  business men and rich people.we have technology to do anything in minutes. But no rule to hang such kind of victims within hous.

An AppealSometimes, either of the parties, the complainant or the respondant is not satisfied with the recommendations presented by the Internal Committee. Section 18 of the POSH Act 2013 comes to rescue in this scenario. Wherein, either of the parties have the right to appeal in the appropriate court to review the recommendation of the IC. Please be noted, the appeal is there to recheck if there is any factual or legal error in the proceedings of the case that produced the concerned outcome. Appeal does not allow re-opening of the case. It is also not about introducing new evidances, wittnesses or re-argue the facts.As per the time frame specified in the law, the appeal must be filed within 90 days of the recommendation of the ICC. Any question regarding the investigation process?I am here to help!!#Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee  #externalmember #mwcd #law#traininganddevelopment #leaders #linkedin #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment#equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh  #work #gender #india

The ImpactIt is very evident that government and the law has been very vigilant in safeguarding women from sexual harassment at workplace but the question is...... how impactful has it been. Despite great efforts, a very significant sector is still in the dark with the provisions of this statute. My concern here is the MSME Sector. In the Annual reports of majority of the Small & Medium Enterprises, , it is reported - ‘ No case reported and no case pending’.We all witness in newspapers every morning with our daily sip of tea, a woman/girl undergoes eve teasing every minute and a woman/ girl is raped in every 3 minutes in India. How can we believe that there has been no case of sexual Harassment in MSME sector. The reality is that the cases have not been reported. What is your say on this?What can be the reasond behind this flaw?#Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee #externalmember #externalmember #mwcd #law#traininganddevelopment #leaders #linkedin #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment#equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh

#court15 There are currently 14 Specialist Family Violence Courts across Victoria, but none servicing the North East. Our families are sadly missing out on vital services. Which is why we are working so hard to bring a 15th court to our region. Our rates of family violence are alarmingly above the state average. The Centre Against Violence opened 362 family violence cases in the 21/22 financial year and is on track to service over 450 this financial year. We estimate 80% of these clients will need legal support and we know the Hume Riverina Community Legal Service is at full capacity and turning away over half of their current referrals. Today a fully costed proposal for the 15th Court and Legal Aid Office was sent to the responsible Victorian ministers. The proposal was put together by a panel of diverse and extraordinary people. We thank them for their support. The panel - led by Tania Maxwell MP includes, Hume Riverina Community Legal Service, Gateway Health,  Women's Centre for Health and Wellbeing Albury Wodonga, victim survivors, Rural City of Wangaratta mayor Dean Rees, Wodonga Council deputy mayor Graeme Simpfendorfer and Indigo Shire Council Cr Sophie Price.

AROEHAN organised a Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy at Workplace (POSH) Workshop for the team on October 7th at Jawhar. The important session was facilitated by Advocate Machindra Kapare, an HR Generalist with more than 17 years of experience in HR & Technical capacity, who has fought more than 100 cases of sexual harassment.Adv. Kapare delivered a lecture on the history of the act and how it has evolved over decades. He reflected on important provisions of the POSH act including the Internal Complaint Committee, the Local Committee, the procedure of complaints, conciliation, details of the aftermath of complaints, the entitlements of victims, and duties of employer and colleagues in the situation. The session was largely interactive and Mr. Kapare addressed every concern of the participants with thorough detail.The session was attended by AROEHAN's Chairperson Helen Joseph, Founder Anjali Kanitkar, and Trustee Vivek Patwardhan, who also shed light on the issue. We thank Adv.

Gender-based harassment, violence, and discrimination are pervasive practices affecting millions of female workers worldwide. Consider the following statistics (source: peoplemattersglobal.com):- In Bengaluru, the hub of India’s high-tech industry, 60% of women workers in the garment industry reportedly faced intimidation and violence while on the job; nearly 15% of female workers said that they have faced sexual violence in hostile workplaces.- More than 50% of British female workers have faced sexual harassment at work.- 38% of women surveyed in the United States said they were sexually harassed at the workplace.Such statistics are worrying, indeed. Workplace harassment and violence against women will continue to haunt employers unless they are willing to take decisive action. Although various countries around the globe have enacted laws and laid down rules to ensure occupational safety and prevent gender-based harassment or violence to make workplaces safer for female workers, compliance on part of employers is less than half the battle won. A lot more needs to be done.As an employer or someone in a leadership role, you can go the extra mile to make your workplace safe for women employees. Here in this post, we discuss five ways you can play a decisive role in promoting the safety of women workers in your company.#HRAdvice #WomensWeek #womensafeworkplace #womensafety #genderequality #leadership

An Observation: POSH in MSME SectorAs per the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, the POSH compliance is mandatory in every organization having more than 10 workers (irrespective of gender). The corporates are proactive in this compliance. But the concern is how educated and prompt our MSMEs are in complying with this law. The questions arise are -1. Do our SME owners know about this law?2. Are they following this law in its true spirit or just on papers?3. Are the employees aware of this Act?4. Is the Internal Committee formed?5. As per Section 21 of POSH Act 2013, is there an Annual Report submitted to the District Officer?6. As per the Gazette of India Extraordinary (point 20), has the timely monitoring of annual reports & surprise visits being conducted in these establishments?In the majority of the scenarios, the answer is “NO”.POSH Act is still not implemented in MSME sectors in its true spirit, the reasons may be many. Some of them I have tried to point out:1. Lack of awareness in owners of these organizations in  MSME sector. 2. Deliberate ignorance to create awareness among the employees under the perceived threat of malicious complaints from the  women employees on the ask of work. 3. No proper monitoring system for the due diligence and compliance of the law. 4. No proper hand holding for implementation of the Law in right sense. Please opine. #Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee #externalmember #externalmember #mwcd #law #traininganddevelopment  #leaders #linkedin #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment#equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh #work #gender #india

On Misandry and Misogyny.Earlier this year and last, Nigerian boys were killing women they called "girlfriends", it was a killing spree, every week there was news of a dead woman. Killing women all the time and they called it ritual killing.  I'm not even sure any of those boys were really caught are facing judgement in court. Imagine if this guy wasn't caught. It would have been news of women's death here and there in Ohio. 3,000 fucking women would be murdered.This is why the misogyny and misandry argument people try to have will never hold water.Misandrists don't go about killing men. When women hate men, they stay completely away from them. And this is rare, plus misandry is not systemic.Women who hate men avoid them and stay far away.But when it's misogynists, when men hate women, they have sex with them just to laugh at them. They marry them just to abuse them and stop them from achieving their dreams.They become bosses at work and lecturers at school just to stop giving women jobs and marks they deserve without first raping them.They become very close to families, just so they can rape and sexually abuse their daughters.They have daughters and stop them from going to school. Misogyny is to systemic. That even women are taught to hate other women. Blame women and Curse women for men harming them.Misandry is a reaction to misogyny, therefore there will be no misandry if there were no misogyny.# #people #school #dismantlethepatriachy #womensafety #women # #work #men #fuckthepatriachy

Prevention is Better than Cure!!A quick checklist that will help employers/ business owners/ HR managers to strategise for a better culture and create a safe environment. If we are strong enough on prevention mechanism, lesser time & other resources are required on redressal part. Here you go...1. Encourage a gender sensitive environment at workplace.2. Establish an internal policy for prevention, prohibition & redressal of SH at workplace.3. Organise workshops & awareness sessions for employees (irrespective of gender).4. Formulate & Train your Internal Committee thoroughly on the POSH Act, after all the IC holds the powers of a Civil Court.5. Display the Do's & Don'ts regarding the behaviours to be showcased at the workplace and the consequences there of. 6. Provide names & contact numbers of the IC members on the notice board displays so that every employee know where to reachout in times of need. 7.Facilitate IC with all that it needs in case of a complaint.8. Provide proper handholding to the aggrieved woman if she chooses to file complain of SH under IPC.9. Sexual Harassment should be treated as a severe misconduct and set an example by leading.10. Do talk to the employees on random basis in day to day working life to know & understand, how they perceive the work environment.Last, but not the least....11. Set-up a robust monitoring system for timely submission of reports to District Officer.Do you have more points to add?#Posh #compliance #womensafety #msme #govofindia #poshawareness #chiefminister #ngo#womenempowerment #sexualharassment #harassment #law #humanresource #sme #internalcommittee #externalmember #externalmember #mwcd #law#traininganddevelopment #leaders #linkedin #smallbusiness #smallbusinessindia #smallbusinessowner #abuse #harassment#equalityintheworkplace #humanresourcesmanager #hrheads #wfh  #work #gender #india

In today's world, it's easy to get caught up in negative thinking. With all the negativity that surrounds us, it's no wonder that so many people struggle with self-doubt and low self-esteem. However, it's important to remember that life and death are in the power of your tongue. What you say to yourself has a profound impact on your thoughts, emotions, and actions. If you want to live a happy and successful life, you need to start speaking positive affirmations to yourself on a daily basis. Doing so will help you overcome negative thinking patterns, boost your self-confidence, and improve your overall outlook on life.#selflovetips #selflovechallenge #selfmastery #bodylove #spiritualjourneys #mentalhealthawareness #selflove #selfacceptance #selflove #selfdiscovery #mentalhealthmatters #personalgrowthtips #she #selfcaretips #mentalhealth #womensafety #westernwomen #womensmovement #violenceagainstwomen #womenwhohustle #girlbosstribe #bossbabequotes #womenceomindset #bossbabes #sheboss #feminism #womensafety #women #feminist

As a service we know that not all abuse is reported to the police, and as the Serious Crime Caseworker, I’m here to support anyone who’s been impacted by abuse. I support survivors regardless of how long ago the incidents happened or whether the police were involved. Support is free and confidential and I work closely with local independent domestic violence advocates (IDVAs) and independent sexual violence advocates (ISVAs). I can help with contacting the police or other criminal justice agencies on your behalf, or advocating with statutory services if needed. If needed as a service we can refer to professional counselling or talking therapy if needed”.If you have not done so already, please hop online at https://lnkd.in/eWRkbifh to book your free place to attend.We look forward to seeing you there!#Communityinterestcompany#Diversitymatters #Inclusion #safetyonthestreets #womensafety #walkatnight #womansafety #safewomen #makeallwomensafe

Women feel reluctant to report sexual harassment at the workplace and find it difficult to continue with the organization because of gender bias. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also addressed this issue at the National Labour Conference about the dire need to encourage women to join and stay in the workforce. High time companies need to improve the work culture to help retain more women employees. https://lnkd.in/d7BhwTDV#poshact #internalcommittee #poshlaw #sexualharassmentatworkplace #preventionofsexualharassment #womensafety #sexualharassmentawareness

Pre-pandemic, I visited Kerala where, I was able to witness the level of development and standards of their culture in the state. This is a state where every morning, every individual goes to work, earns money and lives a productive life. Here, people are taught to be independent and financially stable. Respect and safety for women is no more a matter of debate, they have already achieved it. They live with integrity and their day ends with the expectation of fulfilling their dreams for tomorrow.  It is a perfect example stating that efficient government intervention and a will to adapt to change in the communities, can both monetarily and socially drive a positive change in the country. Education can nurture an individual whereas a change can transform the entire philosophy of radical human existence.  #POWERTOKNOW#education #work #people #development #culture #change #womensafety #respect #societyandculture #tourism

https://lnkd.in/gk8SPTJvAfter this very unfortunate incident, it's clear that we need to develop a system that can effectively provide a safety and support system to help protect the people in need in our community. What happened to Sathya is absolutely horrifying, and what's worse is that the perpetrator got away before anybody could react. This is exactly why we need services like DoWhistle(safety) to garner public attention to these issues - with the press of one button, anyone on the scene could've alerted volunteers near them and prevented the instigator from being able to escape the consequences of his crime. Perhaps, if the alarm had been sounded beforehand, Sathya could've been saved too. Whatever the case, we, as a community, should at least learn now that we need to do whatever we can to put an end to this never-ending cycle of human cruelty, and one way we can hope to achieve this is by building a vast community on DoWhistle(safety) to help support the people in our proximity. Hopefully, we can make this the last instance where the perpetrator gets off scot-free, and we can give our victims the justice they deserve.#SpontaneousWorld #DoWhistle #WomenSafety #CommunityHelp #help #safety #react #community #people

Women’s safety in India is an issue that has long been debated and while most women are now used to looking out for themselves, one does not expect to feel unsafe in public spaces supposed to protect them. However, recently, a Diwali fest at Delhi University’s Miranda House, the prestigious all-women college, has raised questions on whether women are actually safe in any space at all. Read the entire article here: https://lnkd.in/dU4svBfR#womenempoweringwomen #sisterhood #ambitiouswomen #girlssupportinggirls #safetyfirst #selfcare #quotes #motivation #thoughtsoftheday #Justice #randommemes #freedom #freeyourself #brave #besafe #womensafety #feminism #travel #womensafetyapp #mumbai #safetyawareness #feelphree #womenintech #rights #genderequality #humanrights #womenvoices

New ANROWS report out today. This is another piece in our emerging evidence base on adolescent violence in the home #AVITH. I think the following quote stands out for me from the interviews with mums and practitioners. One practitioner said, "This is not a traditional #familyviolence dynamic, and it can be very hard for services to understand and to support the people, the victims as well as the perpetrator. That's the other thing: the victim would want the perpetrator to be helped, not "Okay, lock that person up, they've hurt me." #AVITH, especially where young people have #disability, is an extremely complex situation. This study shows how conflicting the emotions and responses of parents are. They are trying to protect themselves as well as all their children - including the child using violence. Support is so limited, however, that the options are often just deal with it yourself or have your child arrested or removed by child protection. We need #policymakers to understand this choice is not enough. We need supports that help keep all family members safe and support healing. This requires system-wide reform, but one area of great need is for more #DFV services who will work with families where the person using violence remains in the home. We cannot have help predicated upon parents forcing their children out of the home. #research #socialpolicy #domesticviolence #childprotection #childwelfare #womensafety

#Internationaldayofgirlchild2022 #girlchild Every year October 11 is observed as the International Day of Girl Child to discuss the gender discrimination faced by girls across the globe. On this day, several organizations including the United Nations discuss issues related to child marriage, access to education, violation against women and more.  According to the latest reports, the sex ratio at birth (SRB) in India is 896 females for every 1000 males. There are a lot of social elements that have contributed to the disparity in the sex ratio. From time to time, the government of India has taken initiatives to strengthen and empower girl children. Today on the occasion of International Day of Girl Child, let us see what initiatives are taken up by the states in India to help girl child. Beti Bachao Abhiyan, Ladli Lakshmi Yojana of Madhya Pradesh, Ladli Scheme and the Kanya Kosh Scheme, Karnataka Bhagyashree Scheme, National Scheme of incentives for the girls of secondary Education, The Chief Minister’s Girl Child Protection Scheme of Tamil Nadu, Mazi Kanya Bhagyashree Scheme of the Government of Maharashtra and many more schemes have played a significant role in reducing the existing gaps. However, it seems like there is a long way to go become India can make a progress in the Global Gender Gap Index.  On this occasion, let us know what more can the government do to safeguard, and empower the girl child in society. #girlchild #equality #genderequality #inequality #gendergap #girlchildday #safety #policies #publicpolicy #shemesforwomen #empowerment #girlempowerment #voiceofwomen #womenempowerment #womensafety #gender #education

Many of their apparently " taken for granted ' choices ofroutes and destinations are in fact the product of 'coping strategies.'Read the full paper here: https://lnkd.in/dg8seTng#womenempoweringwomen #sisterhood #ambitiouswomen #girlssupportinggirls #safetyfirst #selfcare #quotes #motivation #thoughtsoftheday #Justice #randommemes #freedom #freeyourself #brave #besafe #womensafety #feminism #travel #womensafetyapp #mumbai #safetyawareness #feelphree #womenintech #rights #genderequality #humanrights #womenvoices

Falls account for over 8 million hospital emergency room visits, representing over 20% in the lead cause of visits. Slip-and-fall’s account for over 1 million visits, women making up over 70% of these accidents.Slips and falls can be caused by a variety of issues, however, the two most common factors for women are:1.) The type of shoe worn during the slip and fall 2.) The type of floors they are walking on. When it comes to floors, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) contributes more than 2 million fall injuries each year to spills, damaged and slippery floors and flooring materials.Other common causes of slip and falls may include:➡️ Spilled foods or liquids➡️ Plumbing leaks➡️ Exposed cables or cords➡️ Uneven flooring➡️ Lack of handrails➡️ Failure to post warning signs about known hazardsIt’s important to be mindful of these factors and how they can occur.

Its easy to worry about the things that we think define us. We worry about our clothes, our hair, our weight, and a million other things. But the truth is that none of those things really matter. The only thing that matters is whats inside us. Its what we believe in and how we treat others that defines who we are. So don't waste your time worrying about the superficial things. Instead, focus on being the best person you can be. Be kind, be compassionate, and be true to yourself. Thats what really matters in life.Download our I'm Safe women's safety app now!

In India, in urban contexts, the effects of globalization have rendered women visible as workers in public spaces but it has not done away with the patriarchal notion that the ‘proper’ place of women is in the private while streets are a masculine domain. This kind of labeling of spaces creates a sense of insecurity within women in terms of their experience of city life.Read the entire article: https://lnkd.in/dW5cjUFG#womenempoweringwomen #sisterhood #ambitiouswomen #girlssupportinggirls #safetyfirst #selfcare #quotes #motivation #thoughtsoftheday #Justice #randommemes #freedom #freeyourself #brave #besafe #womensafety #feminism #travel #womensafetyapp #mumbai #safetyawareness #feelphree #womenintech #rights #genderequality #humanrights #womenvoices

#Internationaldayofgirlchild2022 #girlchild Every year October 11 is observed as the International Day of Girl Child to discuss the gender discrimination faced by girls across the globe. On this day, several organizations including the United Nations discuss issues related to child marriage, access to education, violation against women and more.  According to the latest reports, the sex ratio at birth (SRB) in India is 896 females for every 1000 males. There are a lot of social elements that have contributed to the disparity in the sex ratio. From time to time, the government of India has taken initiatives to strengthen and empower girl children. Today on the occasion of International Day of Girl Child, let us see what initiatives are taken up by the states in India to help girl child. Beti Bachao Abhiyan, Ladli Lakshmi Yojana of Madhya Pradesh, Ladli Scheme and the Kanya Kosh Scheme, Karnataka Bhagyashree Scheme, National Scheme of incentives for the girls of secondary Education, The Chief Minister’s Girl Child Protection Scheme of Tamil Nadu, Mazi Kanya Bhagyashree Scheme of the Government of Maharashtra and many more schemes have played a significant role in reducing the existing gaps. However, it seems like there is a long way to go become India can make a progress in the Global Gender Gap Index.  On this occasion, let us know what more can the government do to safeguard, and empower girl child in society. #girlchild #equality #genderequality #inequality #gendergap #girlchildday #safety #policies #publicpolicy #shemesforwomen #empowerment #girlempowerment #voiceofwomen #womenempowerment #womensafety

Women's right to space - public or private - is a dicey issue in India, a male-dominated society. The recent crimes against women only reiterate that life for the Indian woman is difficult; as far as adjectives go, it's challenging, an uphill task, a never-ending test of physical and mental strength.Read the entire article here: https://lnkd.in/d225CMM6#womenempoweringwomen #sisterhood #ambitiouswomen #girlssupportinggirls #safetyfirst #selfcare #quotes #motivation #thoughtsoftheday #Justice #randommemes #freedom #freeyourself #brave #besafe #womensafety #feminism #travel #womensafetyapp #mumbai #safetyawareness #feelphree #womenintech #rights #genderequality #humanrights #womenvoices

Time for oneself is important regardless of how happy a person is with their current situation. When people are constantly putting others before themselves, they run the risk of becoming overwhelmed and bogged down with too many obligations. Learning to prioritize personal time leads to a more balanced and healthy lifestyle. By making this a priority, individuals can lead happier and less stressed lives.Follow @imsafeapp#westernwomen #womensmovement #violenceagainstwomen #womenwhohustle #girlbosstribe #bossbabequotes #womenceomindset #bossbabes #sheboss #feminism #womensafety #women #feminist #imsafeapp #strongwomen #femaleceos #fempreneurs #unitedkingdom #unitedstates #australia #womenempowerment

It is time to give importance to gender equality. Women must be given the same opportunities as men, whether it is in education, employment, or political participation. They should be able to make their own choices and decisions without being influenced by others. Only then can we claim to have a truly equal society.#westernwomen #womensmovement #violenceagainstwomen #womenwhohustle #girlbosstribe #bossbabequotes #womenceomindset #bossbabes #sheboss #feminism #womensafety #women #feminist #imsafeapp #strongwomen #femaleceos #fempreneurs #unitedkingdom #unitedstates #australia #womenempowerment #mybodymychoice #equality #inspirationalwoman #wonderwomen #equalrightsforall #stopviolence #endviolence #womensrights #stopvictimblaming
